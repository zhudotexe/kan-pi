In both innings, the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship. The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese, who was named World Series MVP. The Series was also known for the blowout Game\u00a03, in which Cardinals player Albert Pujols hit three home runs, a World Series feat previously accomplished only by Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, and subsequently by Pablo Sandoval in 2012. In 2020, ESPN named the 2011 World Series the fifth greatest of all-time.[4]\n\n\nThe Series began on October 19, earlier than the previous season, so that no games would be played in November.[5] The Cardinals enjoyed home-field advantage for the series because the NL won the 2011 All-Star Game 5\u20131 on July 12.[6] The 2011 World Series was the first World Series to go all seven games since the 2002 Series.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 MLB Postseason\n\nThe Rangers were appearing in their second consecutive World Series; they lost the 2010 Series to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They were the first American League team to play in consecutive World Series since the New York Yankees did it from 1998 to 2001.[7] They earned their postseason berth by winning the American League West division, then defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Division Series and the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\nThe Cardinals were appearing in their 18th World Series, and third in eight years.[8] They lost to the Boston Red Sox in 2004, but won in 2006 against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals earned their postseason berth by winning the National League Wild Card on the last day of the regular season, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\nThis Series was only the second time the Rangers and the Cardinals played each other; they met in regular-season interleague play in 2004, when the Cardinals won two of a three-game series in Texas.[9] This was the first World Series assignment for umpires Greg Gibson and Ron Kulpa. Each of the other umpires had previously worked one World Series.[10]\n\n\nThe Cardinals were supported by fans brandishing Rally Squirrel memorabilia that alluded to a squirrel that ran across the field during a playoff game.\n\n\nNational anthem singers featured\nGame one: Scotty McCreery,\nGame two: Trace Adkins,\nGame three: Ronnie Dunn,\nGame four: Zooey Deschanel,\nGame five: Demi Lovato,\nGame six: Joe, and\nGame seven: Chris Daughtry (from Daughtry)\n\n\n\n![](image)Rangers newcomer Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 won both a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award for his efforts during the regular season.\n### Texas Rangers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Texas Rangers season\n\nThis was the Rangers' second appearance in the World Series. Heading into 2010, their 50th season as a franchise (counting its time as the **Washington Senators**), the team was the only one in Major League Baseball never to win a postseason series,[9] and was among three teams (along with the Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals) never to appear in the World Series. That season, however, the Rangers won their first postseason series and made their first appearance in the World Series, only to lose to the San Francisco Giants in five games.\n\n\nDuring the offseason, Chuck Greenberg, who purchased the Rangers from Tom Hicks during the 2010 season along with Nolan Ryan, sold his interest in the team to Ryan, making him the Rangers' principal owner.[11] Notable player departures during the offseason included pitcher Cliff Lee and outfielder/designated hitter Vladimir Guerrero (both to free agency) and catcher Bengie Molina, who retired. Notable free agent additions during the offseason included pitchers Yoshinori Tateyama and Brandon Webb, catcher Yorvit Torrealba, and third-baseman Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9. In January 2011, as part of a three-way trade with the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the Rangers acquired catcher Mike Napoli in exchange for pitcher Frank Francisco. During the season, the team acquired pitcher Koji Uehara from the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for infielder Chris Davis, and Mike Adams from the San Diego Padres in exchange for two minor-league pitchers. Pitcher Arthur Rhodes was released and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals days later; as a result, Rhodes would have been entitled to receive a World Series ring regardless of which team won.[12][13]\n\n\nWith the exception of one day in late April and a brief stretch in early May, the Rangers led the American League West for most of the season. They finished the season with a franchise record 96\u201366 (.593 winning percentage) and won their second consecutive and 5th overall division title, 10 games ahead of the second-place Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. They also set a franchise record for home attendance of 2,946,949.[14] Texas also earned the most shutouts in the American League. All 5 members of the opening day starting rotation stayed in the rotation for the entire year. C. J. Wilson tied for the league lead in starts with 34 while Derek Holland tied for second in shutouts with 4 (tied for first in the American League), with each pitcher racking up at least 13 wins. The offense also had another good year with 3 players getting 30-plus home runs for the first time in team history, and Ian Kinsler completing his second 30\u201330 season.\n\n\nIn the postseason, the Rangers were the #2 seed in the AL. They defeated the wild-card Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the American League Division Series. They then defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games in the American League Championship Series to reach their second consecutive appearance in the World Series.\n\n\nThe Rangers lost home-field advantage in the World Series as a result of the AL team, managed by Rangers manager Ron Washington, losing the 2011 All-Star Game, when Ranger ace C. J. Wilson surrendered the game-winning three-run homer to Prince Fielder.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardinals third baseman David Freese experienced a torrid hitting streak in the postseason, being named NLCS MVP in 2011.\n### St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 St. Louis Cardinals season\n\nThe Cardinals made their first World Series appearance since 2006, when they defeated the Detroit Tigers 4 games to 1 to win their National League-leading 10th World Series title. This was manager Tony La Russa's 6th World Series appearance as manager and his third with the Cardinals. The Cardinals' last postseason appearance was in 2009, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. They finished the 2010 season with a record of 86\u201376 (.531), finishing in second place in the National League Central standings, 5 games behind the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n\nDuring the 2010 offseason, the team signed new contracts with manager Tony La Russa and picked up All-Star slugger Albert Pujols' club option. Notable offseason departures included shortstop Brendan Ryan (traded to the Seattle Mariners) and relief pitcher Blake Hawksworth (traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers). Additionally, during the offseason the team announced that ace pitcher Adam Wainwright would miss the entire season due to Tommy John surgery. Notable offseason additions included shortstop Ryan Theriot, outfielder Lance Berkman, catcher Gerald Laird, and infielder Nick Punto. In late April, after a number of blown saves, the Cardinals removed pitcher Ryan Franklin from the closer role, and released him on June 29. On July 27, the Cardinals sent outfielder Colby Rasmus and pitchers Trever Miller, Brian Tallet, and P. J. Walters to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitchers Edwin Jackson, Marc Rzepczynski, and Octavio Dotel, and outfielder Corey Patterson. They then acquired Rafael Furcal from the Dodgers in exchange for Alex Castellanos, a minor-league outfielder. On August 11, the team signed free agent pitcher Arthur Rhodes, who had been released by the Texas Rangers days earlier.\n\n\nThe Cardinals spent much of the early part of the 2011 season in first place in the NL Central standings but dropped to second place for good on July 27. On August 25, the team trailed the Atlanta Braves in the NL wild card standings by 10+1\u20442 games. The Cardinals amassed a 21\u20139 record from August 26 to September 27, while the Braves were 10\u201319 over that same interval. Meanwhile, on September 23, the Milwaukee Brewers clinched the NL Central division title. On September 28, with the Cardinals and Braves tied atop the Wild Card standings on the last day of the regular season, the Cardinals routed the Houston Astros 8\u20130 in Houston, while the Braves lost at home to the Philadelphia Phillies 4\u20133 in 13 innings, securing the Cardinals' second wild card postseason berth in franchise history. St. Louis finished with a record of 90\u201372, 6 games behind the Brewers in the NL Central but one ahead of the Braves in the Wild Card. They defeated the overall #1 seed Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series 3 games to 2, and then defeated the second-seeded Milwaukee Brewers (who were the first team in history to reach both NLCS and ALCS and the team the Cardinals faced in the 1982 World Series) in six games in the National League Championship Series.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*St. Louis won the series, 4\u20133.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 19 | Texas Rangers \u2013 2, **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 3 | Busch Stadium | 3:06 | 46,406[15] |\n| 2 | October 20 | **Texas Rangers** \u2013 2, St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 1 | Busch Stadium | 3:04 | 47,288[16] |\n| 3 | October 22 | **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 16, Texas Rangers \u2013 7 | Rangers Ballpark in Arlington | 4:04 | 51,462[17] |\n| 4 | October 23 | St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 0, **Texas Rangers** \u2013 4 | Rangers Ballpark in Arlington | 3:07 | 51,539[18] |\n| 5 | October 24 | St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 2, **Texas Rangers** \u2013 4 | Rangers Ballpark in Arlington | 3:31 | 51,459[19] |\n| 6 | October 27\u2020 | Texas Rangers \u2013 9, **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 10 (11) | Busch Stadium | 4:33 | 47,325[20] |\n| 7 | October 28 | Texas Rangers \u2013 2, **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 6 | Busch Stadium | 3:17 | 47,399[21] |\n\n\n\u2020: Postponed from October 26 due to rain[22]\n\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chris Carpenter, the winning pitcher in Game 1.\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 48\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C), drizzle\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **St. Louis** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | X | 3 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Chris Carpenter (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** C.

Wilson faced Chris Carpenter. Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first three innings. In the fourth, Albert Pujols was hit by a pitch to lead off the inning. After a double by Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman hit a single to drive both runners in. The lead wouldn't last long. Mike Napoli hit a two-run home run to tie the game in the very next inning. David Freese doubled in the sixth with one out, and moved to third on a wild pitch. After Yadier Molina struck out, and Nick Punto walked, Allen Craig entered the game, pinch-hitting for Carpenter. Alexi Ogando relieved Wilson, and tried to finish off the inning. Craig hit a 1\u20132 pitch down the right field line that was just out of reach of a sliding Nelson Cruz. Freese scored to give St. Louis the lead. In the seventh, the Cardinals ran into trouble as Cruz singled and Napoli walked to put two on with one out. Marc Rzepczynski came on to face pinch-hitter Craig Gentry and struck him out. Pinch-hitter Esteban Germ\u00e1n was the next batter. Rzepczynski struck him out as well. In the ninth, closer Jason Motte pitched an easy 1\u20132\u20133 inning to give St. Louis the win. Controversy surrounded the inning, as Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 was the victim of a blown call. Beltr\u00e9 grounded a ball to third, and Descalso threw the ball to first for the out, but replays showed he fouled the ball off his foot.\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Young hit the go-ahead sacrifice fly in the ninth inning for the Rangers.\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 51\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), mostly clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Texas** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 1\n |\n| St. Louis | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Mike Adams (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Jason Motte (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Neftal\u00ed Feliz (1)**Attendance:** 47,288Boxscore |\n\n\nGame\u00a02 saw a pitchers' duel between Jaime Garc\u00eda and Colby Lewis. Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first six innings. A pair of excellent defensive plays by Elvis Andrus stopped a couple of Cardinals rallies. In the seventh, David Freese again started a rally for St. Louis, much like in Game\u00a01. He singled with one out, and moved to third on a single by Nick Punto with two outs. Allen Craig pinch-hit for Garc\u00eda to face Alexi Ogando, setting up almost the same exact situation from the previous night. Again, Craig beat Ogando with a single to right field to drive in Freese. Jason Motte was brought in to save the game in the ninth. Ian Kinsler led off with a bloop single, and stole second with Andrus batting. Andrus singled into center field, and moved to second on the throw home, which got by Albert Pujols for an error. With runners on second and third, and none out, Tony La Russa switched in Arthur Rhodes for Motte. Consecutive sacrifice flies from Josh Hamilton and Michael Young gave Texas the lead. Neftal\u00ed Feliz came on in the ninth, and allowed a leadoff walk to Yadier Molina, but retired the next three batters in order to end the game and tie the Series at one game apiece.\n\n\n\n![](image)Albert Pujols hit three home runs for the Cardinals in Game 3.\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 16 | 15 | 0\n |\n| Texas | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 13 | 3\n |\n| **WP:** Lance Lynn (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Matt Harrison (0\u20131)**Home runs:**STL: Allen Craig (1), Albert Pujols 3 (3)TEX: Michael Young (1), Nelson Cruz (1)**Attendance:** 51,462Boxscore |\n\n\nAfter a total of just eight runs scored in the first two games in St. Louis, the offense of the two lineups scored a combined 23 runs on a historic night in Arlington in which Albert Pujols had what was described as \"the greatest individual hitting performance in World Series history\".[23]\n\n\nAllen Craig hit a home run in the first to put the Cardinals up 1\u20130. In the fourth after a controversial call at first base by umpire Ron Kulpa on a force play and subsequent single put runners on first and second with one out, David Freese's RBI double made it 2\u20130 Cardinals. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, two runs scored on a throwing error by Mike Napoli before Ryan Theriot's RBI single made it 5\u20130 Cardinals. Starter Matt Harrison was pulled from the game after the inning's second out. In the bottom of the inning, a lead-off home run by Michael Young and, two batters later, a two-run home run by Nelson Cruz, made it 5\u20133 Cardinals. Napoli then singled to knock starter Kyle Lohse out of the game. Napoli moved to third on a groundout and single, but was tagged out at home trying to score on Ian Kinsler's fly out to end the inning.\n\n\nIn the fifth, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs on a single and two walks off of Scott Feldman before Freese's groundout scored a run, then a two-run double by Yadier Molina made the score 8\u20133 Cardinals. In the bottom of the inning, Texas got two leadoff singles off of Fernando Salas before Young drove in a run with a double. Lance Lynn relieved Salas and allowed an RBI single to Adrian Beltre, then, one out later, a sacrifice fly to Napoli to make it 8\u20136 Cardinals.\n\n\nAlbert Pujols, who had been hitless through the first two games, then hit a 423\u00a0ft (129\u00a0m) home run off Alexi Ogando in the sixth inning after a leadoff single and walk to make it 11\u20136 Cardinals. An error, single and walk loaded the bases before Mike Gonzalez relieved Ogando and allowed a sacrifice fly to Molina. Next inning, Pujols's two-run home run after a two-out walk off of Gonzalez made it 14\u20136 Cardinals. The Rangers scored their last run of the game in the bottom of the inning when Beltre hit a leadoff double off of Lynn, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Napoli's sacrifice fly off of Octavio Dotel.\n\n\nThe Cardinals added to their lead in the eighth when Freese singled with one out off of Mark Lowe and pinch-runner Daniel Descalso scored on Molina's double. Then in the ninth, Pujols hit his third home run of the game, giving him six RBIs, off of Darren Oliver. Mitchell Boggs retired Texas in order in the bottom of the ninth as the Cardinals won 16\u20137, leading the Series by 2\u20131.\n\n\nAlbert Pujols joined Babe Ruth (1926, 1928) and Reggie Jackson (1977) as the only players in baseball history up to that time to hit three home runs in a World Series game. (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year.) Pujols was 5-for-6 with two singles, three HRs, four runs scored, and six RBIs. Yadier Molina added two doubles, driving in four runs. David Freese continued his postseason 13-game hitting streak getting two hits (one double), driving in two runs. Pujols became the first player in World Series history[24] to get hits in four consecutive innings: fourth (single), fifth (single), sixth (HR, three RBIs), and seventh (HR, two RBIs). He tied records for most HRs (3), most hits (5), and most RBIs (6) in a World Series game, and established a new record with 14 total bases.[25]\n\n\nThe 16 runs scored by the Cardinals were the most runs scored in a World Series game since 2002, when the San Francisco Giants scored 16 against the Anaheim Angels in Game 5.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mike Napoli hit a home run for the Rangers for the second time in the series.\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 23, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| St. Louis | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0\n |\n| **Texas** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Derek Holland (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Edwin Jackson (0\u20131)**Home runs:**STL: NoneTEX: Mike Napoli (2)**Attendance:** 51,539Boxscore |\n\n\nAfter a high-scoring affair the night before, Derek Holland quieted the Cardinals' bats as he pitched 8+1\u20443 innings of two-hit baseball. Lance Berkman had both of the Cardinals' two hits. Josh Hamilton's first-inning RBI double put the Rangers in front for only the second time in the Series. A three-run home run by Mike Napoli provided Holland a comfortable 4\u20130 lead. The Cardinals managed a small rally in the ninth, but were unable to score against closer Neftal\u00ed Feliz.[26]\n\n\nCoincidentally, this game was one of two major DFW vs. St. Louis sporting events taking place in Arlington on that day, as the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and St. Louis Rams had played at nearby Cowboys Stadium that afternoon; during the opening coin toss, Berkman and Hamilton, in uniform, had each served as honorary captains for their city's team.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mitch Moreland (above) and Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (below) hit solo home runs to tie the game up for the Rangers. ![](image)\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 24, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), mostly clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| St. Louis | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **Texas** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | X | 4 | 9 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Darren Oliver (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Octavio Dotel (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Neftal\u00ed Feliz (2)**Home runs:**STL: NoneTEX: Mitch Moreland (1), Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (1)**Attendance:** 51,459Boxscore |\n\n\nStarters C. J. Wilson and Chris Carpenter faced off again. Wilson walked two batters, Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman, in the second inning and both came in to score, aided in part by an error by David Murphy. However, despite the Rangers walking nine batters in the game (including Albert Pujols three times intentionally), the Cardinals did not score again, leaving 12 runners on base. Mitch Moreland hit a home run in the third, and Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 hit one in the sixth, to tie the score at 2\u20132.\n\n\nThe Rangers' half of the eighth featured a series of bullpen mix-ups by the Cardinals, leaving Tony La Russa without closer Jason Motte in a crucial situation. After Michael Young led off the inning with a double, La Russa sent both Motte (a right-hander) and left-handed reliever Marc Rzepczynski to begin warmups. However, Cardinals bullpen coach Derek Lilliquist later stated that he only heard Rzepczynski's name called. When La Russa saw that Motte was not warming up, he made a second call to the bullpen, but this time Lilliquist thought he heard La Russa call for reliever Lance Lynn, who was supposedly unavailable for the game due to throwing 47 pitches in Game\u00a03.[28]\n\n\nDotel intentionally walked Nelson Cruz, whereupon La Russa summoned Rzepczynski to face the left-handed hitting Murphy. Usually, the Rangers would counter with a right-handed pinch-hitter, such as Craig Gentry or Yorvit Torrealba. However, Murphy stayed in the game, and hit a grounder off Rzepczynski, loading the bases. With Motte not yet available (La Russa thought he was warming up, but he was not yet ready), La Russa was forced to match Rzepczynski against the right-handed hitting Mike Napoli, who hit a two-run double scoring Young and Cruz. After a Moreland strikeout, La Russa called for Motte from the bullpen, only to be surprised to see Lynn coming out (it was then when he learned of the mix-ups). Lynn then was asked to intentionally walk Ian Kinsler, making him only the third pitcher in World Series history to make a relief appearance solely to serve an intentional walk.[28]\n\n\nNeftal\u00ed Feliz came in to save the game in the ninth, his second save of the Series.\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 9 | 15 | 2\n |\n| **St. Louis** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 10 | 13 | 3\n |\n| **WP:** Jake Westbrook (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Mark Lowe (0\u20131)**Home runs:**TEX: Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (2), Nelson Cruz (2), Josh Hamilton (1)STL: Lance Berkman (1), Allen Craig (2), David Freese (1)**Attendance:** 47,325Boxscore |\n\n\nGame\u00a06, moved from October 26 to 27 due to rain and because the stadium was not domed, was a rematch of Game\u00a02's starters: Cardinals lefty Jaime Garc\u00eda and Rangers starter Colby Lewis. Texas jumped on top immediately, with Josh Hamilton driving in Ian Kinsler in the top of the first. The Cardinals responded quickly with a two-run Lance Berkman home run in the bottom half. Kinsler tied the game in the top of the second with a ground-rule double, scoring Craig Gentry. Garc\u00eda was pulled after only three innings (and 59 pitches) and replaced with Fernando Salas. Leading off the top of the fourth, Matt Holliday misplayed a Nelson Cruz pop fly, putting Cruz at second. Mike Napoli singled him home to once again give Texas the lead.\n\n\nThe Cardinals jumped right back in the game, taking advantage of a Michael Young error and scoring on a Yadier Molina groundout to knot the game at three. David Freese started off the top of the fifth by dropping a routine pop fly (the third consecutive half-inning to begin with an error), which immediately turned into the go-ahead run for Texas on Young's double. Colby Lewis was cruising for the Rangers until the bottom of the sixth. After an Albert Pujols strikeout, Berkman singled to third. Matt Holliday grounded into a possible double play which was mishandled at first by Michael Young (his second error of the game), leaving all runners safe. Lewis walked the bases loaded and was pulled for Alexi Ogando, who promptly walked Yadier Molina to force in a run. With the Cardinals in a prime position to rally ahead, Matt Holliday, standing 90 feet (27\u00a0m) away as the possible go-ahead run, was picked off at third by catcher Mike Napoli. Holliday injured his finger sliding in on the play and was forced to leave the game. After Ogando walked Nick Punto, Derek Holland came in to pitch and the Rangers were able to slip out of the inning with the score still tied.\n\n\n\n![](image)Josh Hamilton hit the go ahead two-run home run in the 10th inning for the Rangers.\nLance Lynn came on to pitch for the Cardinals in the top of the seventh and was promptly greeted with back-to-back home runs by Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 and Nelson Cruz to put Texas up by two. Ian Kinsler added his second RBI later in the inning to make the score 7\u20134, Rangers. In the bottom of the eighth, Allen Craig (who entered the game as Holliday's replacement) hit a home run to pull the Cardinals within two. Rangers closer Neftal\u00ed Feliz entered in the bottom of the ninth to deliver the Rangers their first ever World Series Championship. After striking out Ryan Theriot, Feliz faced Albert Pujols. Facing possibly his last at-bat as a Cardinal, Pujols hit Feliz's first pitch into left field for a double. Feliz walked Lance Berkman to put the tying run on first, but got Craig to take a called third strike. The Rangers were one out away from their first-ever World Series championship title as David Freese stepped to the plate. Down to his last strike, Freese hit Feliz's pitch past a leaping Nelson Cruz off the right field wall for a triple, tying the game at seven. (To this day baseball fans debate whether or not Cruz should have been replaced by Endy Chavez and whether or not Cruz could have caught the ball, thereby winning the world series for Texas, had he positioned himself differently, timed his leap differently, or had a better read on the ball.)\n\n\n\n![](image)Lance Berkman, however, hit the tying single in the Cardinals' half of the 10th inning.\n![](image)David Freese, who hit a two-RBI triple that tied the game in the 9th inning for the Cardinals, hit a solo home run in the 11th to stave off elimination for St. Louis.\nSent into extra innings, Jason Motte went out for his second inning of work. Elvis Andrus singled, then the Rangers' MVP candidate Josh Hamilton put Texas up again with a towering two-run home run. Down 9\u20137, and out of bench players, the Cardinals once again faced only three outs until elimination. Left-hander Darren Oliver came in to pitch for the Rangers. St. Louis players Daniel Descalso and Jon Jay hit back-to-back singles, and starting pitcher Kyle Lohse was called to bunt. Lohse's sacrifice bunt put the tying run in scoring position. With right-handers coming up, right-hander Scott Feldman replaced Oliver on the mound. Ryan Theriot's sacrifice groundout scored Descalso, cutting the Rangers' lead to 9\u20138, and following an intentional walk to Pujols, Berkman stepped up to the plate. Feldman got ahead on the count 1\u20132 on a foul ball. Berkman worked the count to 2\u20132, and the Rangers were once again one strike away from their first championship title. Berkman then smacked Feldman's next pitch into center field for a single, scoring Jay and tying the game once again. It was the first time in World Series history that a team came back from two different two-run deficits in the ninth inning or later in the same game.[*citation needed*] The Rangers failed to score in the top of the 11th, bringing David Freese to lead off the bottom of the inning. Freese hit Mark Lowe's 3\u20132 pitch into the grass of the center field batter's eye for a game-winning home run, forcing the World Series to a Game 7 for the first time since 2002.\n\n\nOf the last 13 instances in which a Major League team won a Game 6 at home to force a Game 7 in the postseason, all but two went on to win Game 7. The exceptions were the New York Mets in the 2006 NLCS against, coincidentally, the Cardinals; and the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.[29]\n\n\nFreese's walk-off home run was the fourth that won[30] in a Game\u00a06 in World Series history.[31][32]\n\n\nThe Cardinals set two World Series milestones in their Game 6 win\u2014the first team to come back from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings, and the first team to score in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th innings.[33] On *Mike and Mike in the Morning* the next day, ESPN senior baseball analyst Buster Olney called it the greatest game in the history of baseball.[34]\n\n\nGame 6 was originally scheduled for Wednesday, October 26, but was postponed due to heavy rain in the forecast; this was the first time that a World Series game was postponed since 2006. Although rain was only falling fairly lightly in St. Louis when this decision was made, MLB officials did not want a repeat of Game 5 of the 2008 World Series (which was suspended after the top of the sixth inning and resumed two days later).[22]\n\n\nDavid Freese and Lance Berkman became the third and fourth players[35] in World Series history to get game-tying hits with their team one out from elimination.[36]\n\n\nFreese, who grew up a Cardinal fan in the suburbs of St. Louis, said that as he was circling the bases after his home run, he was thinking about a similar walk-off homer by Jim Edmonds for the Cardinals in Game 6 of the 2004 National League Championship Series in Busch Stadium II. After Freese said he remembered that home run, Lance Berkman, who played for the losing Houston Astros in that series, said \"So do I.\"[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Allen Craig hit the go-ahead home run in the 3rd inning that put the Cardinals ahead for good.\n### Game 7[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 28, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), mostly clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **St. Louis** | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | X | 6 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Chris Carpenter (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Matt Harrison (0\u20132)**Home runs:**TEX: NoneSTL: Allen Craig (3)**Attendance:** 47,399Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore Game\u00a07, the Cardinals replaced Matt Holliday, who sprained his wrist in Game\u00a06, on their roster with Adron Chambers.[38]\n\n![](image)Crowds fill the stadium and parking lots during Game 7Josh Hamilton and Michael Young had RBI doubles in the first inning against Chris Carpenter, who became the first pitcher in a decade[39] to make three starts in one Series thanks to the unnecessary postponement of game 6 due to forecasted rain that did not occur.

The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.[42][43]\n\n\nDavid Freese became the sixth player in history to earn League Championship Series and World Series MVP awards in the same postseason.[44]\n\n\n\nThe Rangers set a Series record by issuing 41 walks, breaking the previous record held by the Florida Marlins when winning the 1997 World Series after issuing 40.[45]\n\n![](image)Cardinals players celebrate after winning their franchise's 11th World Series title.The Cardinals became the first wild card team to win the World Series since the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series (coincidentally, against the Cardinals).\n\n\n## Composite Line Score[edit]\n\n\n2011 World Series **(4\u20133): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)** over Texas Rangers (A.L.)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis Cardinals** | 5 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 38 | 56 | 6\n |\n| Texas Rangers | 4 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 8\n |\n| **Total\u00a0attendance:**\u00a0342,878\u00a0 \u00a0**Average\u00a0attendance:**\u00a048,983**Winning player's share:** $323,169.98\u00a0 \u00a0**Losing player's share:** $251,515.76[46] |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe series was televised in the United States and Canada by Fox. Joe Buck called play-by-play on his 14th World Series for the network, dating back to 1996, while color analyst Tim McCarver handled his 22nd World Series since 1985. Ken Rosenthal served as field reporter for the games, while Chris Rose hosted the pregame and postgame coverage with analysts A. J. Pierzynski and Eric Karros.[47]\n\n\nJoe Buck's call of \"...we will see you tomorrow night!\" on David Freese's walk-off home run echoed his father Jack's call of Kirby Puckett's walk-off home run from Game 6 of the 1991 World Series, occurring 20 years and a day apart from each other, given the similar situations: Game 6, 11th inning, first batter of the final inning, and breaking a 3\u20133 tie to win the game 4\u20133, and extend the series to a 7th game.\n\n\nMLB International syndicated television coverage of the Series (with Gary Thorne and Rick Sutcliffe announcing) to viewers outside of North America.[48]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nThe ratings started off poorly, averaging just 8.4 through its first 5 games (at this time, the record for lowest World Series rating was 8.4, set by five games of the 2008 World Series and five games of the 2010 World Series). Game 3 also produced a 6.6 rating, making it the second lowest World Series rated game of all-time (behind the 6.1 rating in Game 3 of the 2008 World Series and Game 3 of the 2012 World Series).[49]\n\n\nHowever, Games 6 and 7 generated massive ratings that brought the overall average to 9.9. The 14.7 rating for Game\u00a07 was at the time the network's highest for a World Series telecast since Game 4 of the 2004 World Series.[50]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Ratings(households) | Share(households) | American audience(in millions)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 8.7 | 14 | 14.2\n |\n| 2\n | 8.9 | 14 | 14.3\n |\n| 3\n | 6.6 | 12 | 11.2\n |\n| 4\n | 9.2 | 14 | 15.2\n |\n| 5\n | 8.8 | 14 | 14.3\n |\n| 6\n | 12.7 | 21 | 21.1\n |\n| 7\n | 14.7 | 25 | 25.4\n |\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio also broadcast the games nationally. This was the first World Series for play-by play announcer Dan Shulman and analysts Orel Hershiser and Bobby Valentine.[51] ESPN Deportes Radio aired the Series for Spanish language listeners, with Ernesto Jerez and Guillermo Celis announcing.\n\n\nLocally, the two teams' flagship stations broadcast the Series with their respective announcing crews. The Rangers' broadcasts aired on KESN (with Eric Nadel and Steve Busby announcing),[52] while the Cardinals' broadcasts aired on KMOX (with Mike Shannon and John Rooney announcing).[53] Due to contractual obligations, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games, although the local broadcasts were available on XM Satellite Radio and to Gameday Audio subscribers at MLB.com.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Simon Brotherton and Josh Chetwynd called the games for BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.[54]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Russa during the World Series parade.\nThe 2011 World Series was only the second World Series ever in which a team, one strike away from elimination, came back to win\u2014with the Cardinals, in fact, achieving this feat twice in Game\u00a06. The first was the 1986 World Series, in which the New York Mets rallied from a 5\u20133 deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game\u00a06 to win the game and, later, the decisive Game\u00a07.[55][56]\n\n\nThis was the third and final World Series title for Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who initially announced his retirement on October 31, 2011, after 33 seasons as a major league manager.[57] La Russa later came out of retirement and served as manager of the Chicago White Sox in 2021 and 2022. La Russa had previously led the Cardinals (2006) and Oakland Athletics (1989) to World Series championships. Former Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny, who played for the 2004 Cardinals that lost the World Series, was hired to replace him.\n\n\nAfter the New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI during the offseason, some news organizations, among them *The St. Louis Post-Dispatch*, compared the Cardinals to the Giants, invoking Al Michaels's call of the Giants winning the Super Bowl: \"The New York Giants, given the last rites by many in December, are the Super Bowl Champs in February.\"[58]\n\n\nThe Rangers became the first team to lose in the World Series in consecutive years since the Atlanta Braves in 1991 and 1992 and the first American League team to do so since the New York Yankees in 1963 and 1964.\n\n\nAlbert Pujols and C. J. Wilson would later end up signing with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the offseason, in one of the deepest free-agent classes in recent MLB history, while the Rangers obtained the rights to sign Japanese star pitcher Yu Darvish to replace Wilson. In his first press conference as a Ranger, Darvish was asked about Game 6 of the World Series where David Freese hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th, and said \"If it was last year [2011], I would have given up a home run and lost the game. This year [2012] I won't let that happen.\"[59] Pujols returned to the Cardinals in 2022, which was the last season of his career.[60]\n\n\nBoth teams would advance into the postseason again in the following year, both as wild cards. The Rangers lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the inaugural American League Wild Card game, and would not make the postseason again until 2015. The Cardinals won the inaugural National League Wild Card game against Atlanta. They then defeated the Washington Nationals in the NLDS before falling to the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS.\n\n\nSt. Louis would return to the World Series in 2013, continuing the pattern of Giants and Cardinals exchanging pennant victories. However, the Cardinals lost to the Boston Red Sox in six games before losing to San Francisco again in the 2014 NLCS, 4 games to 1.\n\n\nLa Russa would be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.[61]\n\n\nThe Series marked the beginning of a decade in which all current Missouri-based teams in the four major American sports leagues would win a championship. The Kansas City Royals won the 2015 World Series, the St. Louis Blues won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, and the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV following the 2019 season.\n\n\n10 years after the 2011 World Series, Ron Washington would finally win a World Series ring after 44 years in MLB, as he served as the third base coach for the Atlanta Braves. In addition, four players from the 2011 Rangers' World Series team later won a world championship with the Boston Red Sox: Mike Napoli and Koji Uehara in 2013, and Ian Kinsler and Mitch Moreland in 2018.\n\n\n\n> \n> \"May the ghosts of 2011 be forever erased!\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n- Rangers radio announcer Eric Nadel, after the Rangers won the 2023 World Series\n\nThe Rangers would return to the World Series again in 2023 where they would finally win it all as they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4 games to 1 to clinch their first title in franchise history. Pitching coach Mike Maddux was on the coaching staff for all of Texas' World Series appearances, having served under Washington for the first two before he was rehired under Bruce Bochy during the third.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 Asia Series\n* 2011 Japan Series\n* 2011 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2011 World Series\". *Baseball-Reference*.

The team previously played at Tim McCarver Stadium in 1998 and 1999.\n\n\nThe Redbirds were established as an expansion team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998. In conjunction with Major League Baseball's reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022.

Combining all 3,617\u00a0regular season and postseason games, Memphis has an all-time record of 1,818\u20131,799 (.503).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Prior professional baseball in Memphis[edit]\n\n\n![Seventeen baseball players wearing light uniforms with dark vertical pinstripes standing with their arms crossed.](image)The 1921 Memphis Chicks, champions of the Southern Association\nThe first professional baseball team in Memphis was the Memphis Reds of the League Alliance in 1877.[5] A different Reds team was created as a charter member of the original Southern League in 1885.[5] The city's Southern League team was known as the Grays in 1886 and 1888, the Browns in 1887, simply Memphis in 1889, the Giants in 1892 and 1894, the Fever Germs in 1893, and the Lambs/Giants in 1895.[5]\n\n\nThe city's longest-operating baseball team, first known as Memphis Egyptians, was formed in 1901 as a charter member of the Southern Association.[5] From 1909 to 1911, this club was called the Turtles before receiving its best-known moniker, the Chickasaws, often shortened to Chicks, in 1912.[5] The original Chicks remained in the league through 1960, winning eight pennants, one playoff championship, and one Dixie Series title. Russwood Park, their home ballpark, was destroyed by fire in April 1960. With the cost of building a new facility too high, the team dropped out of the league after the 1960 season.[6]\n\n\nAfter a seven-year span with no professional team, Memphis became host to the Memphis Blues, a Double-A team of the Texas League, in 1968.[5] After six seasons, the Blues moved up to the Triple-A International League in 1974, but the franchise was revoked by the league due to financial problems after the 1976 season.[5][7] Memphis gained an expansion team in the Double-A Southern League that played from 1978 to 1997.[5] The Chicks were relocated to nearby Jackson as the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx in 1998 to make way for a new Triple-A team.[8]\n\n\n\n### Pacific Coast League (1998\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\nThe Memphis Redbirds were created as an expansion franchise of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998.[9] Initially, the team was owned as a non-profit community entity called the Memphis Redbirds Baseball Foundation, which operated the Redbirds until 2009 when management was turned over to Global Spectrum, a Comcast-owned company.[10][11] While a new ballpark, AutoZone Park, was being constructed for the team, they played their first two seasons (1998\u201399) at the city's Tim McCarver Stadium.[12]\n\n\nThe Redbirds became the top minor league affiliate of the Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals. Memphis' team name, logo, color scheme, and uniforms were all based on those of the St. Louis team. In their inaugural season, the club was managed by Gaylen Pitts. The Redbirds played their first game on the road at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. In game one of the doubleheader, the Omaha Royals defeated the Redbirds, 3\u20132.[13] The team finished their first season of play with a 74\u201370 record, three games out of first place, leaving them second out of four teams in their division.[14] They finished the 1999 season in third place with a 74\u201364 record.[15]\n\n\nIn 2000, Memphis moved into the newly constructed AutoZone Park.[16] In the park's first regular season game, held on April 14, the Redbirds defeated the Iowa Cubs, 14\u20133.[17] Memphis went on to clinch the Pacific Coast League's American Conference East Division championship by ending the season in first place, 131\u20442 games ahead of the second-place Oklahoma RedHawks.[18] In the American Conference series, the Redbirds defeated the Albuquerque Isotopes, three games to two, and advanced to the league finals.[19] Memphis then defeated the Salt Lake Buzz, 3\u20131, to win the PCL championship.[19] The Redbirds went on to face the Indianapolis Indians, league champions of the Triple-A International League, in the best-of-five Triple-A World Series. Memphis lost, three games to one.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nick Stavinoha, with the Redbirds from 2007 to 2011, is the team's all-time leader in games played (479), RBI (316), doubles (96), hits (531), and home runs (74).[21]\nThe team finished each of the next three seasons in fourth place\u20142001 (62\u201381),[22] 2002 (71\u201371),[23] and 2003 (64\u201379).[24] The 2002 campaign was a particularly tight race within the American Conference East Division, as the fourth-place Redbirds were a mere three games behind first-place Oklahoma.[23] Tom Spencer became manager of the Redbirds in 2013 but was replaced midseason by Danny Sheaffer. Memphis hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game at AutoZone Park in 2003.[25] Players Jason Bowers, Matt Duff, and Jason Ryan represented Memphis, as they were elected to the PCL All-Star Team.[26]\n\n\nPitcher Dan Haren was selected for the 2004 PCL All-Star Team and was chosen as the PCL Star of the Game\u2014the most valuable player representing the league.[25] Memphis ended the 2004 season in second place, eight games behind first-place Oklahoma, with a 73\u201371 record.[27] The team finished third (71\u201372) in 2005, 3+1\u20442 games behind the eventual league champion Nashville Sounds.[28] From 2006 to 2007, Memphis finished further out of first place with records of 58\u201386 in 2006 and 56\u201388 in 2007.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2008 season began a reversal of the team's fortunes. Though winding up in second place in 2008, the team, under second-year manager Chris Maloney, managed a second-place finish with their 75\u201367 record.[31] In 2009, the Redbirds' first-place finish (77\u201367) earned them the American Conference North Division title and a return to the postseason for the first time in nine seasons.[32] In the American Conference series, Memphis faced the Albuquerque Isotopes, sweeping them in three-straight games.[32] They continued to also defeat the Sacramento River Cats, 3\u20130, in the finals to win their second PCL championship.[32] They then competed against the International League's Durham Bulls in the Bricktown Showdown for the Triple-A National Championship, but were defeated in the single game, 5\u20134.[33]\n\n\nHaving finished the 2010 season in a tie for first place with the Iowa Cubs (82\u201362), Memphis was awarded the American Conference North title by virtue of having won the regular season series against Iowa.[34] Memphis started the postseason by defeating the Oklahoma City RedHawks, 3\u20130, to win the American Conference championship.[34] The Tacoma Rainiers then swept the Redbirds, defeating them for the PCL crown in three-straight games.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)P. J. Walters, a Redbird from 2008 to 2011, is the team's all-time leader in wins (32), strikeouts (428), and games started (78).[35]\nThe 2011, the club narrowly missed the postseason, finishing second with a 77\u201366 record.[36] In 2012, manager Chris Maloney, the longest-tenured skipper in team history, was hired as St. Louis' first base coach.[37] He was replaced by Ron Warner.[38] He led the Redbirds to finish in third place (57\u201387) and 27 games out of first.[39] The team fared better in 2013, ending up in second place (69\u201375), just one game behind the eventual league champion Omaha Storm Chasers.[40]\n\n\nIn March 2014, the Redbirds were purchased by their major league parent club, the St. Louis Cardinals.[11] The transaction also included the City of Memphis acquiring AutoZone Park and then leasing it to the team.[11] Ron Warner led his club to a first-place finish (79\u201364), clinching the American Conference South.[41] They were defeated in the conference series, three games to one, by Omaha, who later won the PCL title.[41] The 2015 club, under manager Mike Shildt, finished in second place (73\u201371), two games behind the Round Rock Express.[42]\n\n\nThe Cardinals sold their majority interest in the team to Peter B. Freund of Trinity Baseball Holdings in March 2016.[3][43] Memphis ended the 2016 season in fourth place with a 65\u201377 record.[44] Prior to the 2017 season, the Redbirds unveiled new logos and uniforms. The primary logo is designed to look like a neon sign, such as those seen on nearby Beale Street, consisting of the team name and a redesigned image of team mascot, Rockey the Redbird. A secondary logo uses similar neon tubing to form an \"M\" in the shape of a music note to honor the city's blues and rock 'n' roll heritage.[45] Led by PCL Manager of the Year Stubby Clapp,[46] the 2017 Redbirds clinched the division title with a 91\u201350 record.[47] They went on to defeat the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3\u20132, to win the American Conference championship.[48] In the PCL finals, the Redbirds defeated the El Paso Chihuahuas, 3\u20132, to win their third PCL championship.[48] Memphis lost the Triple-A National Championship Game, 5\u20133, against the International League's Durham Bulls, whom they also faced in 2009.[49]\n\n\nStubby Clapp won the PCL Manager of the Year Award for a second time in 2018.[50] Right-hander Dakota Hudson won the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award.[51] The team once again finished with the league's best record, winning the 2018 American Southern Division title with an 83\u201357 record.[52] They defeated the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to one, to win the American Conference championship.[53] The Redbirds won their second PCL championship in as many years by beating the Fresno Grizzlies, 3\u20131.[53] They went on to win the 2018 Triple-A National Championship against the Durham Bulls, 14\u20134. First baseman Alex Mejia was named the game's MVP.[54]\n\n\nMemphis finished the 2019 season in second place with a 69\u201371 record under manager Ben Johnson.[55]\n\n\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.[56][57]\n\n\n\n### Triple-A East / International League (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Masyn Winn won the 2023 International League Top MLB Prospect Award.\nFollowing the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. As a result, the Pacific Coast League was disbanded, and the Redbirds were placed in the Triple-A East, where they continued to serve as the top farm club for the St. Louis Cardinals.[58] Memphis began competition in the new league on May 4 with a 7\u20135 loss to the Durham Bulls at AutoZone Park.[59] They lost the next four games before collecting their first Triple-A East win with a 7\u20136 victory in 10\u00a0innings over Durham on May 9.[60] Memphis ended the season in fifth place in the Southeastern Division with a 57\u201363 record.[61] No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner.[62] Memphis placed 12th in the league standings.[61] However, 10\u00a0games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage.[62] Memphis finished the tournament tied for 13th place with a 4\u20134 record.[63]\n\n\nPrior to the 2022 season, the Redbirds were sold to Diamond Baseball Holdings, a group which operates other affiliated Minor League Baseball teams and is led by Pat Battle and former team owner Peter B. Freund.[2] In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League (IL), the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.[64] Memphis began IL play with an Opening Night win against the Gwinnett Stripers, 2\u20131, at AutoZone Park on April 5.[65] They ended the season in sixth place in the Western Division at 73\u201377.[66] Playing under a split-season format in 2023 in which the teams with the best league-wide records at the end of each half qualified for the playoffs,[67] Memphis missed the first-half title by nine-and-a-half games, placing eighth at 39\u201336.[68] They dropped further back in the second half, placing 17th at 32\u201342, fifteen-and-a-half games back.[69] Overall, the team went 71\u201378.[70] Luken Baker won the International League Most Valuable Player Award and Masyn Winn was chosen for the IL Top MLB Prospect Award.[71]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Memphis Redbirds seasons\n\n\n\nMemphis Redbirds records (last five seasons)\n| Season\n | Regular season\n | Postseason\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Record\n | Win\u00a0%\n | League\n | Division\n | GB | Record\n | Win\u00a0%\n | Result\n |\n| 2019\n | 69\u201371 | .493 | 8th | 2nd | 6 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [55] |\n| 2020\n | *Season cancelled (COVID-19 pandemic)* | [57] |\n| 2021\n | 57\u201363 | .475 | 12th | 5th | 20 | 4\u20134 | .500 | Lost series vs. Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, 4\u20131*Won series vs. Charlotte Knights, 3\u20130*Placed 13th (tie) in the Triple-A Final Stretch[63] | [61] |\n| 2022\n | 73\u201377\n | .487\n | 13th | 6th | 18+1\u20442 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [66] |\n| 2023\n | 71\u201378\n | .477\n | 11th | 5th | 13+1\u20442 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [72] |\n| **Totals** | 270\u2013289 | .483 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 4\u20134 | .500 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Rivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Redbirds\u2013Sounds rivalry\n\nMemphis' chief rivals have been those based in Nashville. Located approximately 200 miles (320\u00a0km) to the northeast and connected to Memphis by Interstate 40, Nashville has fielded several teams which have competed in the same leagues as Memphis' teams since the late 19th century.[73] The Redbirds entered the rivalry when they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998.[14] The teams have been division rivals ever since.[74] In 2009, Memphis clinched the American Conference North Division title, finishing the season just two games ahead of Nashville, which spent the majority of the season in first place.[32] Similarly, Memphis finished the 2014 season two-and-a-half games ahead of Nashville despite trailing the Sounds for most of the season.[41] In 2021, both teams were placed in the Southeast Division of the Triple-A East.[58] This became the International League in 2022,[64] and both clubs were realigned into its West Division.[75] As of the completion of the 2023 head-to-head series, the Sounds lead the 26-year rivalry against the Redbirds with a record of 220\u2013186 in 405\u00a0meetings.[76]\n\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, the two teams competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game promotional series between the clubs.[77] Whichever of the two won the most games played between them was declared the winner and got to keep the trophy cup until the next season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9\u20137), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7\u20139).[77] The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8\u20138), but the Redbirds retained the title in both instances.[78] The teams discontinued the promotion after the 2015 season.\n\n\n\n## Ballparks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memphis' AutoZone Park\n### Tim McCarver Stadium (1998\u20131999)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tim McCarver Stadium\n\nThe Redbirds played their first two seasons at Tim McCarver Stadium while a new, permanent stadium was being constructed downtown. The stadium was built in 1963 for use as an American Legion field. When the Texas League's Memphis Blues came to town in 1968, it became their home ballpark. It was later used by the Memphis Chicks until 1997. The stadium, with an 8,800 person capacity, was demolished in 2005.\n\n\n\n### AutoZone Park (2000\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: AutoZone Park\n\nThe Redbirds' current home ballpark is AutoZone Park, which opened on April 1, 2000, originally seated 16,000 and was later downsized in 2015 to the current seating capacity of 10,000 people. The reduced seating due to $6 million in renovations allowed for picnic tables, seating in grassy areas, and the elimination of the popular left field bluff seating. It was constructed in downtown Memphis at a cost of $80.5 million.[79] It was built to Major League Baseball standards, but with the absence of outfield seats or food vendors far down the foul lines. The first game played at the park was an exhibition between Memphis and St. Louis. A standing-room-only crowd witnessed the big league club defeat their Triple-A affiliate, 10\u20136.[17]\n\n\n\n## Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jack Flaherty pitching in the Redbirds' road uniform (2018)\nThe Redbirds' current home jerseys are white with the word \"Memphis\" written across the chest in red and white characters surrounded by navy blue and neon yellow which resemble a neon sign. The team's primary logo is sewn on the right sleeve, and the St. Louis Cardinals' overlapping \"STL\" logo is located on the left sleeve. The home cap is solid red with the face of team mascot, Rockey the Redbird, on the front. Road jerseys, though made of gray material, are identical.[80]\n\n\nAn alternate jersey is a power blue pullover v-neck reminiscent of those worn by St. Louis in the 1980s. Striped bands of red, white, and blue adorn the neck and sleeve openings. The front features an image of Rockey the Redbird looking over his shoulder, ball in hand, as if waiting to pitch the ball, on the left chest (this is an homage to a classic St. Louis Cardinals logo, used in the 1950s, sometimes known as the \"Dirty Bird\").[80] The primary Memphis logo is displayed on the left sleeve, and the STL lettering is displayed on the right. An alternate cap is navy blue with a red bill and the music note styled \"M\" on the front.[80]\n\n\nMemphis' uniforms from 1998 to 2016 were quite similar to those of the St. Louis Cardinals. Home uniforms consisted of white jerseys with the team's primary logo sewn across the chest: the word \"Memphis\" in red letters surrounded by navy blue set against a yellow baseball bat on which two red cardinals were perched. The player's number was displayed on the front left below the Memphis wordmark in red block characters bordered by navy blue. The upper left sleeve had a circular navy blue patch with the St. Louis Cardinals' overlapping \"STL\" logo on the center in red letters bordered by white. The player's last name was sewn on the back in red block characters surrounded by navy blue, and his number was displayed below his name in the same font and colors. White pants were worn with red belts and predominately red shoes. Some players wore higher pants paired with red socks with white and navy blue stripes. The home cap was solid red with a white \"M\" bordered by navy blue on the center.[81] Road uniforms were identical to those worn for home games with only a few exceptions: jerseys and pants were made from gray material, the St. Louis patch was absent from the sleeve, and the cap was navy blue with a red button and a red \"M\" with white border.[82]\n\n\n\n## Television and radio[edit]\n\n\nAll Memphis Redbirds games are televised live on MiLB.TV.[83] Jack Keffer is the team's lead broadcaster.[84] Steve Selby was the voice of the Redbirds from 2000 until before the 2021 season, when he retired.[85] Evan Stockton followed Selby as the lead broadcaster in 2021.[86] Past broadcast commentators have included Tom Stocker, David Kelly, Charlie Lea, and Reggie Williams. Since 2018, a select number of games are also broadcast on KTRS 550 AM in St. Louis, allowing Cardinals fans to keep tabs on up-and-coming players as well as promoting the Redbirds and Memphis tourism to the St. Louis market.[87]\n\n\n\n## Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rockey the Redbird, the team mascot\nThe Memphis Redbirds' mascot is an anthropomorphic cardinal named Rockey the Redbird. He is bright red with black eyebrows and feathers around the face and a yellow beak and legs. He wears the same style jerseys as the team bearing the number 901, which is Memphis' telephone area code. He made his debut in the Redbirds' inaugural 1998 season.[88]\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMemphis Redbirds roster* v\n* t\n* e\n\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 37 Jacob Bosiokovic\n* 22 Gordon Graceffo\n* 30 Andre Granillo\n* 50 Kolton Ingram \\*\n* 11 Adam Kloffenstein \\*\n* 75 Brandon Komar\n* 57 Ryan Loutos \\*\n* 29 Michael McGreevy\n* 46 Packy Naughton\n* 66 Nick Raquet\n* 12 Sem Robberse \\*\n* 46 Wilking Rodr\u00edguez ![](image)\n* 70 Victor Santos\n* 19 Connor Thomas\n* 26 Zack Thompson \\*\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 35 Gavin Collins\n* 47 Nick Raposo\n* 51 Wade Stauss\n\n**Infielders**\n* 44 Luken Baker \\*\n* 21 Nick Dunn\n* 28 Arqu\u00edmedes Gamboa\n* 13 C\u00e9sar Prieto\n* 15 Alfonso Rivas III\n* 43 Thomas Saggese\n* 32 Jared Young\n\n**Outfielders**\n* 31 Mois\u00e9s G\u00f3mez ![](image)\n* 7 Matt Koperniak\n* 5 Victor Scott II \\*\n* 38 Jordan Walker \\*\n\n\n |  | **Manager**\n* 34 Ben Johnson\n\n**Coaches**\n* 56 Howie Clark (hitting)\n* 48 Will Hawks\n* 36 Darwin Marrero (pitching)\n\n\n![](image) 7-day injured list\n\\* On St. Louis Cardinals 40-man roster\n~ Development list\n# Rehab assignment\n\u221e Reserve list\n\u2021 Restricted list\n\u00a7 Suspended list\n\u2020 Temporarily inactive list\nRoster updated June 11, 2024\n\n\nTransactions\n\u2192 More rosters: MiLB\u00a0\u2022\u00a0International League\n\u2192 St. Louis Cardinals minor league players\n |\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nSix individuals have won league awards in recognition of their performance while with the Redbirds. Stubby Clapp won the PCL Manager of the Year Award in 2017 and 2018.[89] Dakota Hudson was selected for the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award in 2018.[89] Luken Baker won the IL Most Valuable Player Award in 2023.[71] Masyn Winn won the IL Top MLB Prospect Award in 2023.[71] Additionally, two members of the front office staff have won the PCL Executive of the Year Award: Allie Prescott (2000) and Ben Weiss (2012).[89]\n\n\nThirty-seven players have been selected for the midseason Triple-A All-Star Game.[90] Of those players, only Brandon Dickson (2010 and 2012) and Ryan Sherriff (2016 and 2017) have been selected twice while playing for Memphis.[90] Two players have been chosen as the All-Star Game's MVP: Dan Haren (2004) and Michael Wacha (2013).[91]\n\n\n\n### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nThe Memphis Redbirds have not honored any of their players by retiring their uniform numbers. However, the St. Louis Cardinals' retired numbers are also retired throughout the Cardinals' minor league organization. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. The following numbers are, therefore, also retired by Memphis:[92]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| OzzieSmithSSRetired 1996 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| RedSchoendienst2B, Mgr, CoachRetired 1996 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| StanMusialOF, 1B, GMRetired 1963 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| EnosSlaughterRFRetired 1996 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| TonyLa RussaMgrRetired 2012 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| KenBoyer3B, Mgr, CoachRetired 1984 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| DizzyDeanSPRetired 1974 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| LouBrockLF, CoachRetired 1979 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| TedSimmonsCRetired 2021 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| WhiteyHerzogMgr, GMRetired 2010 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| BruceSutterRPRetired 2006 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| JackieRobinson2BRetired by MLB 1997 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| BobGibsonSP, CoachRetired 1975 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| GussieBuschOwnerRetired 1984 |\n\n |\n\n\n## Managers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stubby Clapp, Redbirds manager from 2017 to 2018\nOver the course of 24 seasons, the Memphis Redbirds have employed 8\u00a0managers. The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[93] Three managers have guided the team to win the Pacific Coast League championship: Gaylen Pitts (2000), Chris Maloney (2009), and Stubby Clapp (2017 and 2018).[94] Clapp also led Memphis to the Triple-A championship in 2018. Maloney is the longest-tenured manager in team history, having managed the team for 717\u00a0games from 2007 to 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\nMemphis Redbirds managerial record\n| No. | Manager\n | Season(s)\n | Regular season\n | Postseason\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Games\n | Wins\n | Losses\n | Win\u00a0%\n | Apps. | Wins\n | Losses\n | Win\u00a0%\n |\n| 1\n | Gaylen Pitts | 1998\u20132002 | 711 | 364 | 347 | .512 | 1 | 7 | 6 | .538 | [95] |\n| 2\n | Tom Spencer | 2003 | 64 | 22 | 42 | .344 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [96] |\n| 3\n | Danny Sheaffer | 2003\u20132006 | 510 | 244 | 266 | .478 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [97] |\n| 4\n | Chris Maloney | 2007\u20132011 | 717 | 367 | 350 | .512 | 2 | 9 | 4 | .692 | [98] |\n| 5\n | Ron Warner | 2012\u20132014 | 431 | 205 | 226 | .476 | 1 | 1 | 3 | .250 | [99] |\n| 6\n | Mike Shildt | 2015\u20132016 | 286 | 138 | 148 | .483 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [100] |\n| 7\n | Stubby Clapp | 2017\u20132018 | 281 | 174 | 107 | .619 | 2 | 13 | 7 | .650 | [101] |\n| 8\n | Ben Johnson | 2019\u2013present | 559 | 270 | 289 | .483 | 1 | 4 | 4 | .500 | [102] |\n| **Totals** | 1998\u20132023 | 3,559 | 1,784 | 1,775 | .501 | 7 | 34 | 24 | .586 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2017 Rebranding\" (PDF). *2019 Memphis Redbirds Media Guide*.

They compete as a member of the Texas League's North Division. The Cardinals began play in 2005.\n\n\nThe team is owned by the 11-time Major League Baseball (MLB) World Champion St. Louis Cardinals, for which it has been the Double-A affiliate since its founding in 2005. Since its inception, the team's home venue has been Hammons Field.\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals won three Texas League North 1st Half Division titles, two Texas League North 2nd Half Division titles, two Texas League North championships and one Texas League championship (2012). Through the 2020 season, a total of 114 former Springfield Cardinals have gone on to make their Major League debut with St. Louis with an additional 27 others debuting with different MLB teams.[2]\n\n\nPreviously, the St. Louis Cardinals' Double-A affiliate was the Tennessee Smokies, located near Sevierville, Tennessee. The Springfield Cardinals' Texas League North rivals are the Arkansas Travelers (Seattle Mariners), Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Kansas City Royals), Tulsa Drillers (Los Angeles Dodgers), and Wichita Wind Surge (Minnesota Twins).\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the Springfield Cardinals were sold by their MLB affiliate, the St. Louis Cardinals, to Diamond Baseball Holdings.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## The original Springfield Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nSpringfield, Missouri, has hosted professional baseball teams since as early as 1905, when the Springfield Highlanders began play. For nearly 30 years, the team was variously called the Highlanders, Jobbers, Midgets, and Merchants. There were several years when no team existed at all.\n\n\nIn 1931, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased a minor league team, renamed it the Cardinals, and relocated it in Springfield. That year, the team won the first of several Western Association titles. With a front office led by future Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, Springfield also went to the playoffs in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1941, and won league titles in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, and 1939.\n\n\nFollowing the 1946 season, St. Louis moved the team to St. Joseph, Missouri, where it remained until 1953. The city of Springfield saw a brief re-emergence of minor league baseball when the rival Chicago Cubs moved its affiliate to Springfield for one season taking the name Springfield Cubs.\n\n\nThough there was a gap of 63 years, most in the Springfield and St. Louis organizations consider the current Cardinals the same group which existed in 1932. Many pieces of fan apparel actually say \"Springfield Cardinals circa 1932.\" The deck on top of the Cardinals dugout also has the championship banners from the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Previous franchise history[edit]\n\n\nThe current Cardinals are a relatively new team, dating back to just 2005. Previous to this, they were known as the El Paso Diablos. That team's owners sold the franchise to the St. Louis Cardinals and were then moved to Springfield as part of their minor league system.\n\n\nThe previous Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals was the Tennessee Smokies in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\nSpringfield has also been the home of various other non-affiliated minor league clubs including the Springfield Highlander (1905), Jobbers (1911), Merchants (1920), Springfield Midgets (1906-1909, 1921\u20131929; the 1930 club being affiliated with the St. Louis Browns) and the Red Wings (1931). These former teams were generally Class C ball clubs in the former Western Association.[4]\n\n\n\n## 2012 season[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 most successful season has been the 2012 campaign, during which they finished first in the North Division in second half of the season, posted a division-best and franchise mark with a 77\u201361 record, and won the Texas League Championship. They went on to defeat the Tulsa Drillers 3\u20132 in the best-of-five divisional playoff series, advancing to the 2012 Texas League Championship Series, their second in franchise history. Springfield defeated the Frisco RoughRiders three games to one in the best-of-five Championship Series. Key players included Kolten Wong, Jermaine Curtis, Carlos Martinez, Trevor Rosenthal, Vance Albitz, Oscar Taveras, and Xavier Scruggs.\n\n\n\n## Hammons Field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hammons Field in Springfield, Missouri\nThe Springfield Cardinals play at Hammons Field.[5] It is located in Springfield, Missouri, and has a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals have two mascots. Their first and main mascot is a brightly colored red bird named Louie. He has been a mascot for the team since its formation in 2005. He is the \"little brother\" of Fredbird, the mascot of the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals. Their second mascot is a fluffy dog named Fetch. He is a fluffy beagle received by Louie as a birthday gift on Opening Day in 2006. During home games they can be found entertaining fans by tossing t-shirts and taking photos. When the team is on the road, Louie and Fetch attend local events in the community.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSpringfield Cardinals roster* v\n* t\n* e\n\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 36 Trent Baker\n* 32 Ian Bedell\n* 49 Alex Cornwell\n* 39 Giovanny Gallegos \\* #\n* 16 Benito Garcia\n* 7 Tink Hence\n* 15 Cooper Hjerpe\n* 46 Andrew Marrero\n* 40 Steven Matz \\* #\n* 39 Keynan Middleton \\* #\n* 43 Edwin Nu\u00f1ez\n* 44 Wilfredo Pereira\n* 38 Max Rajcic\n* 35 Jack Ralston\n* 18 Tekoah Roby ![](image)\n* 31 Ryan Shreve\n* 34 Matt Svanson\n* 30 Leonardo Taveras\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 33 Jimmy Crooks\n* 11 Aaron McKeithan\n* 25 Luis Rodriguez\n\n**Infielders**\n* 5 Jacob Buchberger\n* 29 Matt Lloyd\n* 48 Ramon Mendoza\n* 22 Chandler Redmond\n* 8 Jeremy Rivas\n* 21 Bryan Torres\n* 4 R.J.

Stan Musial played 87 games for Springfield during the 1941 season, batting .379 and quickly becoming a fan favorite. In April 2005, Musial threw out the ceremonial first pitch and played his harmonica to the tune of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" to a crowd of nearly 12,000 during the inaugural St. Louis vs. Springfield Cardinals game.\n\n\nAmong other players to come through Springfield are Dizzy Dean and his brother Paul, Pepper Martin, and Joe Medwick.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rice, Melissa (June 20, 2017). \"Gifford Promoted To St. Louis, Reiter Named New Springfield GM\". *Osarks First*.

The team was established in 1983 as the **Peoria Suns**. They are located in Peoria, Illinois, and are named for the Peoria Indian tribe for which the city was named. In 2005, the team replaced the indigenous imagery associated with the Chiefs name and moved to a logo of a dalmatian depicted as a fire chief.[1] The Chiefs play their home games at Dozer Park, which opened in 2002. They previously played at Vonachen Stadium near Bradley University from 1983 through 2001. The Chiefs have made the playoffs a total of 13 times, through eight wild-card berths, three first-half titles, and two second-half titles.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Earlier professional baseball in Peoria[edit]\n\n\nThe history of professional baseball in Peoria dates to the late 19th century. The Peoria Reds, Peoria Canaries, and Peoria Blackbirds played in several early leagues during parts of 1878 to 1895. The first ballpark used by these teams was reportedly called **Sylvan Park** and was located at the corner of Northeast Glendale Avenue and Spring Street on the location of the present-day St. Augustine Manor.[2] In 1883, the club moved a few blocks toward Peoria Lake, to a facility called **Lake View Park**, on the southeast corner of Northeast Adams Street and Grant Street, which would remain the home of various Peoria clubs for the next four decades.\n\n\nThe 1895, club was dubbed the Peoria Distillers, referencing the Hiram Walker plant. From 1891 to 1911, Frank E. Murphy from Green Bay, Wisconsin, became involved with baseball, beginning with the purchase of the Peoria team of the Midwest League, which he later renamed the Peoria Hoosiers. That nickname would stick with the various Peoria clubs for the next couple of decades, including their first stretch with the Three-I League from 1905 to 1917. After the resumption of following the peak of American involvement in World War I, the Peoria Tractors name gained favor in 1919, with the growth of the nearby branch of the company later called Caterpillar Inc.\n\n\nIn 1923, the team opened a new ballpark called **Woodruff Field** in honor of a long-time mayor of Peoria. The new park was just across Grant Street from Lake View Park. The Tractors continued to play in several leagues before folding after the 1937 season. The city was then without professional baseball for the next 15 years. The name Peoria Chiefs first appeared with a new franchise in the Three-I League in 1953. This club disbanded after 1957, and Peoria was again without professional ball, for the next 25 years until the current Chiefs set up shop. The Woodruff Field site is now a softball facility called Woodruff Park.\n\n\n\n### Current franchise[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chiefs in action in 1990\nThe Peoria Suns were established in 1983. They played their home games at Meinen Field, built in 1968, near the Bradley University campus. The team's name was changed to the Chiefs in 1984. The 1984 team was managed by future Major League Baseball manager Joe Maddon.\n\n\nThe 1988 team, managed by future major league manager Jim Tracy, was the subject of Joseph Bosco's book *The Boys Who Would Be Cubs*.[3]\n\n\nMeinen Field was renovated before the 1992 season and renamed Vonachen Stadium in honor of Chiefs owner Pete Vonachen. The team moved to Dozer Park in downtown Peoria on May 24, 2002. During the new park's first year, the team set a franchise attendance record of 254,407\u00a0and won the Midwest League championship.\n\n\nFormer Cubs catcher Jody Davis managed the 2006 team. \n\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg was hired to manage the 2007 Chiefs, which went 71\u201368 and finished the second half 40\u201330 in a tie for the division title, but missed the playoff on a tiebreaker. The team set a new season attendance record of 259,794, an average of 3,800 per game. Sandberg returned to manage the Chiefs in 2008. The team set a Midwest League single-game attendance record on July 29, 2008, when the Chiefs drew a crowd of 32,103 to Wrigley Field in Chicago for a game against the Kane County Cougars.\n\n\nThe Chiefs' affiliation with the Cubs ended after the 2012 season,[4] and they entered into a player-development contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.[5]\n\n\nUnder Major League Baseball's restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Chiefs were organized into the High-A Central.[6] In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name used by the regional circuit before the 2021 reorganization.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2008 brawl[edit]\n\n\nDuring a game on July 23, 2008, Dayton Dragons hit three Chiefs batters. The teams played again the following day, and in the first inning, Chiefs pitcher Julio Castillo hit Dragons batter Zack Cozart in the head. Two batters later, Castillo hit Angel Cabrera in the arm, and nearly hit another Dragon player in the head after that. Cabrera then spiked the Chiefs shortstop at second base on a slide. At that point, Chiefs fill-in manager Carmelo Martinez began arguing with the umpire. This brought out the Dragons manager, Donnie Scott, and the two argued for a few minutes before the umpires broke it up.\n\n\nDuring the coaches' argument, pitcher Castillo fired a ball at the Dragons' dugout. The ball struck a fan, who was taken to the hospital. Brandon Menchaca proceeded to tackle Castillo from behind as both benches cleared, delaying the game for 69\u00a0minutes. After the game, Castillo was arrested for felonious assault.[8] The injured fan, Chris McCarthy, suffered a concussion but recovered.\n\n\nOn August 8, 2009, Castillo was convicted of felonious assault causing serious physical injury and was sentenced to 30 days in jail.[9] In April 2010, a judge released Castillo from probation \"on the condition that he leave the United States and not return for a minimum of three years.\"[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | League\n | Division\n | Finish[d] | Wins[d] | Losses[d] | Win%\n | GB[e] | Postseason\n |

They are located in State College, Pennsylvania, and play their home games at Medlar Field on the campus of Pennsylvania State University.\n\n\nThe team was founded in 1958 in Auburn, New York, as an affiliate of the New York Yankees. Through its first two decades, the team's affiliation passed through the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, and Philadelphia Phillies. In 1978, however, the team was left without a Major League Baseball (MLB) parent club. Auburn fielded independent teams in the New York\u2013Penn League\u2014with new nicknames each year\u2014until 1980. Erie-area businessmen Dave Masi and Joe Castelli propped up the franchise for the 1980 season, then moved it to Erie, as the Erie Cardinals, reflecting the new affiliation with the St. Louis Cardinals. That affiliation lasted for 25 years, with three further relocations\u2014to Hamilton, Ontario as the Hamilton Redbirds, Glens Falls, New York as the Glens Falls Redbirds and to Augusta, New Jersey as the New Jersey Cardinals.\n\n\nThe team settled in its current location in the State College area in 2006 and became known as the State College Spikes. After one season with the St. Louis Cardinals in State College, the Spikes ended their affiliation and became the new Class A Short Season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, starting in 2007 and ending in 2012. The Spikes, once again, switched affiliations back to the Cardinals from 2013 to 2020. In conjunction with MLB's reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, the team left Minor League Baseball and became part of the MLB Draft League, which serves as a showcase for draft-eligible players.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Stability, then instability in Auburn (1958\u20131980)[edit]\n\n\nThe State College Spikes were founded in 1958 in Auburn, New York as the Auburn Yankees. The team played its home games at Falcon Park in Auburn from 1958 to 1980. For two decades, affiliated baseball was a mainstay in Auburn. After the Yankees, the Mets, Twins and Phillies all had affiliation agreements with the team. In 1978, however, the team did not have an agreement in place. Auburn fielded an independent team known as the Auburn Sunsets. Unaffiliated baseball remained in Auburn for the following two seasons, as well. The team changed its name to the Auburn Red Stars in 1979 and Auburn Americans in 1980. Erie-area businessmen Dave Masi and Joe Castelli propped up the Americans, then reached an affiliation agreement with the St. Louis Cardinals during baseball's winter meetings. They moved the team to Erie for the 1981 season.\n\n\n\n### Playing in Erie (1981\u20131987)[edit]\n\n\nThe new Erie Cardinals played their home games at Ainsworth Field from 1981 to 1987. The team relocated to Hamilton, Ontario after the 1987 season and were replaced by the relocation of the Newark Orioles to Erie to become the Erie Orioles (now Hudson Valley Renegades) who played in the same league for the 1988 season.\n\n\n\n### Playing in Hamilton (1988\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hamilton Redbirds\n\nThe team was purchased by Albany businessman Joe Vellano and the team relocated to Bernie Arbour Memorial Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Redbirds. The team maintained its affiliation with the Cardinals and played in Hamilton from 1988 to 1992. In 1991, Vellano sold the Redbirds to a limited partnership headed by Barry Gordon and Marc Klee. Gordon and Klee planned to relocate the team to New Jersey where partner Rob Hillard was heading up management of a new stadium. The team spent a lame duck 1991 season in Hamilton, but in 1992, the team set the all-time record for winning percentage by a St. Louis Cardinals minor league team at .651, with a record of 56\u201320.\n\n\n\n### Playing in Glens Falls (1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe team relocated again to Glens Falls, New York, to become the Glens Falls Redbirds. The team still maintained its affiliation with the Cardinals. This relocation was only interim as the team played at East Field for the 1993 season only while the team was waiting for their new stadium in Sussex County, New Jersey to be completed.\n\n\nThe team's relocation to Glens Falls welcomed back professional baseball in five years. The team that previously played in Glens Falls before the Redbirds was the Eastern League's Glens Falls Tigers which relocated to London, Ontario and are now based in Trenton, New Jersey as the Trenton Thunder. Former owner Jack Tracz managed the interim operation and the manager for the 1993 season was Steve Turco after a season in which they had. Despite only agreeing to play in Glens Falls for one season, the team led the league in attendance with 78,725 and the team went 37\u201340, third in the 4-team McNamara Division, but just 4 games behind the Pittsfield Mets.\n\n\n\n### Playing in New Jersey (1994\u20132005)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Jersey Cardinals\n\nThe team completed its relocation to Augusta, New Jersey, which is located in Sussex County to become the New Jersey Cardinals despite having construction delays on the stadium and the apparent mismanagement by the stadium group which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 120 days before the start of the season. The team still maintained its affiliation with the Cardinals. The new stadium opened on schedule in large part due to the ownership and management of the Cardinals which was headed by Gordon and Klee's general manager Tony Torre. The team played their home games at Skylands Park from 1994 to 2005. The team put together a 43\u201332 regular-season mark, and then defeated the Jamestown Jammers, 2 games to 1, and the Auburn Astros, 2 games to 0, to win the league title.\n\n\nOver the next nine seasons, the team experienced only one more winning season, going 39\u201337 in 2002. While the team suffered through several losing seasons, they quietly established new standards for Minor League Baseball attendance. With the arrival of additional teams in the New York metropolitan area and further stadium mismanagement attendance, began to slip. The Cardinals drew a league-leading 142,417 fans in their inaugural season, following that up with 157,557 in 1995, but 115,342 in 2004. The team relocated again after the 2005 season and were replaced by Sussex Skyhawks of the independent Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball. This team folded after the 2010 season, leaving Skylands Park vacant for the first time in the stadium's history.\n\n\n\n### Playing in State College (2006\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2005, the owners agreed to sell the New Jersey Cardinals to a group headed by the principal partners of the Class Double-A Altoona Curve of the Eastern League. This allowed for a professional team to share Medlar Field at Lubrano Park with the host Penn State Nittany Lions baseball team, on whose campus the park stands. After the sale of the team was complete, the New Jersey Cardinals were then relocated to State College to become the State College Spikes. The team's new logo was then unveiled as a young white-tailed deer. The team's new colors became Penn State navy blue, cardinal, old gold, and moonlight yellow. The team still maintained their affiliation with the Cardinals in its first season in State College, but on September 21, 2006, the Spikes ended their affiliation with the Cardinals and became the new Class A-Short Season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, starting in 2007.[1]. In September 2012, the Spikes switched their affiliation from the Pirates back to the Cardinals.[2]\n\n\n\n### 2013 Year of the Deer[edit]\n\n\n2013 was the first of 2-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals. This would be the best year in the State College Spikes History to date with a winning season of 48\u201327 season. They were successful at home, with a strong 30\u20138 record. on the road was not so nice to them with a record of 18\u201319. If they were to make it to playoffs. They needed the home field advantage. They locked up the Pinckney Division over Jamestown Jammers who would make it to playoffs under the wildcard and what was very important Home field advantage. The Spikes would face the Jamestown Jammers for a 3-game Series for the right to play in the Championship game. They would lose the first game of the series and would win the next 2 that were at home and move into championship series against the Tri-City Valley Cats. Where they would win game 1 and return home only to lose and tie the series up, 1\u20131. The final game would see the Spikes jump out to a 1-run lead and have Tri-City answer that call with 4 runs. An amazing try in the bottom of the ninth with Mason Katz hitting a 2 run Home run to bring the score to 4\u20133 Tri-City but the State College Spikes would go 3 out with Cesar Valera going down swinging for the third and final out. Records were shattered with Jimmy Bosco outfielder hitting for the cycle, David Washington setting the single season record for home runs of 10 and 50 RBIs. Steven Ramos would win the Batting avg. race in the New York Penn League with a .341. This season would also see the Bull Penn have the lowest ERA in all of American Baseball Major League and Minor League. Thanks to the help of great pitchers of Mitch Harris, Kevin Herget, and Jacob Booden. The Spike would have multiple walk-off wins giving this team the nickname \"cardiac kids\" and a long list of multiple hit games and turning double plays. The State College Spikes hope to continue this winning ways in 2014\n\n\n\n### 2014 records will be broken[edit]\n\n\n2014 proved to be the start of a winning season. Most of 2013 players moved up and a new roster entered. One new player named Rowan Wick would belt a record 14 home runs out over the fences, breaking David Washington's record of 12 before being moved up to Single A Advanced. Jake Stone would wear the #32 and follow David Washington's run of Grand Slams belting one out of the park on July 4, the same day David Washington did. Alex Deloan would also join in the home run race hitting, 6 home runs. The State College Spikes team would put Auburn Dubbledays down on July 25, by setting a new single game run record with a score of 17\u20133 with the bottom third scoring 9 runs. The team was in the playoff chase again with a 7-game lead over Williamsport Crosscutters as of July 25.\n\n\n\n### 2016: Another championship comes to State College[edit]\n\n\nThe Spikes jumped out to a large divisional lead early in the 2016 season. While West Virginia and Williamsport both made late runs, State College easily won the Pinckney Division in mid-August and clinched the number one seed in the NYPL playoffs a week later. After taking game one of the semifinals against the Staten Island Yankees on the road, the Spikes lost game two at home to set up a winner-take-all game three. The Spikes won that game to set up a finals clash with the Hudson Valley Renegades, a team that had success against State College during the season and won the regular season series between the teams. Despite that, State College swept Hudson Valley in two games to clinch their second league title since relocation to Happy Valley.\n\n\n\n## Affiliation split with Pittsburgh[edit]\n\n\n\"We're not one of these ownership groups that demands a winner every single year, but we haven't even put playoff tickets on sale,\" Spikes general manager Jason Dambach said in June 2012. \"We've never really even come close to the playoffs. \"So the mandate has been put out there. We didn't have a good team last year, and so it really doesn't make any sense to re-sign with the Pirates until September, if we are to do that.\"[3] \"We weren't mad about J.D.'s comments,\" Pirates president Frank Coonelly said.[4] State College executives say some phone calls, texts and emails were never returned.[5] Greenberg said the affiliation decision from the Spikes' standpoint had \"zero\" to do with winning and losing.[4] In September 2012, the Pirates offered State College a player development contract extension.[5] Spikes owner Chuck Greenberg and Coonelly appeared to reach an agreement.[5] However, Greenberg never received a return phone call from anyone with the Pirates\u2014not owner Bob Nutting, nor Coonelly, nor GM Neal Huntington.[5] Huntington said that \"relationship endings are not always pretty,\" and this one appears to fall somewhere in that category.[4]\n\n\n\n## Team name[edit]\n\n\nThe team name \"Spikes\" has a threefold meaning. The club's official logo depicts a young white-tailed deer, for whom a \"spike\" is an undeveloped antler, symbolic of a young team member who may develop into a Major League Baseball player. The name also refers to a railroad spike, similar to the way the name \"Altoona Curve\" commemorates the famous Horseshoe Curve on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Finally, baseball players have long worn shoes with spikes. The team's official colors are Penn State navy blue, cardinal, old gold, and moonlight yellow.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season records[edit]\n\n\n(Place listed is finish in the six-team Pinckney Division, 2006\u20132019)\n\n\n\n* 2006: 39\u201336 (3rd), manager Mark DeJohn\n* 2007: 36\u201339 (3rd), manager Turner Ward\n* 2008: 18\u201356 (6th), manager Brad Fischer\n* 2009: 38\u201338 (3rd), manager Gary Robinson\n* 2010: 33\u201342 (5th), manager Dave Turgeon\n* 2011: 31\u201344 (n/a), manager Kimera Bartee\n* 2012: 35\u201341 (n/a), manager Dave Turgeon\n* 2013: 48\u201327(1st), manager Oliver Marmol\n* 2014: 48\u201328(1st), manager Oliver Marmol\n* 2015: 41-35(3rd), manager Johnny Rodriguez\n* 2017: 40-35 (2nd)\n* 2018: 36-40 (4th)\n* 2019: 39-36 (3rd), manager Jose Leon\n* 2021: 29-30-3 (4th), manager Delwyn Young\n\n\n## Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n* 2013 season: Defeated Jamestown 2\u20131 in semifinals; lost to Tri-City 2\u20131 in championship.\n* 2014 season: Defeated Hudson Valley 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Tri-City 2\u20131 to win championship.\n* 2016 season: Defeated Staten Island 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Hudson Valley 2\u20130 to win championship.\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nState College Spikes roster\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* -- Beau Balado\n* -- Chris Benavides\n* -- Jason Bollman\n* -- Cade Carlson\n* -- DJ Carpenter\n* -- Austin Cheeley\n* -- Johnny Cuevas\n* -- Josh Culliver\n* -- Drew Garrett\n* -- Jack Goonan\n* -- Kiernan Higgins\n* -- Richie Holetz\n* -- Drew Janssen\n* -- Jared Kengott\n* -- Spencer Koelewyn\n* -- Mason Mellott\n* -- Joseph Miceli\n* -- Griffin Miller\n* -- Andrew Moore\n* -- Connor Oliver\n* -- Andrew Peters\n* -- Payton Rice\n* -- Blake Seigler\n* -- Chris Wall\n* -- Logan Workman\n |  | **Catchers**\n* -- Jack Anderson\n* -- Matthew Ellis\n* -- Kenny Piper\n* -- Chase Stanke\n* -- Jack Surin\n* -- Will Kahn\n\n**Infielders**\n* -- Myles Austin\n* -- Brady Brecklin\n* -- Lukas Cook\n* -- Dax Fellows\n* -- Tyler Heckert\n* -- Kevin Karstetter\n* -- Marques Paige\n* -- Damiano Palmegiani\n* -- Zion Pettigrew\n* -- Mark Vierling\n* -- Mael Zan\n\n**Outfielders**\n* -- Hylan Hall\n* -- James Jett\n* -- Cameron Lee\n* -- Michael Slaten\n* -- Andre Tarver\n* -- Curtis Washington Jr.\n\n\n |  | **Manager**\n* -- Delwyn Young\n\n**Coaches**\n\n\n![](image) 7-day injured list\n~ Development list\n# Rehab assignment\n\u221e Reserve list\n\u2021 Restricted list\n\u00a7 Suspended list\n\u2020 Temporarily inactive list\nRoster updated February 1, 2021\n\n\nTransactions\n\u2192 More rosters: MiLB\u00a0\u2022\u00a0MLB Draft League\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mahoning Valley Scrappers Retain Affiliation With Major League Baseball in New MLB Draft League\". *Mahoning Valley Scrappers*.

They played their home games at TVA Credit Union Ballpark.[2] Before 1975, the team operated under several other names and affiliations.\n\n\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.[3][4] In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Cardinals were replaced by the Johnson City Doughboys, a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshmen and sophomores.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Playoffs[edit]\n\n\nIn 1955, Johnson City and the Salem Rebels were declared co-champions of the Appalachian League when their final playoff series was canceled due to rain.[7][8]\n\n\nFrom 1986 to 2019, Johnson City reached the playoffs by virtue of winning their division or clinching a playoff spot eight times. The results of their postseason play during this time was as follows.[9]\n\n\n\n* 1986: Lost to Pulaski 2\u20131 in finals.\n* 1987: Lost to Burlington 2\u20130 in finals.\n* 1994: Lost to Princeton 2\u20131 in finals.\n* 2010: Defeated Burlington 2\u20130 in semifinals; defeated Elizabethton 2\u20130 to win championship.\n* 2011: Defeated Danville 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Bluefield 2\u20131 to win championship.\n* 2012: Lost to Burlington 2\u20131 in semifinals.\n* 2014: Defeated Elizabethton 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Danville 2\u20131 to win championship.\n* 2016: Defeated Elizabethton 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Burlington 2\u20130 to win championship.\n* 2019: Defeated Bristol 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Burlington 2\u20131 to win championship.\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMany of the players fielded by Johnson City have gone on to distinguish themselves in Major League Baseball.[10]\n\n\n\n* Matt Adams (2009)\n* Rick Ankiel (2001)\n* Ron Blomberg (1967)\n* Glenn Brummer (1975)\n* Danny Cater (1958)\n* Vince Coleman (1982) 2 x MLB All-Star; 1985 NL Rookie of the Year\n* Pat Corrales (1959)\n* Danny Cox (1981)\n* Coco Crisp (1999)\n* Tony Cruz (2007)\n* Ray Culp (1959) 2 x MLB All-Star\n* Joe Cunningham (1949) 2 x MLB All-Star\n* Jeff Fassero (1984)\n* Curt Ford (1981)\n* Ron Guidry (1971) 4 x MLB All-Star; 2 x AL ERA Leader (1978-1979); 1978 AL CY Young Award\n* Cesar Geronimo (1967)\n* Mike Heath (1974)\n* Tom Herr (1975) MLB All-Star\n* LaMarr Hoyt (1973) MLB All-Star; 1983 AL Cy Young Award\n* Stan Javier (1981\u201382)\n* Terry Kennedy (1977) 4 x MLB All-Star\n* Ray Lankford (1987) MLB All-Star\n* Joe Magrane (1985) 1988 NL ERA Leader\n* Yadier Molina (2001) 8 x Gold Glove; 9 x MLB All-Star\n* Bill Monbouquette (1969, MGR) 4 x MLB All-Star\n* Jason Motte (2003) 2012 NL Saves Leader\n* Bobby Murcer (1964) 5 x MLB All-Star\n* Jerry Narron, MLB player, coach, and manager\n* Ken Oberkfell (1975)\n* Terry Pendleton (1982) MLB All-Star; 1991 NL Most Valuable Player\n* David Peralta (2006\u201307) Gold Glove, Silver Slugger\n* Tommy Pham (2006)\n* Ryan Sherriff (2011)\n* Chris Short (1957) 2 x MLB All-Star\n* Oscar Taveras (2010) Died, age 22\n* Otto Velez (1970)\n* Jack Wilson (1998) 2004 MLB All-Star\n* Bobby Wine (1957) Gold Glove\n* Dmitri Young (1991) 2 x MLB All-Star\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Johnson City, Tennessee Register City Encyclopedia\". *Baseball-Reference.com*.
