It is the tallest mountain in the world from base-to-peak on land, measuring 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m),[8] and Earth's highest mountain north of 43\u00b0N. With a topographic prominence of 20,194 feet (6,155\u00a0m)[3] and a topographic isolation of 4,621.1 miles (7,436.9\u00a0km),[3] Denali is the third most prominent and third-most isolated peak on Earth, after Mount Everest and Aconcagua. Located in the Alaska Range in the interior of the U.S. state of Alaska, Denali is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve.\n\n\n\n![](image)An aerial photo Denali in 1987\nThe Koyukon people who inhabit the area around the mountain have referred to the peak as \"Denali\" for centuries. In 1896, a gold prospector named it \"Mount McKinley\" in support of then-presidential candidate William McKinley; that name was the official name recognized by the federal government of the United States from 1917 until 2015. In August 2015, 40 years after Alaska had done so, the United States Department of the Interior announced the change of the official name of the mountain to Denali.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 1903, James Wickersham recorded the first attempt at climbing Denali, which was unsuccessful. In 1906, Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent, but this ascent is unverified and its legitimacy questioned. The first verifiable ascent to Denali's summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum, who went by the South Summit. In 1951, Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route, considered to be the safest and easiest route, and therefore the most popular currently in use.[11]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that the mountain is 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) high,[1] not 20,320 feet (6,194\u00a0m), as measured in 1952 using photogrammetry.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology and features[edit]\n\n\nDenali is a granitic pluton, mostly pink quartz monzonite, lifted by tectonic pressure from the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate; at the same time, the sedimentary material above and around the mountain was stripped away by erosion.[12][13] The forces that lifted Denali also caused many deep earthquakes in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the \"McKinley cluster\".[14]\n\n\nDenali has a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above 19,685 feet (6,000\u00a0m) elevation in the world.[1] Measured from base to peak at some 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m), it is among the largest mountains situated entirely above sea level. Denali rises from a sloping plain with elevations from 1,000 to 3,000\u00a0ft (300 to 910\u00a0m), for a base-to-peak height of 17,000 to 19,000\u00a0ft (5,000 to 6,000\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\nBy comparison, Mount Everest rises from the Tibetan Plateau at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from 13,800\u00a0ft (4,200\u00a0m) on the south side to 17,100\u00a0ft (5,200\u00a0m) on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of 12,000 to 15,300\u00a0ft (3,700 to 4,700\u00a0m).[16] Denali's base-to-peak height is little more than half the 33,500\u00a0ft (10,200\u00a0m) of the volcano Mauna Kea, which lies mostly under water.[17]\n\n\n\n### Geography of the mountain[edit]\n\n\nDenali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of 19,470\u00a0ft (5,934\u00a0m)[12] and a prominence of approximately 1,270\u00a0ft (387\u00a0m).[18] The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., fourteener) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the massif.\n\n\nFive large glaciers flow off the slopes of the mountain. The Peters Glacier lies on the northwest side of the massif, while the Muldrow Glacier falls from its northeast slopes. Just to the east of the Muldrow, and abutting the eastern side of the massif, is the Traleika Glacier. The Ruth Glacier lies to the southeast of the mountain, and the Kahiltna Glacier leads up to the southwest side of the mountain.[19][20] With a length of 44\u00a0mi (71\u00a0km), the Kahiltna Glacier is the longest glacier in the Alaska Range.\n\n\n\n## Naming[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Denali\u2013Mount McKinley naming dispute\n\nThe Koyukon Athabaskans who inhabit the area around the mountain have for centuries referred to the peak as *Dinale* or *Denali*. The name is based on a Koyukon word for 'high' or 'tall'.[21] During the Russian ownership of Alaska, the common name for the mountain was *Bolshaya Gora* (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430; *bolshaya* 'big'; *gora* 'mountain'), which is the Russian translation of *Denali*.[22] It was briefly called Densmore's Mountain in the late 1880s and early 1890s[23] after Frank Densmore, a gold prospector who was the first non-native Alaskan to reach the base of the mountain.[24]\n\n\nIn 1896, a gold prospector named it *McKinley* as political support for then-presidential candidate William McKinley, who became president the following year. The United States formally recognized the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the Mount McKinley National Park Act of February 26, 1917.[25] In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson declared the north and south peaks of the mountain the \"Churchill Peaks\", in honor of British statesman Winston Churchill.[26] The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to *Denali* in 1975, which was how it is called locally.[7][27] However, a request in 1975 from the Alaska state legislature to the United States Board on Geographic Names to do the same at the federal level was blocked by Ohio congressman Ralph Regula, whose district included McKinley's home town of Canton.[28]\n\n\nOn August 30, 2015, just ahead of a presidential visit to Alaska, the Barack Obama administration announced the name *Denali* would be restored in line with the Alaska Geographic Board's designation.[10][29] U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell issued the order changing the name to Denali on August 28, 2015, effective immediately.[9] Jewell said the change had been \"a long time coming\".[30] The renaming of the mountain received praise from Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK),[31] who had previously introduced legislation to accomplish the name change,[32] but it drew criticism from several politicians from President McKinley's home state of Ohio, such as Governor John Kasich, U.S. Senator Rob Portman, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, and Representative Bob Gibbs, who described Obama's action as \"constitutional overreach\" because he said an act of Congress was required to rename the mountain.[33][34][35] The *Alaska Dispatch News* reported that the Secretary of the Interior has authority under federal law to change geographic names when the Board of Geographic Names does not act on a naming request within a \"reasonable\" period of time. Jewell told the *Alaska Dispatch News* that \"I think any of us would think that 40 years is an unreasonable amount of time.\"[36]\n\n\nIndigenous names for Denali can be found in seven different Alaskan languages. The names fall into two categories. To the south of the Alaska Range in the Dena'ina and Ahtna languages the mountain is known by names that are translated as \"big mountain\". To the north of the Alaska Range in the Lower Tanana, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Holikachuk, and Deg Xinag languages the mountain is known by names that are translated as \"the high one\",[37] \"the tall one\" (Koyukon, Lower and Middle Tanana, Upper Kuskokwim, Deg Xinag, and Holikachuk), or \"big mountain\" (Ahtna and Dena'ina).[38]\n\n\nAsked about the importance of the mountain and its name, Will Mayo, former president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, an organization that represents 42 Athabaskan tribes in the Alaskan interior, said \"It's not one homogeneous belief structure around the mountain, but we all agree that we're all deeply gratified by the acknowledgment of the importance of Denali to Alaska's people.\"[39]\n\n\nThe following table lists the Alaskan Athabascan names for Denali.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Literal meaning\n | Native language\n | Spelling in thelocal practical alphabet\n | Spelling in astandardized alphabet\n | IPA transcription\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 'The tall one'\n | Koyukon | Deenaalee | Diinaalii | /di\u02d0\u02c8n\u00e6li/ |\n| Lower Tanana | Deenadheet, Deenadhee | Diinaadhiit, Diinaadhii | /di\u02c8n\u00e6\u00f0id/ |\n| Middle Tanana | Diineezi | Diinaadhi | /di\u02c8n\u00e6\u00f0i/ |\n| Upper Kuskokwim | Denaze | Diinaazii | /di\u02c8n\u00e6zi/ |\n| Deg Xinag | Dengadh, Dengadhi | Dengadh, Dengadhe | /t\u0259\u02c8\u014ba\u00f0, t\u0259\u02c8\u014ba\u00f0\u0259/ |\n| Holikachuk | Denadhe | Diinaadhii | /di\u02d0\u02c8n\u00e6\u00f0i\u02d0/ |\n| 'Big mountain'\n | Ahtna | Dghelaay Ce'e, Deghilaay Ce'e | Dghelaay Ke'e, Deghilaay Ke'e | /d\u0281\u025b\u02c8l\u0254j \u02c8k\u025b\u0294\u025b/ |\n| Upper Inlet Dena'ina | Dghelay Ka'a | Dghelay Ka'a | /d\u0281\u0259\u02c8laj \u02c8ka\u0294a/ |\n| Lower Inlet Dena'ina | Dghili Ka'a | Dghili Ka'a | /d\u0281ili \u02c8ka\u0294a/ |\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![In a grayscale photograph, two men stand in front of a tent and snowy evergreen trees](image)Hudson Stuck and Harry Karstens, co-leaders of the first successful expedition of four to reach the summit of Denali in 1913, the other members of the expedition being Robert G. Tatum and Walter Harper\nThe Koyukon Athabaskans, living in the Yukon, Tanana and Kuskokwim basins, were the first Native Americans with access to the flanks of the mountain.[4] A British naval captain and explorer, George Vancouver, is the first European on record to have sighted Denali, when he noted \"distant stupendous mountains\" while surveying the Knik Arm of the Cook Inlet on May 6, 1794.[40] The Russian explorer Lavrenty Zagoskin explored the Tanana and Kuskokwim rivers in 1843 and 1844, and was likely the first European to sight the mountain from the other side.[41]\n\n\nWilliam Dickey, a New Hampshire-born resident of Seattle, Washington who had been digging for gold in the sands of the Susitna River, wrote, after his returning from Alaska, an account in the *New York Sun* that appeared on January 24, 1897.[42] His report drew attention with the sentence \"We have no doubt that this peak is the highest in North America, and estimate that it is over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m) high.\" Until then, Mount Logan in Canada's Yukon Territory was believed to be the continent's highest point. Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m).[43] These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as 20,300 feet (6,200\u00a0m).[44]\n\n\nOn November 5, 2012, the United States Mint released a twenty-five cent piece depicting Denali National Park. It is the fifteenth of the America the Beautiful Quarters series. The reverse features a Dall sheep with the peak of Denali in the background.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climbing history[edit]\n\n\nDuring the summer of 1902 scientist Alfred Brooks explored the flanks of the mountain as a part of an exploratory surveying party conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey. The party landed at Cook Inlet in late May, then traveled east, paralleling the Alaska Range, before reaching the slopes of Denali in early August. Camped on the flank of the mountain on August 3, Brooks noted later that while \"the ascent of Mount McKinley had never been part of our plans\", the party decided to delay one day so \"that we might actually set foot on the slopes of the mountain\". Setting off alone, with good weather, on August 4, Brooks aimed to reach a 10,000 feet (3,048\u00a0m) shoulder. At 7,500 feet (2,286\u00a0m), Brooks found his way blocked by sheer ice and, after leaving a small cairn as a marker, descended.[46] After the party's return, Brooks co-authored a \"Plan For Climbing Mt McKinley\", published in *National Geographic* magazine in January 1903, with fellow party-member and topographer D. L. Raeburn, in which they suggested that future attempts at the summit should approach from the north, not the south.[47] The report received substantial attention, and within a year, two climbing parties declared their intent to summit.[48]\n\n\nDuring the early summer of 1903, Judge James Wickersham, then of Eagle, Alaska, made the first recorded attempt to climb Denali, along with a party of four others. The group attempted to get as close to the mountain as possible via the Kantishna river by steamer, before offloading and following Chitsia Creek with a poling boat, mules and backpacks, a route suggested to them by Tanana Athabaskan people they met along the way. The party received further navigational assistance at Anotoktilon, an Athabaskan hunting camp, where residents gave the group detailed directions to reach the glaciers at the foot of Denali. On reaching the mountain, the mountaineers set up base camp on the lower portion of Peters Glacier. Aiming for the northwest buttress of Denali's north peak, they attempted to ascend directly; however, crevasses, ice fall and the lack of a clear passage caused them to turn and attempt to follow a spur via Jeffery Glacier where they believed they could see a way to the summit. After a dangerous ascent, at around 10,000 feet (3,048\u00a0m), Wickersham found that the route did not connect as it had appeared from below, instead discovering \"a tremendous precipice beyond which we cannot go. Our only line of further ascent would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and that is impossible.\" This wall, now known as the Wickersham Wall, juts 15,000 feet (4,572\u00a0m) upwards from the glacier to the north peak of Denali.[49] Because of the route's history of avalanche danger, it was not successfully climbed until 1963.[50]\n\n\nLater in the summer of 1903, Dr. Frederick Cook directed a team of five men on another attempt at the summit. Cook was already an experienced explorer and had been a party-member on successful arctic expeditions commanded both by Robert Peary and Roald Amundsen.[49][51] Yet he struggled to obtain funding for his own expedition, eventually organizing it \"on a shoestring budget\"[52] without any other experienced climbers.[51] The party navigated up the Cook inlet and followed the path of the 1902 Brooks party towards Denali. Cook approached the mountain via the Peters Glacier, as Wickersham had done; however, he was able to overcome the ice fall that had caused the previous group to turn up the spur towards the Wickersham Wall. Despite avoiding this obstacle, on August 31, having reached an elevation of about 10,900 feet (3,322\u00a0m) on the northwest buttress of the north peak, the party found they had reached a dead end and could make no further progress. On the descent, the group completely circumnavigated the mountain, the first climbing party to do so.[53] Although Cook's 1903 expedition did not reach the summit, he received acclaim for the accomplishment, a 1,000 miles (1,609\u00a0km) trek in which he not only circled the entire mountain but also found, on the descent, an accessible pass northeast of the Muldrow Glacier following the headwaters of the Toklat and Chulitna rivers.[49]\n\n\nIn 1906, Cook initiated another expedition to Denali with co-leader Herschel Parker, a Columbia University professor of electrical engineering with extensive mountaineering experience. Belmore Browne, an experienced climber and five other men comprised the rest of the group. Cook and Parker's group spent most of the summer season exploring the southern and southeastern approaches to the mountain, eventually reaching a high point on Tokositna glacier, 25 miles (40\u00a0km) from the summit.[53] During their explorations the party mapped out many of the tributaries and glaciers of the Susitna river along the mountain's south flank.[49] As the summer ended, the team retreated to the coast and began to disperse. In September 1906, Cook and a single party-member, horseman Robert Barrill, journeyed towards the summit again, in what Cook later described as \"a last desperate attempt\" in a telegram to his financial backers.[49] Cook and Barrill spent 12 days in total on the attempt, and claimed to have reached the summit via the Ruth Glacier.[52]\n\n\nUpon hearing Cook's claims, Parker and Browne were immediately suspicious. Browne later wrote that he knew Cook's claims were lies, just as \"any New Yorker would know that no man could walk from the Brooklyn Bridge to Grant's Tomb [a distance of eight miles] in ten minutes.\"[52] In May 1907, *Harper's Magazine* published Cook's account of the climb along with a photograph of what appeared to be Barrill standing on the summit. By 1909, Barrill had recanted at least part of his story about the climb, and others publicly questioned the account; however, Cook continued to assert his claim[54] The controversy continued for decades. In 1956, mountaineers Bradford Washburn and Walter Gonnason tried to settle the matter, with Gonnason attempting to follow Cook's purported route to the summit. Washburn noted inconsistencies between Cook's account of locations of glaciers and found a spot, at 5,400 feet (1,646\u00a0m) and 19 miles (31\u00a0km) southeast of the summit that appeared identical to the supposed summit image. Gonnason was not able to complete the climb, but because he was turned back by poor weather, felt that this did not definitely disprove Cook's story.[55] In 1998, historian Robert Bryce discovered an original and un-cropped version of the \"fake peak\" photograph of Barrill standing on the promontory. It showed a wider view of surrounding features, appearing to definitively discount Cook's claim.[56]\n\n\n\n![Several tents are pitched near the edge of a snow-covered cliff](image)High camp (17,200\u00a0ft or 5,200\u00a0m) of the West Buttress Route pioneered by Bradford Washburn, photographed in 2001\nGiven the skepticism concerning Cook's story, interest in claiming the first ascent remained. Miners and other Alaskans living in Kantishna and Fairbanks wanted the honors to go to local men. In 1909, four Alaska residents \u2013 Tom Lloyd, Peter Anderson, Billy Taylor, and Charles McGonagall \u2013 set out from Fairbanks, Alaska during late December with supplies and dogs that were in part paid for by bettors in a Fairbanks tavern. By March 1910, the men had established a base camp near one of the sites where the Brooks party had been and pressed on from the north via the Muldrow glacier. Unlike some previous expeditions, they discovered a pass, since named McGonagall Pass, which allowed them to bypass the Wickersham Wall and access the higher reaches of the mountain. At roughly 11,000 feet (3,353\u00a0m), Tom Lloyd, old and less physically fit than the others, stayed behind. According to their account, the remaining three men pioneered a route following Karstens Ridge around the Harper Icefall, then reached the upper basin before ascending to Pioneer Ridge. The three men carried a 14-foot-long (4.3\u00a0m) spruce pole. Around 19,000 feet (5,791\u00a0m), Charles McGonagall, older and having exhausted himself carrying the spruce pole, remained behind. On April 3, 1910, Billy Taylor and Peter Anderson scrambled the final few hundred feet to reach the north peak of Denali, at 19,470 feet (5,934\u00a0m) high, the shorter of the two peaks. The pair erected the pole near the top, with the hope that it would be visible from lower reaches to prove they had made it.[57]\n\n\nAfter the expedition, Tom Lloyd returned to Fairbanks, while the three others remained in Kantishna to mine. In Lloyd's recounting, all four men made it to the top of not only the north peak, but the higher south peak as well. When the remaining three men returned to town with conflicting accounts, the entire expedition's legitimacy was questioned.[58] Several years later, another climbing group would claim to have seen the spruce pole in the distance, supporting their north peak claim.[57] However, some continue to doubt they reached the summit. Outside of the single later climbing group, who were friendly with some of the Sourdough expedition men, no other group would ever see it. Jon Waterman, author of the book *Chasing Denali*, which explored the controversy, outlined several reasons to doubt the claim: There was never any photographic evidence. The four men climbed during the winter season, known for much more difficult conditions, along a route that has never been fully replicated. They were inexperienced climbers, ascending without any of the usual safety gear or any care for altitude sickness. They claimed to have ascended from 11,000 feet (3,353\u00a0m) to the top in less than 18 hours, unheard of at a time when siege-style alpinism was the norm.[59] Yet Waterman says \"these guys were men of the trail. They didn't care what anybody thought. They were just tough SOBs.\"[60] He noted that the men were largely unlettered and that some of the ensuing doubt was related to their lack of sophistication in dealing with the press and the contemporary climbing establishment.[59]\n\n\nIn 1912, the Parker-Browne expedition nearly reached the summit, turning back within just a few hundred yards/meters of it due to harsh weather. On July 7, the day after their descent, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake shattered the glacier they had ascended.[61][62][63]\n\n\nThe first ascent of the main summit of Denali came on June 7, 1913, by a party directed by Hudson Stuck and Harry Karstens, along with Walter Harper and Robert Tatum. Karstens relocated to Alaska in the gold rush of 1897, and in subsequent years became involved in a variety of endeavors beyond mining, including helping establish dog mushing routes to deliver mail across vast swathes of territory and supporting expeditions led by naturalist Charles Sheldon near the base of Denali.[64] Stuck was an English-born Episcopal priest who came to Alaska by chance. He became acclimated to the often harsh Alaskan environment because of his many travels between far-flung outposts within his district, climbing mountains as a hobby.[65] At 21 years old, Harper was already known as a skilled and strong outdoorsman, the Alaska-born son of a Koyukon-Athabascan mother and Irish gold prospector father.[66][67] Tatum, also 21 years old, was a theology student working at a Tanana mission, and the least experienced of the team. His primary responsibility on the trip was as a cook.[68]\n\n\nThe team approached the peak from the north via the Muldrow glacier and McGonagall pass. While ferrying loads up to a camp at around 10,800 feet (3,292\u00a0m), they suffered a setback when a stray match accidentally set fire to some supplies, including several tents. The prior year's earthquake had left what had previously been described by the Parker-Browne expedition as a gentle slope ascended in no more than three days as a dangerous, ice-strewn morass on a knife-edged ridge (later named Karstens ridge). It would take the team three weeks to cover the same ground, as Karstens and Harper laboriously cut steps into the ice. On May 30, the team, with the help of some good weather, ascended to a new high camp, situated at 17,500 feet (5,334\u00a0m) in the Grand Basin between the north and south peaks. On June 7, the team made the summit attempt. Temperatures were below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) at times. Every man, and particularly Stuck, suffered from altitude sickness. By midday, Harper became the first climber to reach the summit, followed seconds later by Tatum and Karstens. Stuck arrived last, falling unconscious on the summit.[69]\n\n\nUsing the mountain's contemporary name, Tatum later commented, \"The view from the top of Mount McKinley is like looking out the windows of Heaven!\"[70] During the climb, Stuck spotted, via binoculars, the presence of a large pole near the North Summit; this report confirmed the Sourdough ascent, and it is widely believed presently that the Sourdoughs did succeed on the North Summit. However, the pole was never seen before or since, so there is still some doubt. Stuck also discovered that the Parker-Browne party were only about 200 feet (61\u00a0m) of elevation short of the true summit when they turned back. Stuck and Karstens' team achieved the uncontroversial first ascent of Denali's south peak; however, the news was met with muted interest by the wider climbing community. *Appalachia Journal*, then the official journal of the American Alpine Club, published a small notice of the accomplishment a year later.[65]\n\n\nThe mountain is climbed regularly nowadays. In 2003, around 58% of climbers reached the top. But by that time, the mountain had claimed the lives of nearly 100 mountaineers.[71] The vast majority of climbers use the West Buttress Route, pioneered in 1951 by Bradford Washburn,[11] after an extensive aerial photographic analysis of the mountain. Climbers typically take two to four weeks to ascend Denali. It is one of the Seven Summits; summiting all of them is a challenge for mountaineers.\n\n\nOn August 4, 2018, five people died in the K2 Aviation de Havilland Beaver (DHC-2) crash near Denali.\n\n\n\n### Accidents[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1947 to 2018 in the United States \"2,799 people were reported to be involved in mountaineering accidents\"[72] and 11% of these accidents occurred on Denali.[72] Of these 2,799 accidents, 43% resulted in death and 8% of these deaths occurred on Denali.[72]\n\n\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![An aerial view of Denali; an airplane wing is visible in the lower-left corner](image)Denali's West Buttress (lower left to upper right), August 2010\n![A rotating 3-D computer image of the mountain](image)A three-dimensional representation of the mountain created with topographic data\n* 1896\u20131902: Surveys by Robert Muldrow, George Eldridge, Alfred Brooks.[73]\n* 1913: First ascent, by Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum via the Muldrow Glacier route.[74]\n* 1932: Second ascent, by Alfred Lindley, Harry Liek, Grant Pearson, Erling Strom.

This weather station was designed to transmit data in real-time for use by the climbing public and the science community. Since its establishment, annual upgrades to the equipment have been performed with instrumentation custom built for the extreme weather and altitude conditions. This weather station is the third-highest weather station in the world.[101]\n\n\nThe weather station recorded a temperature of \u221275.5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221259.7\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 1, 2003. On the previous day of November 30, 2003, a temperature of \u221274.4\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221259.1\u00a0\u00b0C) combined with a wind speed of 18.4 miles per hour (29.6\u00a0km/h) to produce a North American record windchill of \u2212118.1\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221283.4\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\n\nEven in July, this weather station has recorded temperatures as low as \u221222.9\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230.5\u00a0\u00b0C) and windchills as low as \u221259.2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221250.7\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n### Historical record[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, in 1932 the Liek-Lindley expedition recovered a self-recording minimum thermometer left near Browne's Tower, at about 15,000 feet (4,600\u00a0m), on Denali by the Stuck-Karstens party in 1913. The spirit thermometer was calibrated down to \u221295\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221271\u00a0\u00b0C), and the lowest recorded temperature was below that point. Harry J. Liek took the thermometer back to Washington, D.C. where it was tested by the United States Weather Bureau and found to be accurate. The lowest temperature that it had recorded was found to be approximately \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221273\u00a0\u00b0C).[102] Another thermometer was placed at the 15,000-foot (4,600\u00a0m) level by the U.S. Army Natick Laboratory, and was there from 1950 to 1969. The coldest temperature recorded during that period was also \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221273\u00a0\u00b0C).[103]\n\n\n\n## Subpeaks and nearby mountains[edit]\n\n\n![The top of Denali is shrouded in clouds](image)Denali, here shrouded in clouds, is large enough to create its own localized weather\nBesides the North Summit mentioned above, other features on the massif which are sometimes included as separate peaks are:\n\n\n\n* South Buttress, 15,885 feet (4,842\u00a0m); mean prominence: 335 feet (102\u00a0m)\n* East Buttress high point, 14,730 feet (4,490\u00a0m); mean prominence: 380 feet (120\u00a0m)\n* East Buttress, most topographically prominent point, 14,650 feet (4,470\u00a0m); mean prominence: 600 feet (180\u00a0m)\n* Browne Tower, 14,530 feet (4,430\u00a0m); mean prominence: 75 feet (23\u00a0m)\n\n\nNearby peaks include:\n\n\n\n* Mount Crosson\n* Mount Foraker\n* Mount Silverthrone\n* Mount Hunter\n* Mount Huntington\n* Mount Dickey\n* The Moose's Tooth\n\n\n## Taxonomic honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ice Sheets on Denali\n* *denaliensis*\n\t+ *Ceratozetella denaliensis* (formerly *Cyrtozetes denaliensis* Behan-Pelletier, 1985) is a species of moss mite in the family Mycobatidae sv:Ceratozetella denaliensis\n\t+ *Magnoavipes denaliensis* Fiorillo et al., 2011 (literally \"bird with large feet found in Denali\") is a *Magnoavipes* ichnospecies of bird footprint from the Upper Cretaceous of Alaska and was a large heron-like bird (as larger than a sandhill crane) with three toes and toe pads. pt:Magnoavipes denaliensis\n* *denali*\n\t+ *Cosberella denali\u00a0[sv]* (Fjellberg, 1985) is a springtail.\n\t+ *Proclossiana aphirape denali* Klots, 1940 is a *Boloria* butterfly species of the subfamily Heliconiinae of family Nymphalidae.\n\t+ *Symplecta denali\u00a0[sv]* (Alexander, 1955) is a species of crane fly in the family Limoniidae.\n\t+ *Tipula denali\u00a0[sv]* Alexander, 1969 is a species of crane fly in the family Tipulidae.\n* *denalii*\n\t+ *Erigeron denalii* A.

Denali is the third most topographically prominent and third most topographically isolated summit on Earth after Mount Everest and Aconcagua.\nThis article comprises three sortable tables of major mountain peaks[a] of the U.S. State of Alaska.\n\n\nThe summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:\n\n\n\n1. The topographic elevation of a summit measures the height of the summit above a geodetic sea level.[b] The first table below ranks the 100 highest major summits of Alaska by elevation.\n2. The topographic prominence of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.[c][b] The second table below ranks the 100 most prominent summits of Alaska.\n3. The topographic isolation (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.[d] The third table below ranks the 50 most isolated major summits of Alaska.\n\n\n\n## Highest major summits[edit]\n\n\n**Map this section's coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nSee also: List of the major 4000-meter summits of Alaska\n\nOf the 100 highest major summits of Alaska, only Denali exceeds 6000 meters (19,685 feet) elevation, four peaks exceed 5000 meters (16,404 feet), 23 peaks exceed 4000 meters (13,123 feet), 61 peaks exceed 3000 meters (9843 feet), and 92 peaks exceed 2000 meters (6562 feet) elevation.

The mountain is about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) east of El Paso and about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The peak rises more than 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m) above the arid floor of the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\n\n\n\n## Trail and summit[edit]\n\n\nThe peak can be climbed at any time of the year by a maintained stony trail (4.25 miles or 6.8 kilometers each way) with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain.[5] The trail is part of the network of hiking trails in the surrounding national park.\n\n\nA stainless steel pyramid marks the summit. It was erected by American Airlines in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach route that passed south of the mountain. One side of the pyramid has the American Airlines logo. The second side displays a U.S. Postal Service tribute to the Pony Express Riders of the Butterfield Stage.

Its eastern border lies along 103\u00b0W longitude with the state of Oklahoma, and 2.2 miles (3.5 kilometres) west of 103\u00b0W longitude with Texas (due to a 19th-century surveying error).[2][3] On the southern border, Texas makes up the eastern two-thirds, while the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora make up the western third, with Chihuahua making up about 90% of that. The western border with Arizona runs along the 109\u00b0 03'W longitude.[4] The southwestern corner of the state is known as the Bootheel. The 37\u00b0N parallel forms the northern boundary with Colorado. The states of New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah come together at the Four Corners in New Mexico's northwestern corner. Its surface water area is about 292 square miles (760\u00a0km2).[1]\n\n\nDespite its popular depiction as mostly arid desert, New Mexico has one of the most diverse landscapes of any U.S. state, ranging from wide, auburn-colored deserts and verdant grasslands, to broken mesas and high, snow-capped peaks.[5] Close to a third of the state is covered in timberland, with heavily forested mountain wildernesses dominating the north. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost part of the Rocky Mountains, run roughly north\u2013south along the east side of the Rio Grande, in the rugged, pastoral north. The Great Plains extend into the eastern third of the state, most notably the Llano Estacado (\"Staked Plain\"), whose westernmost boundary is marked by the Mescalero Ridge escarpment. The northwestern quadrant of New Mexico is dominated by the Colorado Plateau, characterized by unique volcanic formations, dry grasslands and shrublands, open pinyon-juniper woodland, and mountain forests.[6] The Chihuahuan Desert, which is the largest in North America, extends through the south.\n\n\nOver four\u2013fifths of New Mexico is higher than 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) above sea level. The average elevation ranges from up to 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level in the northwest, to less than 4,000 feet in the southeast.[5] The highest point is Wheeler Peak at over 13,160 feet (4,010 meters) in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, while the lowest is the Red Bluff Reservoir at around 2,840 feet (870 meters), in the southeastern corner of the state.\n\n\nIn addition to the Rio Grande, which is tied for the fourth-longest river in the U.S., New Mexico has four other major river systems: the Pecos, Canadian, San Juan, and Gila.[7] Nearly bisecting New Mexico from north to south, the Rio Grande has played an influential role in the region's history; its fertile floodplain has supported human habitation since prehistoric times, and European settlers initially lived exclusively in its valleys and along its tributaries.[5] The Pecos, which flows roughly parallel to the Rio Grande at its east, was a popular route for explorers, as was the Canadian River, which rises in the mountainous north and flows east across the arid plains. The San Juan and Gila lie west of the Continental Divide, in the northwest and southwest, respectively. With the exception of the Gila, all major rivers are dammed in New Mexico and provide a major water source for irrigation and flood control.\n\n\nAside from its rivers, New Mexico has few sizeable natural bodies of water; there are several artificial lakes and reservoirs, the largest being Elephant Butte Reservoir, which was created by the damming of the Rio Grande. At its height in the early 20th century, the reservoir was the largest man-made lake in the world.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of New Mexico, using 1991-2020 climate normals\nNew Mexico has long been known for its dry, temperate climate.[5] Overall the state is semi-arid to arid, with areas of continental and alpine climates at higher elevations. New Mexico's statewide average precipitation is 13.7 inches (350\u00a0mm) a year, with average monthly amounts peaking in the summer, particularly in the more rugged north-central area around Albuquerque and in the south. Generally, the eastern third of the state receives the most rainfall, while the western third receives the least. Higher altitudes receive around 40 inches (1,000\u00a0mm), while the lowest elevations see as little as 8 to 10 inches (200 to 250 millimetres).[5]\n\n\nAnnual temperatures can range from 65\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C) in the southeast to below 40\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C) in the northern mountains,[4] with the average being the mid-50s \u00b0F (12\u00a0\u00b0C). During the summer, daytime temperatures can often exceed 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) at elevations below 5,000 feet (1,500\u00a0m); the average high temperature in July ranges from 99\u00a0\u00b0F (37\u00a0\u00b0C) at the lower elevations down to 78\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) at the higher elevations. In the colder months of November to March, many cities in New Mexico can have nighttime temperature lows in the teens above zero, or lower. The highest temperature recorded in New Mexico was 122\u00a0\u00b0F (50\u00a0\u00b0C) at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Loving on June 27, 1994; the lowest recorded temperature is \u221250\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221246\u00a0\u00b0C) at Gavilan (near Lindrith) on February 1, 1951.[9]\n\n\nNew Mexico's stable climate and sparse population provides for clearer skies and less light pollution, making it a popular site for several major astronomical observatories, including the Apache Point Observatory, the Very Large Array, and the Magdalena Ridge Observatory, among others.[10][11]\n\n\n\n### Climate data[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for New Mexico (general)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n |

distinct vegetation zones that provide diverse sets of habitats for many plants and animals.[20] The Upper Sonoran Zone is by far the most prominent, constituting about three-fourths of the state; it includes most of the plains, foothills, and valleys above 4,500 feet, and is defined by prairie grasses, low pi\u00f1on pines, and juniper shrubs. The Llano Estacado in the east features shortgrass prairie with blue grama, which sustain bison. The Chihuahuan Desert in the south is characterized by shrubby creosote. The Colorado Plateau in the northwest corner of New Mexico is high desert with cold winters, featuring sagebrush, shadescale, greasewood, and other plants adapted to the saline and seleniferous soil.\n\n\nThe mountainous north hosts a wide array of vegetation types corresponding to elevation gradients, such as pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands near the base, through evergreen conifers, spruce-fir and aspen forests in the transitionary zone, and Krummholz, and alpine tundra at the very top.[20] The Apachian zone tucked into the southwestern bootheel of the state has high-calcium soil, oak woodlands, Arizona cypress, and other plants that are not found in other parts of the state.[21][22] The southern sections of the Rio Grande and Pecos valleys have 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometres) of New Mexico's best grazing land and irrigated farmland.\n\n\nNew Mexico's varied climate and vegetation zones consequently support diverse wildlife. Black bears, bighorn sheep, bobcats, cougars, deer, and elk live in habitats above 7,000 feet, while coyotes, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, javelina, porcupines, pronghorn antelope, western diamondbacks, and wild turkeys live in less mountainous and elevated regions.[23][24][25] The iconic roadrunner, which is the state bird, is abundant in the southeast. Endangered species include the Mexican gray wolf, which is being gradually reintroduced in the world, and Rio Grande silvery minnow.[26] Over 500 species of birds live or migrate through New Mexico, third only to California and Mexico.[27]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nNew Mexico and 12 other western states together account for 93% of all federally owned land in the U.S. Roughly one\u2013third of the state, or 24.7 million of 77.8 million acres, is held by the U.S. government, the tenth-highest percentage in the country. More than half this land is under the Bureau of Land Management, while another third is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n\nNew Mexico was central to the early\u201320th century conservation movement, with Gila Wilderness being designated the world's first wilderness area in 1924.[28] The state also hosts nine of the country's 84 national monuments, the most of any state after Arizona; these include the second oldest monument, El Morro, which was created in 1906, and the Gila Cliff Dwellings, proclaimed in 1907.[28]\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Forests **in New Mexico**[29]\n| Carson National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Cibola National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Lincoln National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Santa Fe National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Gila National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Gila Wilderness | ![](image) |\n| Coronado National Forest (in Hidalgo County)\n | ![](image) |\n\n\nAreas managed by the National Park Service include:[30]\n\n\n\n* Aztec Ruins National Monument at Aztec\n* Bandelier National Monument in Los Alamos\n* Capulin Volcano National Monument near Capulin\n* Carlsbad Caverns National Park near Carlsbad\n* Chaco Culture National Historical Park at Nageezi\n* El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail\n* El Malpais National Monument in Grants\n* El Morro National Monument in Ramah\n* Fort Union National Monument at Watrous\n* Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument near Silver City\n* Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument[31]\n* Old Spanish National Historic Trail\n* Organ Mountains\u00a0\u2013 Desert Peaks National Monument near Las Cruces\n* Manhattan Project National Historical Park\n* Pecos National Historical Park in Pecos\n* Petroglyph National Monument near Albuquerque\n* Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument at Mountainair\n* Santa Fe National Historic Trail\n* White Sands National Park near Alamogordo\n* Rio Grande del Norte National Monument near Taos\n* Valles Caldera National Preserve in the Jemez Mountains\n\nNational Wildlife Refuges in New Mexico managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service include:\n\n\n\n* Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge\n* Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge\n* Grulla National Wildlife Refuge\n* Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge\n* Maxwell National Wildlife Refuge\n* San Andres National Wildlife Refuge\n* Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge\n* Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge in the City of Albuquerque's South Valley\n\n\nindependent wildlife refuges in New Mexico include:\n\n\n\n* Whitfield Wildlife Conservation Area in Valencia County \u00b7 Whitfield Wildlife Conservation Area \u2013 Valencia Soil and Water Conservation District\n\n\nAreas managed by the New Mexico State Parks Division:[32][Note 1]\n\n\n\n* Bluewater Lake State Park\n* Bottomless Lakes State Park\n* Brantley Lake State Park\n* Cerrillos Hills State Park\n* Caballo Lake State Park\n* Cimarron Canyon State Park\n* City of Rocks State Park\n* Clayton Lake State Park\n* Conchas Lake State Park\n* Coyote Creek State Park\n* Eagle Nest Lake State Park\n* Elephant Butte Lake State Park\n* El Vado Lake State Park\n* Heron Lake State Park\n* Hyde Memorial State Park\n* Leasburg Dam State Park\n* Living Desert Zoo and Gardens State Park\n* Manzano Mountains State Park\n* Mesilla Valley Bosque State Park\n* Morphy Lake State Park\n* Navajo Lake *(Rio Arriba, NM and San Juan, NM)*\n* Oasis State Park\n* Oliver Lee Memorial State Park\n* Pancho Villa State Park\n* Percha Dam State Park\n* Rio Grande Nature Center State Park\n* Rio Grande Valley State Park\n* Rockhound State Park\n* Santa Rosa Lake State Park\n* Storrie Lake State Park\n* Sugarite Canyon State Park\n* Sumner Lake State Park\n* Fenton Lake State Park\n* Ute Lake State Park\n* Villanueva State Park\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2016, New Mexico sued the United States Environmental Protection Agency over negligence after the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill. The spill had caused heavy metals such as cadmium and lead and toxins such as arsenic to flow into the Animas River, polluting water basins of several states.[33] The state has since implemented or considered stricter regulations and harsher penalties for spills associated with resource extraction.[34]\n\n\nNew Mexico is a major producer of greenhouse gases.[35] A study by Colorado State University showed that the state's oil and gas industry generated 60 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2018, over four times greater than previously estimated.[35] The fossil fuels sector accounted for over half the state's overall emissions, which totaled 113.6 million metric tons, about 1.8% of the country's total and more than twice the national average per capita.[35][36] The New Mexico government has responded with efforts to regulate industrial emissions, promote renewable energy, and incentivize the use of electric vehicles.[36][37]\n\n\n\n## Settlements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of municipalities in New Mexico, List of census-designated places in New Mexico, and List of counties in New Mexico\n\n![](image)New Mexico population density mapWith just 17 people\u00a0per square mile (6.6 people/km2), New Mexico is one of the least densely populated states, ranking 45th out of 50. By contrast, the overall population density of the U.S. is 90/sq\u00a0mi (35/km2). The state is divided into 33 counties and 106 municipalities, which include cities, towns, villages, and a consolidated city-county, Los Alamos. Only two cities have at least 100,000 residents: Albuquerque and Las Cruces, whose respective metropolitan areas together account for the majority of New Mexico's population.\n\n\nResidents are concentrated in the north-central region of New Mexico, anchored by the state's largest city, Albuquerque. Centered in Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque metropolitan area includes New Mexico's third-largest city, Rio Rancho, and has a population of over 918,000, accounting for one-third of all New Mexicans. It is adjacent to Santa Fe, the capital and fourth-largest city. Altogether, the Albuquerque\u2013Santa Fe\u2013Las Vegas combined statistical area includes more than 1.17 million people, or nearly 60% of the state population.\n\n\nNew Mexico's other major center of population is in south-central area around Las Cruces, its second-largest city and the largest city in the southern region of the state. The Las Cruces metropolitan area includes roughly 214,000 residents, but with neighboring El Paso, Texas forms a combined statistical area numbering over 1 million.[38]\n\n\nNew Mexico hosts 23 federally recognized tribal reservations, including part of the Navajo Nation, the largest and most populous tribe; of these, 11 hold off-reservation trust lands elsewhere in the state. The vast majority of federally recognized tribes are concentrated in the northwest, followed by the north-central region.\n\n\nLike several other southwestern states, New Mexico hosts numerous *colonias*, a type of unincorporated, low-income slum characterized by abject poverty, the absence of basic services (such as water and sewage), and scarce housing and infrastructure.[39] The University of New Mexico estimates there are 118 colonias in the state, though the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development identifies roughly 150.[40] The majority are located along the Mexico-U.S. border.\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in New MexicoSource: 2017 U.S. Census Bureau Estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | County | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Albuquerque](image)Albuquerque![Las Cruces](image)Las Cruces | 1 | Albuquerque | Bernalillo | 558,545\n | ![Rio Rancho](image)Rio Rancho![Santa Fe](image)Santa Fe |\n| 2 | Las Cruces | Do\u00f1a Ana | 101,712\n |\n| 3 | Rio Rancho | Sandoval / Bernalillo | 96,159\n |\n| 4 | Santa Fe | Santa Fe | 83,776\n |\n| 5 | Roswell | Chaves | 47,775\n |\n| 6 | Farmington | San Juan | 45,450\n |\n| 7 | Clovis | Curry | 38,962\n |\n| 8 | Hobbs | Lea | 37,764\n |\n| 9 | Alamogordo | Otero | 31,248\n |\n| 10 | Carlsbad | Eddy | 28,774\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Delaware Basin\n* List of counties in New Mexico\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present.
