atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.\n\n\nIn structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.[9] Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors.[9] When added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron, or nickel, beryllium improves many physical properties.[9] For example, tools and components made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In air, the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer 1–10 nm thick that protects it from further oxidation and corrosion. The metal oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer) when heated above 500 °C (932 °F), and burns brilliantly when heated to about 2,500 °C (4,530 °F).\n\n\nThe commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis.[10] Berylliosis causes pneumonia and other associated respiratory illness.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\nBeryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure.[9] It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a melting point of 1287 °C. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 35% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9 km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.[11]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear properties[edit]\n\n\nNaturally occurring beryllium, save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes, is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a nuclear spin of 3/2. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower; the exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.\n\n\nThe single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce 8Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:[12]\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + n → 2 4  \n2He  \n + 2 n\nNeutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles[11] producing the nuclear reaction\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + 4  \n2He  \n → 12  \n6C  \n + n\nwhere 4  \n2He  \n is an alpha particle and 12  \n6C  \n is a carbon-12 nucleus.[12]\nBeryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons.\n\n\nSmall amounts of tritium are liberated when 9  \n4Be  \n nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step nuclear reaction\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + n → 4  \n2He  \n + 6  \n2He  \n,    6  \n2He  \n → 6  \n3Li  \n + β−,    6  \n3Li  \n + n → 4  \n2He  \n + 3  \n1H  \n\n6  \n2He  \n has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds, β− is an electron, and 6  \n3Li  \n has a high neutron absorption cross section. Tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams.[13]\n\n\n\n### Optical properties[edit]\n\n\nAs a metal, beryllium is transparent or translucent to most wavelengths of X-rays and gamma rays, making it useful for the output windows of X-ray tubes and other such apparatus.[14]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes and nucleosynthesis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of beryllium\n\nBoth stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.[15] Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic and mononuclidic element.\n\n\n\n![](image)Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in sunspot number (red) and 10Be concentration (blue). Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower 10Be levels\nRadioactive cosmogenic 10Be is produced in the atmosphere of the Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen.[16] 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores.[17] The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth.[16] Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.[18]\nThe isotope 7Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like 10Be.\n\n\n8Be has a very short half-life of about 8×10−17 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the Big Bang.[19] This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the fusion of 4He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium-8. British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle first showed that the energy levels of 8Be and 12C allow carbon production by the so-called triple-alpha process in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of carbon-based life) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by AGB stars and supernovae (see also Big Bang nucleosynthesis), as well as the creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon.[20]\n\n\nThe 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-electron capture, it does so by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings – a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.[21]\n\n\nThe shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is 16Be, which decays through neutron emission with a half-life of 6.5×10−22 s.[22] The exotic isotopes 11Be and 14Be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.[23] This phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of 11Be and 14Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.\n\n\n\n### Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beryllium ore with 1US¢ coin for scale\n![](image)Emerald is a naturally occurring compound of beryllium.\nThe Sun has a concentration of 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) of beryllium.[24] Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust.[25] It is most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm.[26] Trace amounts of 9Be are found in the Earth's atmosphere.[26] The concentration of beryllium in sea water is 0.2–0.6 parts per trillion.[26][27] In stream water, however, beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of 0.1 ppb.[28]\n\n\nBeryllium is found in over 100 minerals,[29] but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be4Si2O7(OH)2), beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), chrysoberyl (Al2BeO4) and phenakite (Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald.[11][30][31] \nThe green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).[32]\n\n\nThe two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States.[32] Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.[32]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nThe extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. Currently the United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium.[33] Kazakhstan produces beryllium from a concentrate stockpiled before the breakup of the Soviet Union around 1991. This resource had become nearly depleted by mid-2010s.[34]\n\n\nProduction of beryllium in Russia was halted in 1997, and is planned to be resumed in the 2020s.[35][36]\n\n\nBeryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral beryl, which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at 770 °C (1,420 °F) to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide.[9] Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1,650 °C (3,000 °F).[9] The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300 °C (482 to 572 °F) in concentrated sulfuric acid, mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate.[9] Aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.\n\n\nBeryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to 1,000 °C (1,830 °F) to form beryllium fluoride.[9] Heating the fluoride to 900 °C (1,650 °F) with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium, and additional heating to 1,300 °C (2,370 °F) creates the compact metal.[9] Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine. Electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.[9]\n\n\n\n## Chemical properties[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Beryllium compounds\n\nA beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s2. The predominant oxidation state of beryllium is +2; the beryllium atom has lost both of its valence electrons. Lower oxidation states complexes of beryllium are exceedingly rare. For example, bis(carbene) compounds proposed to contain beryllium in the 0- and +1-oxidation state have been reported, although these claims have proved controversial.[37][38]\nA stable complex with a Be-Be bond, which formally features beryllium in the +1 oxidation state, has been described.[39] Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. Its chemistry has similarities to that of aluminium, an example of a diagonal relationship.\n\n\nAt room temperature, the surface of beryllium forms a 1−10 nm-thick oxide passivation layer that prevents further reactions with air, except for gradual thickening of the oxide up to about 25 nm. When heated above about 500 °C, oxidation into the bulk metal progresses along grain boundaries.[40] Once the metal is ignited in air by heating above the oxide melting point around 2500 °C, beryllium burns brilliantly, forming a mixture of beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.[9][41]\n\n\nBinary compounds of beryllium(II) are polymeric in the solid state. BeF2 has a silica-like structure with corner-shared BeF4 tetrahedra. BeCl2 and BeBr2 have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. Beryllium oxide, BeO, is a white refractory solid, which has the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Beryllium sulfide, selenide and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.[42] Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 has a similar structure to Be3N2. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane.[42] No beryllium silicide has been identified.[41]\n\n\nThe halides BeX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.[41] Complexes of the halides are formed with one or more ligands donating at total of two pairs of electrons. Such compounds obey the octet rule. Other 4-coordinate complexes such as the aqua-ion [Be(H2O)4]2+ also obey the octet rule.\n\n\n\n### Aqueous solutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schematic structure of basic beryllium acetate\n![](image)Beryllium hydrolysis. Water molecules attached to Be are omitted in this diagram\n![](image)Structure of the trimeric hydrolysis product of beryllium(II)\nSolutions of beryllium salts, such as beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate, are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H2O)4]2+ ion. The concentration of the first hydrolysis product, [Be(H2O)3(OH)]+, is less than 1% of the beryllium concentration. The most stable hydrolysis product is the trimeric ion [Be3(OH)3(H2O)6]3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble in water at pH 5 or more. Consequently, beryllium compounds are generally insoluble at biological pH. Because of this, inhalation of beryllium metal dust by people leads to the development of the fatal condition of berylliosis. Be(OH)2 dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.[43]\n\n\nBeryllium(II) forms few complexes with monodentate ligands because the water molecules in the aquo-ion, [Be(H2O)4]2+ are bound very strongly to the beryllium ion. Notable exceptions are the series of water-soluble complexes with the fluoride ion:[44] [\nBe\n\n\n(\n\nH\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n)\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n↽\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n⇀\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe\n\n\n[\n\n\n(\n\nH\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\ce {[Be(H2O)4]^{2}+{}+{\\mathit {n}}\\,F^{-}<=>Be[(H2O)\\_{2\\!-{\\mathit {n}}}F\\_{\\mathit {n}}]^{2\\!-{\\mathit {n}}}{}+{\\mathit {n}}\\,H2O}}}\n![{\\displaystyle {\\ce {[Be(H2O)4]^{2}+{}+{\\mathit {n}}\\,F^{-}<=>Be[(H2O)_{2\\!-{\\mathit {n}}}F_{\\mathit {n}}]^{2\\!-{\\mathit {n}}}{}+{\\mathit {n}}\\,H2O}}}](image)\n\n\n\nBeryllium(II) forms many complexes with bidentate ligands containing oxygen-donor atoms.[43] The species [Be3O(H2PO4)6]2- is notable for having a 3-coordinate oxide ion at its center.

For example, log K1 and log K2 values of 12.2 and 9.3 have been reported for complexes with tiron.[45][47]\n\n\nBeryllium has generally a rather poor affinity for ammine ligands.[45][48] Ligands such as EDTA behave as dicarboxylic acids.[*citation needed*] There are many early reports of complexes with amino acids, but unfortunately they are not reliable as the concomitant hydrolysis reactions were not understood at the time of publication. Values for log β of ca. 6 to 7 have been reported. The degree of formation is small because of competition with hydrolysis reactions.[45][48]\n\n\n\n### Organic chemistry[edit]\n\n\nOrganoberyllium chemistry is limited to academic research due to the cost and toxicity of beryllium, beryllium derivatives and reagents required for the introduction of beryllium, such as beryllium chloride. Organometallic beryllium compounds are known to be highly reactive[49] Examples of known organoberyllium compounds are *dineopentylberyllium*,[50] *beryllocene* (Cp2Be),[51][52][53][54] *diallylberyllium* (by exchange reaction of diethyl beryllium with triallyl boron),[55] bis(1,3-trimethylsilylallyl)beryllium,[56] Be(mes)2,[49] and (beryllium(I) complex) *diberyllocene*.[39] Ligands can also be aryls[57] and alkynyls.[58]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe mineral beryl, which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.[59] In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia *Natural History* that beryl and emerald (\"smaragdus\") were similar.[60] The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin discovered beryllium\nEarly analyses of emeralds and beryls by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Torbern Olof Bergman, Franz Karl Achard, and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the mistaken conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates.[61] Mineralogist René Just Haüy discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin for a chemical analysis.[59]\n\n\nIn a 1798 paper read before the Institut de France, Vauquelin reported that he found a new \"earth\" by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali.[62] The editors of the journal *Annales de Chimie et de Physique* named the new earth \"glucine\" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.[63] Klaproth preferred the name \"beryllina\" due to the fact that yttria also formed sweet salts.[64][65] The name \"beryllium\" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Friedrich Wöhler was one of the men who independently isolated beryllium\nFriedrich Wöhler[67] and Antoine Bussy[68] independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride, as follows:\n\n\n\nBeCl2 + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be\nUsing an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster.[69] The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.\n\n\nThe direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul Lebeau in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium.[69] However, industrial production started only after the First World War. The original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, and Siemens & Halske AG in Berlin. In the US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt.[70]\n\n\nA sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron.[32] This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.[25]\n\n\nBeryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.[71]\n\n\nElectrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.[72]\n\n\nPure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.[32] Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently, most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium.[73] The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.[74]\n\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes. It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nNamed after beryl, a semiprecious mineral, from which it was first isolated.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n### Radiation windows[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beryllium target which converts a proton beam into a neutron beam\n![](image)A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an X-ray microscope. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low atomic number.\nBecause of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes.[32] Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (≈100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.[11]\n\n\nLow atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb),[80] the Tevatron and at SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.[81]\n\n\n\n### Mechanical applications[edit]\n\n\nBecause of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites, including the James Webb Space Telescope. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium.[82][83] Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized.[32] A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium.[84] From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons.[85] The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.[86]\n\n\nMixing about 2.0% beryllium into copper forms an alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone.[87] Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance.[32][9] These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices.[32][9] As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Beryllium copper adjustable wrench\nThe high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in inertial guidance systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems.[11] Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in \"Jason pistols\", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.[88]\n\n\nBeryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.[89]\n\n\nAn earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.[11]\n\n\nTo reduce costs, beryllium can be alloyed with significant amounts of aluminium, resulting in the AlBeMet alloy (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable properties.\n\n\n\n### Mirrors[edit]\n\n\nBeryllium mirrors are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.[11]\n\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors, each plated with a thin layer of gold.[90] Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures.[91] For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.[92]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic applications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A hollow beryllium sphere used in a gyrocompass of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress aircraft[93]\nBeryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes.[94] They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated.[95] In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear applications[edit]\n\n\nThin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of the plutonium pits in the primary stages of thermonuclear bombs, placed to surround the fissile material. These layers of beryllium are good \"pushers\" for the implosion of the plutonium-239, and they are good neutron reflectors, just as in beryllium-moderated nuclear reactors.[96]\n\n\nBeryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a particle accelerator-powered neutron generator). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium-210, radium-226, plutonium-238, or americium-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources, named \"urchin\" neutron initiators, were used in some early atomic bombs.[96] Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two CANDU fuel bundles: Each about 50 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter. Notice the small appendages on the fuel clad surfaces\nBeryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for CANDU reactors. The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the braze filler material. Bearing pads are brazed in place to prevent contact between the fuel bundle and the pressure tube containing it, and inter-element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact.\n\n\nBeryllium is also used at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion research laboratory, and it will be used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma.[98] Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties.[11] Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).[99]\n\n\n\n### Acoustics[edit]\n\n\nThe low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home,[100][101][102] pro audio, and public address applications.[103][104] Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to be made of the material.[105]\n\n\nSome high-end phonograph cartridges used beryllium cantilevers to improve tracking by reducing mass.[106]\n\n\n\n### Electronic[edit]\n\n\nBeryllium is a p-type dopant in III-V compound semiconductors. It is widely used in materials such as GaAs, AlGaAs, InGaAs and InAlAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).[107] Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface-mount technology. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and heat sink. The application also requires a coefficient of thermal expansion that is well matched to the alumina and polyimide-glass substrates. The beryllium-beryllium oxide composite \"E-Materials\" have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.[11]\n\n\nBeryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets.[108] Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.[109]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nBeryllium is a component of several dental alloys.[110][111]\n\n\n\n## Toxicity and safety[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Acute beryllium poisoning and Berylliosis\n\n\n\n\nBeryllium\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:[112] |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS06: Toxic](image) ![GHS08: Health hazard](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Danger** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H301, H315, H317, H319, H330, H335, H350i, H372 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P201, P202, P280, P302, P304, P305+P351+P338, P310, P340, P352 |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | ![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n4\n3\n3\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\n### Biological effects[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 35 micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful.[113] Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction.[113] Because Be2+ is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body, beryllium cannot be removed.[114]\n\n\n\n### Inhalation[edit]\n\n\nChronic beryllium disease (CBD), or berylliosis, is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled.[113] The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as Category 1 carcinogens.[115]\n\n\n\n### Occupational exposure[edit]\n\n\nIn the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for beryllium and beryllium compounds of 0.2 µg/m3 as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) and 2.0 µg/m3 as a short-term exposure limit over a sampling period of 15 minutes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) upper-bound threshold of 0.5 µg/m3. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4 mg/m3.[116] The toxicity of beryllium is on par with other toxic metalloids/metals, such as arsenic and mercury.[117][118]\n\n\nExposure to beryllium in the workplace can lead to a sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease.[119] The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration.[119]\n\n\nAcute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.[120] Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.[121]\n\n\nBeryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.[122]\n\n\nAlthough the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.[123]\n\n\n\n### Detection[edit]\n\n\nEarly researchers undertook the highly hazardous practice of identifying beryllium and its various compounds from its sweet taste. Identification is now performed using safe modern diagnostics techniques.[9] A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium in minute concentrations (ASTM D7458).[124][125] The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.[126]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Beryllium\".

Therefore, in order to avoid confusion of it with yttria-earth, it would perhaps be advisable to abandon this name *glycine* and replace it with beryl-earth (*beryllina*); which name change was also recommended by Prof. Link, and for the reason that a genus of plants, *Glycine*, already exists.)\n65. **^** Weeks 1968, p. 538.\n66. **^** Wöhler, F.

*(*líthos*)* 'stone') is a chemical element; it has symbol **Li** and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\n\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.[7] For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.[8]\n\n\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.[*citation needed*][*when?*]\n\n\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function. Lithium-based drugs are useful as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant in the treatment of mental illness such as bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\n\n### Atomic and physical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lithium ingots with a thin layer of black nitride tarnish\nThe alkali metals are also called the lithium family, after its leading element. Like the other alkali metals (which are sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)), lithium has a single valence electron that, in the presence of solvents, is easily released to form Li+.[9] Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).[9] Molten lithium is significantly more reactive than its solid form.[10][11]\n\n\nLithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide.[9] Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F)[12] and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F)[12] are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest.\n\n\nLithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood.[13] It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3).[14] Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium floating in oil\nLithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron.[15] Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure[16] and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa).[17] At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent.[18] Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.[19]\n\n\nLithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids.[20][21] Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications.[20]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of lithium\n\nNaturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance).[22][23] Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3.[24] As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements.[7] Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.[25] The 6Li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, the other four stable odd-odd nuclides being hydrogen-2, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m.[26]\n\n\n7Li is one of the primordial elements (or, more properly, primordial nuclides) produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis. A small amount of both 6Li and 7Li are produced in stars during stellar nucleosynthesis, but it is further \"burned\" as fast as produced.[27] 7Li can also be generated in carbon stars.[28] Additional small amounts of both 6Li and 7Li may be generated from solar wind, cosmic rays hitting heavier atoms, and from early solar system 7Be radioactive decay.[29]\n\n\nLithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes,[30] including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a neutron halo, with 2 neutrons orbiting around its nucleus of 3 protons and 6 neutrons. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.[31]\n\n\nNuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.[32]\n\n\nBoth stable isotopes of lithium can be laser cooled and were used to produce the first quantum degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture.[33]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lithium is about as common as chlorine in the Earth's upper continental crust, on a per-atom basis.\n### Astronomical[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Nucleosynthesis, Stellar nucleosynthesis, and Lithium burning\n\nAlthough it was synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium (together with beryllium and boron) is markedly less abundant in the universe than other elements. This is a result of the comparatively low stellar temperatures necessary to destroy lithium, along with a lack of common processes to produce it.[34]\n\n\nAccording to modern cosmological theory, lithium—in both stable isotopes (lithium-6 and lithium-7)—was one of the three elements synthesized in the Big Bang.[35] Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon, for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated, and there is a \"cosmological lithium discrepancy\" in the universe: older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have much more.[36] The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the \"mixing\" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed,[37] while lithium is produced in younger stars. Although it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than computations would predict in later-generation stars.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nova Centauri 2013 is the first in which evidence of lithium has been found.[39]\nLithium is also found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars. Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the \"lithium test\" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun.[38][40][41] Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium. Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium (such as Centaurus X-4) orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed.[38]\n\n\nOn 27 May 2020, astronomers reported that classical nova explosions are galactic producers of lithium-7.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lithium compounds and Lithium minerals\n\nAlthough lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity.[9] The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm),[44][45] or 25 micromolar;[46] higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.[45]\n\n\nEstimates for the Earth's crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight.[47] Lithium constitutes about 0.002 percent of Earth's crust.[48] In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, with the largest concentrations in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources.[47] Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite which is now an obsolete name for a series formed by polylithionite and trilithionite.[49][50] Another source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States.[51] At 20 mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust,[52] lithium is the 25th most abundant element.\n\n\nAccording to the *Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium*, \"Lithium is a comparatively rare element, although it is found in many rocks and some brines, but always in very low concentrations. There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value. Many are very small, others are too low in grade.\"[53]\n\n\nChile is estimated (2020) to have the largest reserves by far (9.2 million tonnes),[54] and Australia the highest annual production (40,000 tonnes).[54] One of the largest *reserve bases*[note 1] of lithium is in the Salar de Uyuni area of Bolivia, which has 5.4 million tonnes. Other major suppliers include Australia, Argentina and China.[55][56] As of 2015, the Czech Geological Survey considered the entire Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic as lithium province. Five deposits are registered, one near Cínovec [cs] is considered as a potentially economical deposit, with 160 000 tonnes of lithium.[57] In December 2019, Finnish mining company Keliber Oy reported its Rapasaari lithium deposit has estimated proven and probable ore reserves of 5.280 million tonnes.[58]\n\n\nIn June 2010, *The New York Times* reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there.[59] These estimates are \"based principally on old data, which was gathered mainly by the Soviets during their occupation of Afghanistan from 1979–1989\".[60] The Department of Defense estimated the lithium reserves in Afghanistan to amount to the ones in Bolivia and dubbed it as a potential \"Saudi-Arabia of lithium\".[61] In Cornwall, England, the presence of brine rich in lithium was well known due to the region's historic mining industry, and private investors have conducted tests to investigate potential lithium extraction in this area.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Biological[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Potassium in biology, Sodium in biology, and Soil salinity\n\nLithium is found in trace amount in numerous plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb.[45] Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms.[64] Whether lithium has a physiological role in any of these organisms is unknown.[45]\nLithium concentrations in human tissue averages about 24 ppb (4 ppb in blood, and 1.3 ppm in bone).[65]\n\n\nLithium is easily absorbed by plants[65] and lithium concentration in plant tissue is typically around 1 ppm.[66] Some plant families bioaccumulate more lithium than others.[66] Dry weight lithium concentrations for members of the family Solanaceae (which includes potatoes and tomatoes), for instance, can be as high as 30 ppm while this can be as low as 0.05 ppb for corn grains.[65]\nStudies of lithium concentrations in mineral-rich soil give ranges between around 0.1 and 50−100 ppm, with some concentrations as high as 100−400 ppm, although it is unlikely that all of it is available for uptake by plants.[66]\nLithium accumulation does not appear to affect the essential nutrient composition of plants.[66] Tolerance to lithium varies by plant species and typically parallels sodium tolerance; maize and Rhodes grass, for example, are highly tolerant to lithium injury while avocado and soybean are very sensitive.[66] Similarly, lithium at concentrations of 5 ppm reduces seed germination in some species (e.g. Asian rice and chickpea) but not in others (e.g. barley and wheat).[66]\n\n\nMany of lithium's major biological effects can be explained by its competition with other ions.[67]\nThe monovalent lithium ion Li+  \n competes with other ions such as sodium (immediately below lithium on the periodic table), which like lithium is also a monovalent alkali metal.\nLithium also competes with bivalent magnesium ions, whose ionic radius (86 pm) is approximately that of the lithium ion[67] (90 pm).\nMechanisms that transport sodium across cellular membranes also transport lithium.\nFor instance, sodium channels (both voltage-gated and epithelial) are particularly major pathways of entry for lithium.[67]\nLithium ions can also permeate through ligand-gated ion channels as well as cross both nuclear and mitochondrial membranes.[67]\nLike sodium, lithium can enter and partially block (although not permeate) potassium channels and calcium channels.[67]\nThe biological effects of lithium are many and varied but its mechanisms of action are only partially understood.[68]\nFor instance, studies of lithium-treated patients with bipolar disorder show that, among many other effects, lithium partially reverses telomere shortening in these patients and also increases mitochondrial function, although how lithium produces these pharmacological effects is not understood.[68][69]\nEven the exact mechanisms involved in lithium toxicity are not fully understood.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johan August Arfwedson is credited with the discovery of lithium in 1817\nPetalite (LiAlSi4O10) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist and statesman José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden.[70][71][72][73] However, it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.[74][75][76][77] This element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and less alkaline.[78] Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name \"*lithion*/*lithina*\", from the Greek word *λιθoς* (transliterated as *lithos*, meaning \"stone\"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material \"lithium\".[9][72][77]\n\n\nArwedson later showed that this same element was present in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite.[79][72] In 1818, Christian Gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame.[72][80] However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts.[72][77][81] It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium.[38][81][82][83][84] Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol).[85] In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen.[72][86] The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.[72][87][88]\n\n\nAustralian psychiatrist John Cade is credited with reintroducing and popularizing the use of lithium to treat mania in 1949.[89] Shortly after, throughout the mid 20th century, lithium's mood stabilizing applicability for mania and depression took off in Europe and the United States.\n\n\nThe production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use was supported by the fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.\n\n\nThe demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some \"natural sources\" of lithium ion which had been \"contaminated\" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.[32][90]\n\n\n\n![alt1](image)\n![alt2](image)\nSatellite images of the Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina (left), and Uyuni, Bolivia (right), salt flats that are rich in lithium. The lithium-rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds (visible in the left image).\n\nLithium is used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide in the Hall-Héroult process.[91][92] These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of department of energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices.[90] In the mid-1990s, several companies started to isolate lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive option than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.\n\n\nThe development of lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007.[93] With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s, new companies have expanded brine isolation efforts to meet the rising demand.[94][95]\n\n\nIt has been argued that lithium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy and dependent on batteries, but this perspective has also been criticised for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production.[96]\n\n\n\n## Chemistry[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Lithium compounds\n\n\"Lithium salt\" redirects here. For Lithium salts used in medication, see Lithium (medication).\n\n### Of lithium metal[edit]\n\n\nLithium reacts with water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide.[9] When placed over a flame, lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color, but when the metal burns strongly, the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapor. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).[47] Lithium is one of the few metals that react with nitrogen gas.[97][98]\n\n\nBecause of its reactivity with water, and especially nitrogen, lithium metal is usually stored in a hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Although the heavier alkali metals can be stored under mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to fully submerge itself in these liquids.[38]\n\n\nLithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium, an element of similar atomic and ionic radius. Chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride by reaction with N2, the formation of an oxide (Li  \n2O) and peroxide (Li  \n2O  \n2) when burnt in O2, salts with similar solubilities, and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides.[47][99] The metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce lithium hydride (LiH).[100]\n\n\nLithium forms a variety of binary and ternary materials by direct reaction with the main group elements. These Zintl phases, although highly covalent, can be viewed as salts of polyatomic anions such as Si44-, P73-, and Te52-. With graphite, lithium forms a variety of intercalation compounds.[99]\n\n\nIt dissolves in ammonia (and amines) to give [Li(NH3)4]+ and the solvated electron.[99]\n\n\n\n### Inorganic compounds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hexameric structure of the n-butyllithium fragment in a crystal\nLithium forms salt-like derivatives with all halides and pseudohalides. Some examples include the halides LiF, LiCl, LiBr, LiI, as well as the pseudohalides and related anions. Lithium carbonate has been described as the most important compound of lithium.[99] This white solid is the principal product of beneficiation of lithium ores. It is a precursor to other salts including ceramics and materials for lithium batteries.\n\n\nThe compounds LiBH  \n4 and LiAlH  \n4 are useful reagents. These salts and many other lithium salts exhibit distinctively high solubility in ethers, in contrast with salts of heavier alkali metals.\n\n\nIn aqueous solution, the coordination complex [Li(H2O)4]+ predominates for many lithium salts. Related complexes are known with amines and ethers.\n\n\n\n### Organic chemistry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Organolithium reagent\n\nOrganolithium compounds are numerous and useful. They are defined by the presence of a bond between carbon and lithium. They serve as metal-stabilized carbanions, although their solution and solid-state structures are more complex than this simplistic view.[101] Thus, these are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry. For laboratory organic synthesis, many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form. These reagents are highly reactive, and are sometimes pyrophoric.\n\n\nLike its inorganic compounds, almost all organic compounds of lithium formally follow the duet rule (e.g., BuLi, MeLi). However, it is important to note that in the absence of coordinating solvents or ligands, organolithium compounds form dimeric, tetrameric, and hexameric clusters (e.g., BuLi is actually [BuLi]6 and MeLi is actually [MeLi]4) which feature multi-center bonding and increase the coordination number around lithium. These clusters are broken down into smaller or monomeric units in the presence of solvents like dimethoxyethane (DME) or ligands like tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA).[102] As an exception to the duet rule, a two-coordinate lithate complex with four electrons around lithium, [Li(thf)4]+[((Me3Si)3C)2Li]–, has been characterized crystallographically.[103]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries by lithium production\n\n\n\nLithium mine production (2022), reserves and resources in tonnes according to USGS[54]\n| Country\n | Production\n | Reserves[note 1] | Resources\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina | 6,200\n | 2,700,000\n | 20,000,000\n |\n| Australia | 61,000\n | 6,200,000\n | 7,900,000\n |\n| Austria | -\n | -\n | 60,000\n |\n| Bolivia | -\n | -\n | 21,000,000\n |\n| Brazil | 2,200\n | 250,000\n | 730,000\n |\n| Canada | 500\n | 930,000\n | 2,900,000\n |\n| Chile | 39,000\n | 9,300,000\n | 11,000,000\n |\n| China | 19,000\n | 2,000,000\n | 6,800,000\n |\n| Czech Republic | -\n | -\n | 1,300,000\n |\n| DR Congo | -\n | -\n | 3,000,000\n |\n| Finland | -\n | -\n | 68,000\n |\n| Germany | -\n | -\n | 3,200,000\n |\n| Ghana | -\n | -\n | 180,000\n |\n| India | -\n | -\n | 5,900,000[104][105] |\n| Kazakhstan | -\n | -\n | 50,000\n |\n| Mali | -\n | -\n | 840,000\n |\n| Mexico | -\n | -\n | 1,700,000\n |\n| Namibia | -\n | -\n | 230,000\n |\n| Peru | -\n | -\n | 880,000\n |\n| Portugal | 600\n | 60,000\n | 270,000\n |\n| Russia | -\n | -\n | 1,000,000\n |\n| Serbia | -\n | -\n | 1,200,000\n |\n| Spain | -\n | -\n | 320,000\n |\n| United States | 870[note 2] | 1,000,000\n | 12,000,000\n |\n| Zimbabwe | 800\n | 310,000\n | 690,000\n |\n| **World total** | **130,000** | **26,000,000** | **98,000,000+** |\n\n\nLithium production has greatly increased since the end of World War II. The main sources of lithium are brines and ores.\n\n\nLithium metal is produced through electrolysis applied to a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450 °C.[106]\n\n\n\n### Reserves and occurrence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scatter plots of lithium grade and tonnage for selected world deposits, as of 2017\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated worldwide identified lithium reserves in 2020 and 2021 to be 17 million and 21 million tonnes, respectively.[55][54] An accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult.[107][108] One reason for this is that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects.[109]\n\n\nIn 2019, world production of lithium from spodumene was around 80,000t per annum, primarily from the Greenbushes pegmatite and from some Chinese and Chilean sources. The Talison mine in Greenbushes is reported to be the largest and to have the highest grade of ore at 2.4% Li2O (2012 figures).[110]\n\n\n\n#### Lithium triangle and other brine sources[edit]\n\n\nThe world's top four lithium-producing countries from 2019, as reported by the US Geological Survey are Australia, Chile, China and Argentina.[55]\n\n\nThe three countries of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina contain a region known as the Lithium Triangle. The Lithium Triangle is known for its high-quality salt flats, which include Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni, Chile's Salar de Atacama, and Argentina's Salar de Arizaro. The Lithium Triangle is believed to contain over 75% of existing known lithium reserves.[111] Deposits are also found in South America throughout the Andes mountain chain. Chile is the leading producer, followed by Argentina. Both countries recover lithium from brine pools. According to USGS, Bolivia's Uyuni Desert has 5.4 million tonnes of lithium.[112][113] Half the world's known reserves are located in Bolivia along the central eastern slope of the Andes. The Bolivian government has invested US$900 million and in 2021 successfully produced 540 tons[114][112] The brines in the salt pans of the Lithium Triangle vary widely in lithium content.[115] Concentrations can also vary in time as brines are fluids that are changeable and mobile.[115]\n\n\nIn the US, lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Hard-rock deposits[edit]\n\n\nSince 2018 the Democratic Republic of Congo is known to have the largest lithium spodumene hard-rock deposit in the world.[116] The deposit located in Manono, DRC, may hold up to 1.5 billion tons of lithium spodumene hard-rock. The two largest pegmatites (known as the Carriere de l'Este Pegmatite and the Roche Dure Pegmatite) are each of similar size or larger than the famous Greenbushes Pegmatite in Western Australia. Thus, the Democratic Republic of Congo is expected to be a significant supplier of lithium to the world with its high grade and low impurities.\n\n\nOn 16 July 2018 2.5 million tonnes of high-grade lithium resources and 124 million pounds of uranium resources were found in the Falchani hard rock deposit in the region Puno, Peru.[117]\nIn 2020, Australia granted Major Project Status (MPS) to the Finniss Lithium Project for a strategically important lithium deposit: an estimated 3.45 million tonnes (Mt) of mineral resource at 1.4 percent lithium oxide.[118][119] Operational mining began in 2022.[120]\n\n\nA deposit discovered in 2013 in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated to contain 228,000 tons.[*clarification needed*] Additional deposits in the same formation were estimated to be as much as 18 million tons.[121] Similarly in Nevada, the McDermitt Caldera hosts lithium-bearing volcanic muds that consist of the largest known deposits of lithium within the United States.[122]\n\n\nThe Pampean Pegmatite Province in Argentina is known to have a total of at least 200,000 tons of spodumene with lithium oxide (Li2O) grades varying between 5 and 8 wt.%.[123]\n\n\nIn Russia the largest lithium deposit Kolmozerskoye is located in Murmansk region. In 2023, Polar Lithium, a joint venture between Nornickel and Rosatom, has been granted the right to develop the deposit. The project aims to produce 45,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate and hydroxide per year and plans to reach full design capacity by 2030.[124]\n\n\n\n### Sources[edit]\n\n\nAnother potential source of lithium as of 2012[update] was identified as the leachates of geothermal wells, which are carried to the surface.[125] Recovery of this type of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple filtration.[126][*clarification needed*] Reserves are more limited than those of brine reservoirs and hard rock.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Pricing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lithium prices\nIn 1998, the price of lithium metal was about 95 USD/kg (or US$43/lb).[127] After the 2007 financial crisis, major suppliers, such as Sociedad Química y Minera (SQM), dropped lithium carbonate pricing by 20%.[128] Prices rose in 2012. A 2012 Business Week article outlined an oligopoly in the lithium space: \"SQM, controlled by billionaire Julio Ponce, is the second-largest, followed by Rockwood, which is backed by Henry Kravis's KKR & Co., and Philadelphia-based FMC\", with Talison mentioned as the biggest producer.[129] Global consumption may jump to 300,000 metric tons a year by 2020[*failed verification*] from about 150,000 tons in 2012, to match the demand for lithium batteries that has been growing at about 25% a year, outpacing the 4% to 5% overall gain in lithium production.[129][*needs update*]\n\n\nThe price information service ISE - Institute of Rare Earths Elements and Strategic Metals - gives for various lithium substances in the average of the last six months (March to August 2022) the following kilo prices stable in the course: Lithium Carbonate, purity 99.5%min, from various producers between 63 and 72 EUR/kg. Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate LiOH 56.5%min, China, at 66 to 72 EUR/kg; Delivered South Korea - 73 EUR/kg. Lithium Metal 99.9%min, Delivered China - 42 EUR/kg.[130]\n\n\n\n### Extraction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Analyses of the extraction of lithium from seawater, published in 1975\nLithium and its compounds were historically isolated and extracted from hard rock but by the 1990s mineral springs, brine pools, and brine deposits had become the dominant source.[*citation needed*] Most of these were in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia.[54] Large lithium-clay deposits under development in the McDermitt caldera (Nevada, United States) require concentrated sulfuric acid to leach lithium from the clay ore.[131]\n\n\nBy early 2021, much of the lithium mined globally comes from either \"spodumene, the mineral contained in hard rocks found in places such as Australia and North Carolina\"[132] or from the salty brine pumped directly out of the ground, as it is in locations in Chile.[132][115] In Chile's Salar de Atacama, the lithium concentration in the brine is raised by solar evaporation in a system of ponds.[115] The enrichment by evaporation process may require up to one-and-a-half years, when the brine reaches a lithium content of 6%.[115] The final processing in this example is done near the city of Antofagasta on the coast where pure lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and lithium chloride are produced from the brine.[115]\n\n\nLow-cobalt cathodes for lithium batteries are expected to require lithium hydroxide rather than lithium carbonate as a feedstock, and this trend favors rock as a source.[133][134][135]\n\n\nOne method for lithium extraction, as well as other valuable minerals, is to process geothermal brine water through an electrolytic cell, located within a membrane.[136]\n\n\nThe use of electrodialysis and electrochemical intercalation has been proposed to extract lithium compounds from seawater (which contains lithium at 0.2 parts per million).[137][138][139][140] Ion-selective cells within a membrane in principle could collect lithium either by use of electric field or a concentration difference.[140]\n\n\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Environmental impacts of lithium-ion batteries\n\nThe manufacturing processes of lithium, including the solvent and mining waste, presents significant environmental and health hazards.[141][142][143]\nLithium extraction can be fatal to aquatic life due to water pollution.[144] It is known to cause surface water contamination, drinking water contamination, respiratory problems, ecosystem degradation and landscape damage.[141] It also leads to unsustainable water consumption in arid regions (1.9 million liters per ton of lithium).[141] Massive byproduct generation of lithium extraction also presents unsolved problems, such as large amounts of magnesium and lime waste.[145]\n\n\nIn the United States, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal mining competes with brine extraction mining.[146] Environmental concerns include wildlife habitat degradation, potable water pollution including arsenic and antimony contamination, unsustainable water table reduction, and massive mining waste, including radioactive uranium byproduct and sulfuric acid discharge.\n\n\n\n### Human rights issues[edit]\n\n\nA study of relationships between lithium extraction companies and indigenous peoples in Argentina indicated that the state may not have protected indigenous peoples' right to free prior and informed consent, and that extraction companies generally controlled community access to information and set the terms for discussion of the projects and benefit sharing.[147]\n\n\nDevelopment of the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, United States, has met with protests and lawsuits from several indigenous tribes who have said they were not provided free prior and informed consent and that the project threatens cultural and sacred sites.[148] They have also expressed concerns that development of the project will create risks to indigenous women, because resource extraction is linked to missing and murdered indigenous women.[149] Protestors have been occupying the site of the proposed mine since January, 2021.[150][146]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pie chart of how much lithium was used and in what way globally in 2020.[151] Ceramics and glass (18%)\n Batteries (65%)\n Lubricating greases (5%)\n Continuous casting (3%)\n Air treatment (1%)\n Polymers (3%)\n Primary aluminium production\n Pharmaceuticals\n Other (5%)\n\n### Batteries[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, most lithium is used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and mobile devices.\n\n\n\n### Ceramics and glass[edit]\n\n\nLithium oxide is widely used as a flux for processing silica, reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes with improved physical properties including low coefficients of thermal expansion. Worldwide, this is one of the largest use for lithium compounds.[152][153] Glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is generally used in this application because it converts to the oxide upon heating.[154]\n\n\n\n### Electrical and electronic[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: beyond concerns about only lithium carbonate in the second paragraph. Lithium carbonate is simply not close to the most economically interesting lithium++ battery chemistry by late in the 2010s. You can help by adding to it. *(March 2021)*\n |\n\n\nLate in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid and 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, differ from lithium metal batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.[155][156] Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.\n\n\nOver the years opinions have been differing about potential growth. A 2008 study concluded that \"realistically achievable lithium carbonate production would be sufficient for only a small fraction of future PHEV and EV global market requirements\", that \"demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade\", and that \"mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound, it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that LiIon propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the 'Green Car'\".[56]\n\n\n\n### Lubricating greases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lithium grease\n\nThe third most common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.[20][157][158]\n\n\n\n### Metallurgy[edit]\n\n\nLithium (e.g. as lithium carbonate) is used as an additive to continuous casting mould flux slags where it increases fluidity,[159][160] a use which accounts for 5% of global lithium use (2011).[55] Lithium compounds are also used as additives (fluxes) to foundry sand for iron casting to reduce veining.[161]\n\n\nLithium (as lithium fluoride) is used as an additive to aluminium smelters (Hall–Héroult process), reducing melting temperature and increasing electrical resistance,[162] a use which accounts for 3% of production (2011).[55]\n\n\nWhen used as a flux for welding or soldering, metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process[163] and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities.[164] Alloys of the metal with aluminium, cadmium, copper and manganese are used to make high-performance, low density aircraft parts (see also Lithium-aluminium alloys).[165]\n\n\n\n### Silicon nano-welding[edit]\n\n\nLithium has been found effective in assisting the perfection of silicon nano-welds in electronic components for electric batteries and other devices.[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium use in flares and pyrotechnics is due to its rose-red flame.[167]\n### Pyrotechnics[edit]\n\n\nLithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares.[20][168]\n\n\n\n### Air purification[edit]\n\n\nLithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams.[20] Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification. Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.\n\n\nLithium peroxide (Li2O2) in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate, but also releases oxygen.[169][170] The reaction is as follows:\n\n\n\n2 Li2O2 + 2 CO2 → 2 Li2CO3 + O2.\nSome of the aforementioned compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen. These can also include small amounts of boron, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, titanium, manganese, and iron.[171]\n\n\n\n### Optics[edit]\n\n\nLithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It has one of the lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials.[172] Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified.[173] Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.[20][174]\n\n\nThe high non-linearity of lithium niobate also makes it useful in non-linear optics applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.[175]\n\n\n\n### Organic and polymer chemistry[edit]\n\n\nOrganolithium compounds are widely used in the production of polymer and fine-chemicals. In the polymer industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators.[176] in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins.[177][178][179] For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.[180]\n\n\nMany other lithium compounds are used as reagents to prepare organic compounds. Some popular compounds include lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), lithium triethylborohydride, n-butyllithium and tert-butyllithium.\n\n\n\n![](image)The launch of a torpedo using lithium as fuel\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMetallic lithium and its complex hydrides, such as Li[AlH4], are used as high-energy additives to rocket propellants.[38] Lithium aluminium hydride can also be used by itself as a solid fuel.[181]\n\n\nThe Mark 50 torpedo stored chemical energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride, which is sprayed over a block of solid lithium. The reaction generates heat, creating steam to propel the torpedo in a closed Rankine cycle.[182]\n\n\nLithium hydride containing lithium-6 is used in thermonuclear weapons, where it serves as fuel for the fusion stage of the bomb.[183]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear[edit]\n\n\nLithium-6 is valued as a source material for tritium production and as a neutron absorber in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons.[184] Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium deuteride was used as fuel in the Castle Bravo nuclear device.\nLithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material.[186]\n\n\nLithium fluoride, when highly enriched in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic constituent of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF2 mixtures have low melting points. In addition, 7Li, Be, and F are among the few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.[note 3][187]\n\n\nIn conceptualized (hypothetical) nuclear fusion power plants, lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare, and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a 'blanket' containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium-tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium:\n\n\n\n6Li + n → 4He + 3H.\nLithium is also used as a source for alpha particles, or helium nuclei. When 7Li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8Be is formed, which almost immediately undergoes fission to form two alpha particles. This feat, called \"splitting the atom\" at the time, was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction. It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932.[188][189] Injection of lithium powders is used in fusion reactors to manipulate plasma-material interactions and dissipate energy in the hot thermo-nuclear fusion plasma boundary.[190][191]\n\n\nIn 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a shortage of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors \"places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk\". Castle Bravo first used lithium-7, in the *Shrimp*, its first device, which weighed only 10 tons, and generated massive nuclear atmospheric contamination of Bikini Atoll. This perhaps accounts for the decline of US nuclear infrastructure.[192] The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report said it would take five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.[193]\n\n\nReactors that use lithium-7 heat water under high pressure and transfer heat through heat exchangers that are prone to corrosion. The reactors use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of boric acid, which is added to the water to absorb excess neutrons.[193]\n\n\n\n### Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lithium (medication)\n\nLithium is useful in the treatment of bipolar disorder.[194] Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+.[194] Lithium may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.[195]\n\n\nA 2022 review indicated that lithium therapy during treatment of bipolar disorder does not affect body weight.[196]\n\n\n\n## Precautions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nLithium\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:\n |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS02: Flammable](image)![GHS05: Corrosive](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Danger** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H260, H314 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P223, P231+P232, P280, P305+P351+P338, P370+P378, P422[197] |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | [198]\n![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n3\n2\n2\nW\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\nLithium metal is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate the nose and throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.[199]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Cosmological lithium problem\n* Dilithium\n* Halo nucleus\n* Isotopes of lithium\n* List of countries by lithium production\n* Lithia water\n* Lithium–air battery\n* Lithium burning\n* Lithium compounds (category)\n* Lithium-ion battery\n* Lithium Tokamak Experiment\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appendixes Archived 6 November 2011 at the Wayback Machine.

chemical element; it has symbol **B** and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride.\n\n\nBoron is synthesized entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, so it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust.[11] It constitutes about 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust.[12] It is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.\n\n\nElemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids, but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, the very pure element is produced with difficulty because of contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal.[13] Several allotropes exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.\n\n\nBoron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all production consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and heat-resistant materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. As sodium perborate, it is used as a bleach. A small amount is used as a dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.\n\n\nThe intersection of boron with biology is very small. Consensus on it as essential for mammalian life is lacking. Borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt) but are more toxic to arthropods and are occasionally used as insecticides. Boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Although only traces are required, it is an essential plant nutrient.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe word *boron* was coined from *borax*, the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with *carbon*, which boron resembles chemically.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sassolite\nBorax in its mineral form (then known as tincal) first saw use as a glaze, beginning in China circa 300 AD. Some crude borax traveled westward, and was apparently mentioned by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan around 700 AD. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Georgius Agricola, in around 1600, reported the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, at which point it became known as *sal sedativum*, with ostensible medical benefits. The mineral was named sassolite, after Sasso Pisano in Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it.[14][15] Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.[16]\n\n\nBoron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy[10] and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard.[9] In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named it *boracium*.[10] Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is its oxidation product.[9][17] Jöns Jacob Berzelius identified it as an element in 1824.[18] Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest routes to elemental boron involved the reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals.[*citation needed*] Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified by the zone melting or Czochralski processes.[22]\n\n\nThe production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Allotropes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Allotropes of boron\n\n![](image)Boron chunks\nBoron is similar to carbon in its capability to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are bonded randomly to each other without long-range order.[23][24] Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000 °C. It forms four major allotropes: α-rhombohedral [25] and β-rhombohedral [26] (α-R and β-R), γ-orthorhombic [27] (γ) and β-tetragonal [28] (β-T). All four phases are stable at ambient conditions, and β-rhombohedral is the most common and stable. An α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but is very difficult to produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs.[29] It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20 GPa and heating to 1500–1800 °C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The β-T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200 °C. The α-T and β-T phases might coexist at ambient conditions, with the β-T phase being the more stable.[29][30][31] Compressing boron above 160 GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures below 6–12 K.[32] [33]Borospherene (fullerene-like B40 molecules) and borophene (proposed graphene-like structure) were described in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Boron phase\n | α-R\n | β-R\n | γ\n | β-T\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Symmetry\n | Rhombohedral | Rhombohedral | Orthorhombic | Tetragonal |\n| Atoms/unit cell[29] | 12\n | ~105\n | 28\n |  |\n| Density (g/cm3)[34][35][36][37] | 2.46\n | 2.35\n | 2.52\n | 2.36\n |\n| Vickers hardness (GPa)[38][39] | 42\n | 45\n | 50–58\n |  |\n| Bulk modulus (GPa)[39][40] | 185\n | 224\n | 227\n |  |\n| Bandgap (eV)[39][41] | 2\n | 1.6\n | 2.1\n |  |\n\n\n### Chemistry of the element[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Boron compounds\n\nElemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the pure material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies of \"boron\" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids.[20]\n\n\nThe rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide:[42]\n\n\n\n4 B + 3 O2 → 2 B2O3\n![](image)Ball-and-stick model of tetraborate anion, [B4O5(OH)4]2−, as it occurs in crystalline borax, Na2[B4O5(OH)4]·8H2O. Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp2 with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp3, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.\nBoron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides; for example,\n\n\n\n2 B + 3 Br2 → 2 BBr3\nThe trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Atomic structure[edit]\n\n\nBoron is the lightest element having an electron in a p-orbital in its ground state. Unlike most other p-elements, it rarely obeys the octet rule and usually places only six electrons[43] (in three molecular orbitals) onto its valence shell. Boron is the prototype for the boron group (the IUPAC group 13), although the other members of this group are metals and more typical p-elements (only aluminium to some extent shares boron's aversion to the octet rule).\n\n\nBoron also has much lower electronegativity than subsequent period 2 elements. For the latter, lithium salts are common e.g. lithium fluoride, lithium hydroxide, lithium amide, and methyllithium, but lithium boryllides are extraordinarily rare.[44][45] Strong bases do not deprotonate a borohydride R2BH to the boryl anion R2B−, instead forming the octet-complete adduct R2HB-base.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Chemical compounds[edit]\n\n\nMain article: boron compounds\n\n![](image)Boron (III) trifluoride structure, showing \"empty\" boron p orbital in pi-type coordinate covalent bonds\nIn the most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.[42]\n\n\nThe trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are Lewis acids in that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis bases. For example, fluoride (F−) and boron trifluoride (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4−. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.[42]\n\n\nIt is found in nature on Earth almost entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although it is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, boron minerals never contain it with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.[42] The tourmaline group of borate-silicates is also a very important boron-bearing mineral group, and a number of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally.[47]\n\n\n\n##### Boranes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boranes\n\n![](image)Ball-and-stick models showing the structures of the boron skeletons of borane clusters. The structures can be rationalised by polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory.[48]\nBoranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 are based on the fusion of two 10-atom clusters.\n\n\nThe most important boranes are diborane B2H6 and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B5H9 and decaborane B10H14. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. [B12H12]2−.\n\n\nThe formal oxidation number in boranes is positive, and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.\n\n\n\n##### Boron nitrides[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boron nitride\n\nThe boron nitrides are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbon atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.[49][50]\n\n\n\n##### Organoboron chemistry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Organoboron chemistry\n\nA large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in organic synthesis. Many are produced from hydroboration, which employs diborane, B2H6, a simple borane chemical, or carboboration. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, tetraphenylborate, [B(C6H5)4]− vs. triphenylborane, B(C6H5)3. However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.\n\n\nOrganoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as boron carbide (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to carboranes, carbon-boron cluster chemistry compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including carborane acid, a superacid. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for boron neutron capture therapy for cancer.\n\n\n\n##### Compounds of B(I) and B(II)[edit]\n\n\nAs anticipated by its hydride clusters, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 on each boron atom. Magnesium(II) ions lie between layers\nBinary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in negative oxidation states. Illustrative is magnesium diboride (MgB2). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of +2. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron, forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite. However, unlike hexagonal boron nitride, which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In 2001, this material was found to be a high-temperature superconductor.[52][53] It is a superconductor under active development. A project at CERN to make MgB2 cables has resulted in superconducting test cables able to carry 20,000 amperes for extremely high current distribution applications, such as the contemplated high luminosity version of the Large Hadron Collider.[54]\n\n\nCertain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.[55] Often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states, such as −1/3 in calcium hexaboride (CaB6).\n\n\nFrom the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B  \n12H2−  \n12), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.[42]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of boron\n\nBoron has two naturally occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron; the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay with a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and [B(OH)4]−. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [10B(OH)4]− ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.[56]\n\n\nThe exotic 17B exhibits a nuclear halo, i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model.[57]\n\n\nThe 10B isotope is useful for capturing thermal neutrons (see neutron cross section#Typical cross sections). The nuclear industry enriches natural boron to nearly pure 10B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure 11B.\n\n\n\n#### Commercial isotope enrichment[edit]\n\n\nBecause of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.[58] Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.[59][60]\n\n\n\n#### Enriched boron (boron-10)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neutron cross section of boron (top curve is for 10B and bottom curve for 11B)\nEnriched boron or 10B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in neutron capture therapy of cancer. In the latter (\"boron neutron capture therapy\" or BNCT), a compound containing 10B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it. The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose. The neutrons, however, trigger energetic and short-range secondary alpha particle and lithium-7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron-neutron nuclear reaction, and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor, especially from inside the tumor cells.[61][62][63][64]\n\n\nIn nuclear reactors, 10B is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function in the form of borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, 10B boric acid is added to the reactor coolant after the plant is shut down for refueling. When the plant is started up again, the boric acid is slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.[65]\n\n\nIn future crewed interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements, such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Depleted boron (boron-11)[edit]\n\n\n##### Radiation-hardened semiconductors[edit]\n\n\nCosmic radiation will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in 10B, if it is present in the spacecraft's semiconductors, producing a gamma ray, an alpha particle, and a lithium ion. Those resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor \"chip\" structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or single event upset). In radiation-hardened semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use *depleted boron*, which is greatly enriched in 11B and contains almost no 10B. This is useful because 11B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a byproduct of the nuclear industry (see above).[65]\n\n\n\n##### Proton-boron fusion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Proton-boron fusion\n\n11B is also a candidate as a fuel for aneutronic fusion. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500 keV, it produces three alpha particles and 8.7 MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long-term radioactivity, thereby endangering operating personnel. The alpha particles from 11B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.[67]\n\n\n\n#### NMR spectroscopy[edit]\n\n\nBoth 10B and 11B possess nuclear spin. The nuclear spin of 10B is 3 and that of 11B is 3/2. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The 10B and 11B nuclei also cause splitting in the resonances of attached nuclei.[68]\n\n\n\n### Occurrence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Borate minerals\n\nSee also: Category:Borate minerals\n\n![](image)A fragment of ulexite\n![](image)Borax crystals\nBoron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.\n\n\nIn the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form. Extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in Lunar regolith.[69][70]\n\n\nAlthough boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble.\nIt is found naturally combined in compounds such as borax and boric acid (sometimes found in volcanic spring waters). About a hundred borate minerals are known.\n\n\nOn 5 September 2017, scientists reported that the *Curiosity* rover detected boron, an essential ingredient for life on Earth, on the planet Mars. Such a finding, along with previous discoveries that water may have been present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of Gale Crater on Mars.[71][72]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEconomically important sources of boron are the minerals colemanite, rasorite (kernite), ulexite and tincal. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey, including the provinces of Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir.[73][74][75] Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.[76]\n\n\nTurkey and the United States are the largest producers of boron products. Turkey produces about half of the global yearly demand, through Eti Mine Works (Turkish: *Eti Maden İşletmeleri*) a Turkish state-owned mining and chemicals company focusing on boron products. It holds a government monopoly on the mining of borate minerals in Turkey, which possesses 72% of the world's known deposits.[77] In 2012, it held a 47% share of production of global borate minerals, ahead of its main competitor, Rio Tinto Group.[78]\n\n\nAlmost a quarter (23%) of global boron production comes from the single Rio Tinto Borax Mine (also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine) 35°2′34.447″N 117°40′45.412″W﻿ / ﻿35.04290194°N 117.67928111°W﻿ / 35.04290194; -117.67928111﻿ (Rio Tinto Borax Mine) near Boron, California.[79][80]\n\n\n\n### Market trend[edit]\n\n\nThe average cost of crystalline elemental boron is US$5/g.[81] Elemental boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.\n\n\nEstimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4 million tonnes of B2O3 in 2012. As compounds such as borax and kernite its cost was US$377/tonne in 2019.[82] Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.\n\n\nThe form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.\n\n\nIncreasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned Eti Mine Works opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (borax) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.[83][84]\n\n\nThe rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in glass fiber, fiberglass and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the US. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.[83][85]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boron deficiency (plant disorder) and Boron deficiency (medicine)\n\nNearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into boric acid and sodium tetraborate pentahydrate. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.[86][87]\nThe major global industrial-scale use of boron compounds (about 46% of end-use) is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers.[88] Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.[89]\n\n\n\n### Elemental boron fiber[edit]\n\n\nBoron fibers (boron filaments) are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods.[90][91] The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament.[92][93]\n\n\nBoron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows production of even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450 GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17 GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.[94]\n\n\n\n### Boronated fiberglass[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fiberglass\n\nFiberglass is a fiber reinforced polymer made of plastic reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.\n\n\nThe highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are E-glass (named for \"Electrical\" use, but now the most common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation, and D-glass, a borosilicate glass, named for its low dielectric constant.[95]\n\n\nNot all fiberglasses contain boron, but on a global scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because of the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.\n\n\n\n### Borosilicate glass[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Borosilicate glass\n\n![](image)Borosilicate glassware. Displayed are two beakers and a test tube.\nBorosilicate glass, which is typically 12–15% B2O3, 80% SiO2, and 2% Al2O3, has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. Schott AG's \"Duran\" and Owens-Corning's trademarked Pyrex are two major brand names for this glass, used both in laboratory glassware and in consumer cookware and bakeware, chiefly for this resistance.[96]\n\n\n\n### Boron carbide ceramic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boron carbide\n\n![](image)Unit cell of B4C. The green sphere and icosahedra consist of boron atoms, and black spheres are carbon atoms.[97]\nSeveral boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.\nBoron carbide is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B2O3 with carbon in an electric furnace:\n\n\n\n2 B2O3 + 7 C → B4C + 6 CO\nBoron carbide's structure is only approximately B4C, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.\n\n\nBoron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants.[98] Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.[99]\n\n\n\n### High-hardness and abrasive compounds[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Superhard materials\n\n\n\nMechanical properties of BCN solids[100] and ReB2[101]\n| Material\n | Diamond\n | cubic-BC2N\n | cubic-BC5 | cubic-BN\n | B4C\n | ReB2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vickers hardness (GPa)\n | 115\n | 76\n | 71\n | 62\n | 38\n | 22\n |\n| Fracture toughness (MPa m1⁄2)\n | 5.3\n | 4.5\n | 9.5\n | 6.8\n | 3.5\n |  |\n\n\nBoron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. Boron nitride is a material isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon,[102] is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.\n\n\n\n### Metallurgy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Boron steel and Boriding\n\nBoron is added to boron steels at the level of a few parts per million to increase hardenability. Higher percentages are added to steels used in the nuclear industry due to boron's neutron absorption ability.\n\n\nBoron can also increase the surface hardness of steels and alloys through boriding. Additionally metal borides are used for coating tools through chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.[103]\n\n\nFor example, rhenium diboride can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.[101]\nSimilarly, AlMgB14 + TiB2 composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.[104]\n\n\n\n### Detergent formulations and bleaching agents[edit]\n\n\nBorax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products,[105] including the \"20 Mule Team Borax\" laundry booster and \"Boraxo\" powdered hand soap. It is also present in some tooth bleaching formulas.[87]\n\n\nSodium perborate serves as a source of active oxygen in many detergents, laundry detergents, cleaning products, and laundry bleaches. However, despite its name, \"Borateem\" laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using sodium percarbonate instead as a bleaching agent.[106]\n\n\n\n### Insecticides[edit]\n\n\nBoric acid is used as an insecticide, notably against ants, fleas, and cockroaches.[107]\n\n\n\n### Semiconductors[edit]\n\n\nBoron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source.[108] Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however, not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides.[109] Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source.[110] Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride–boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.[111]\n\n\n\n### Magnets[edit]\n\n\nBoron is a component of neodymium magnets (Nd2Fe14B), which are among the strongest type of permanent magnet. These magnets are found in a variety of electromechanical and electronic devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medical imaging systems, in compact and relatively small motors and actuators. As examples, computer HDDs (hard disk drives), CD (compact disk) and DVD (digital versatile disk) players rely on neodymium magnet motors to deliver intense rotary power in a remarkably compact package. In mobile phones 'Neo' magnets provide the magnetic field which allows tiny speakers to deliver appreciable audio power.[112]\n\n\n\n### Shielding and neutron absorber in nuclear reactors[edit]\n\n\nBoron shielding is used as a control for nuclear reactors, taking advantage of its high cross-section for neutron capture.[113]\n\n\nIn pressurized water reactors a variable concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water is used as a neutron poison to compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel. When new rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is maximal, and is reduced during the lifetime.[114]\n\n\n\n### Other nonmedical uses[edit]\n\n\nLaunch of *Apollo 15* Saturn V rocket, using triethylborane ignitor\n* Because of its distinctive green flame, amorphous boron is used in pyrotechnic flares.[115]\n* In the 1950s, there were several studies of the use of boranes as energy-increasing \"Zip fuel\" additives for jet fuel.\n* Starch and casein-based adhesives contain sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na2B4O7·10 H2O)\n* Some anti-corrosion systems contain borax.[116]\n* Sodium borates are used as a flux for soldering silver and gold and with ammonium chloride for welding ferrous metals.[117] They are also fire retarding additives to plastics and rubber articles.[118]\n* Boric acid (also known as orthoboric acid) H3BO3 is used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays[87][119] and in many PVAc- and PVOH-based adhesives.\n* Triethylborane is a substance which ignites the JP-7 fuel of the Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet/ramjet engines powering the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.[120] It was also used to ignite the F-1 Engines on the Saturn V Rocket utilized by NASA's Apollo and Skylab programs from 1967 until 1973. Today SpaceX uses it to ignite the engines on their Falcon 9 rocket.[121] Triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially the fact that it burns with a very high temperature.[122] Triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures.\n* Borates are used as environmentally benign wood preservatives.[123]\n\n\n### Pharmaceutical and biological applications[edit]\n\n\nBoron plays a role in pharmaceutical and biological applications as it is found in various bacteria-produced antibiotics, such as boromycins, aplasmomycins, borophycins, and tartrolons. These antibiotics have shown inhibitory effects on certain bacteria, fungi, and protozoa growth. Boron is also being studied for its potential medicinal applications, including its incorporation into biologically active molecules for therapies like boron neutron capture therapy for brain tumors. Some boron-containing biomolecules may act as signaling molecules interacting with cell surfaces, suggesting a role in cellular communication.[124]\n\n\n**Boric acid** has antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties and, for these reasons, is applied as a water clarifier in swimming pool water treatment.[125] Mild solutions of boric acid have been used as eye antiseptics.\n\n\n**Bortezomib** (marketed as **Velcade** and **Cytomib**). Boron appears as an active element in the organic pharmaceutical bortezomib, a new class of drug called the proteasome inhibitor, for treating myeloma and one form of lymphoma (it is currently in experimental trials against other types of lymphoma). The boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome[126] with high affinity and specificity.\n\n\n\n* A number of potential boronated pharmaceuticals using boron-10, have been prepared for use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).[127]\n* Some boron compounds show promise in treating arthritis, though none have as yet been generally approved for the purpose.[128]\n\n\n**Tavaborole** (marketed as **Kerydin**) is an Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase inhibitor which is used to treat toenail fungus. It gained FDA approval in July 2014.[129]\n\n\nDioxaborolane chemistry enables radioactive fluoride (18F) labeling of antibodies or red blood cells, which allows for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cancer[130] and hemorrhages,[131] respectively. A Human-Derived, Genetic, Positron-emitting and Fluorescent (HD-GPF) reporter system uses a human protein, PSMA and non-immunogenic, and a small molecule that is positron-emitting (boron bound 18F) and fluorescence for dual modality PET and fluorescent imaging of genome modified cells, e.g. cancer, CRISPR/Cas9, or CAR T-cells, in an entire mouse.[132] The dual-modality small molecule targeting PSMA was tested in humans and found the location of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, fluorescence-guided removal of cancer, and detects single cancer cells in tissue margins.[133]\n\n\nIn neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for malignant brain tumors, boron is researched to be used for selectively targeting and destroying tumor cells. The goal is to deliver higher concentrations of the non-radioactive boron isotope (10B) to the tumor cells than to the surrounding normal tissues. When these 10B-containing cells are irradiated with low-energy thermal neutrons, they undergo nuclear capture reactions, releasing high linear energy transfer (LET) particles such as α-particles and lithium-7 nuclei within a limited path length. These high-LET particles can destroy the adjacent tumor cells without causing significant harm to nearby normal cells. Boron acts as a selective agent due to its ability to absorb thermal neutrons and produce short-range physical effects primarily affecting the targeted tissue region. This binary approach allows for precise tumor cell killing while sparing healthy tissues. The effective delivery of boron involves administering boron compounds or carriers capable of accumulating selectively in tumor cells compared to surrounding tissue. BSH and BPA have been used clinically, but research continues to identify more optimal carriers. Accelerator-based neutron sources have also been developed recently as an alternative to reactor-based sources, leading to improved efficiency and enhanced clinical outcomes in BNCT. By employing the properties of boron isotopes and targeted irradiation techniques, BNCT offers a potential approach to treating malignant brain tumors by selectively killing cancer cells while minimizing the damage caused by traditional radiation therapies.[134]\n\n\nBNCT has shown promising results in clinical trials for various other malignancies, including glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, cutaneous melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and extramammary Paget's disease. The treatment involves a nuclear reaction between nonradioactive boron-10 isotope and low-energy thermal or high-energy epithermal neutrons to generate α particles and lithium nuclei that selectively destroy DNA in tumor cells. The primary challenge lies in developing efficient boron agents with higher content and specific targeting properties tailored for BNCT. Integration of tumor-targeting strategies with BNCT could potentially establish it as a practical personalized treatment option for different types of cancers. Ongoing research explores new boron compounds, optimization strategies, theranostic agents, and radiobiological advances to overcome limitations and cost-effectively improve patient outcomes.[135][136][137]\n\n\n\n### Research areas[edit]\n\n\nMagnesium diboride is an important superconducting material with the transition temperature of 39 K. MgB2 wires are produced with the powder-in-tube process and applied in superconducting magnets.[138][139]\n\n\nAmorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel-chromium braze alloys.[140]\n\n\nHexagonal boron nitride forms atomically thin layers, which have been used to enhance the electron mobility in graphene devices.[141][142] It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of desirable properties.[143]\n\n\nBoron has multiple applications in nuclear fusion research. It is commonly used for conditioning the walls in fusion reactors by depositing boron coatings on plasma-facing components and walls to reduce the release of hydrogen and impurities from the surfaces.[144] It is also being used for the dissipation of energy in the fusion plasma boundary to suppress excessive energy bursts and heat fluxes to the walls.[145][146]\n\n\n\n## Biological role[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boron deficiency (plant disorder)\n\nBoron is an essential plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0 ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8 ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8 ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0 ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.[147][148][149]\n\n\nIt is thought that boron plays several essential roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood.[150][151] A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.[152]\n\n\nBoron is not classified as an essential human nutrient because research has not established a clear biological function for boron.[153][154] Still, studies suggest that boron may exert beneficial effects on reproduction and development, calcium metabolism, bone formation, brain function, insulin and energy substrate metabolism, immunity, and steroid hormone (including estrogen) and vitamin D function, among other functions.[155][154] The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) found the existing data insufficient to derive a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), Adequate Intake (AI), or Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for boron.[153][154] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not established a Daily Value for boron for food and dietary supplement labeling purposes.[153] While low boron status can be detrimental to health, probably increasing the risk of osteoporosis, poor immune function, and cognitive decline; high boron levels are associated with cell damage and toxicity.[156] The exact mechanism by which boron exerts its physiological effects is not fully understood, but may involve interactions with adenosine monophosphate (ADP) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e), two compounds involved in important cellular functions. Furthermore, boron appears to inhibit cyclic ADP-ribose, thereby affecting the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum and affecting various biological processes.[156] Some studies suggest that boron may reduce levels of inflammatory biomarkers.[155]\n\n\nIn humans, boron is usually consumed with food that contains boron, such as fruits, leafy vegetables, and nuts.[153] Foods that are particularly rich in boron include avocados, dried fruits such as raisins, peanuts, pecans, prune juice, grape juice, wine and chocolate powder.[155][153] According to 2-day food records from the respondents to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), adult dietary intake was recorded at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day.[157]\n\n\nIn 2013, a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.[158]\n\n\nThere exist several known boron-containing natural antibiotics.[159] The first one found was boromycin, isolated from streptomyces in the 1960s.[160][161] Others are tartrolons, a group of antibiotics discovered in the 1990s from culture broth of the myxobacterium *Sorangium cellulosum*.[162]\n\n\nCongenital endothelial dystrophy type 2, a rare form of corneal dystrophy, is linked to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.[163]\n\n\n\n### Analytical quantification[edit]\n\n\nFor determination of boron content in food or materials, the colorimetric *curcumin method* is used. Boron is converted to boric acid or borates and on reaction with curcumin in acidic solution, a red colored boron-chelate complex, rosocyanine, is formed.[164]\n\n\n\n### Health issues and toxicity[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nBoron\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:[165] |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS07: Exclamation mark](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Warning** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H302, H412 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P264, P270, P273, P301+P312, P501 |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | [166]\n![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n1\n0\n0\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\nElemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2 g/kg are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4 g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5 grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.[167] Dietary supplementation of boron may be helpful for bone growth, wound healing, and antioxidant activity,[168] and insufficient amount of boron in diet may result in boron deficiency.\n\n\nSingle medical doses of 20 g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity.\n\n\nBoric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.[107]\n\n\nThe boranes (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, boron is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but the toxicity of these compounds depends on structure (for another example of this phenomenon, see phosphine).[14][15] The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling, some combinations of boranes and other compounds are highly explosive. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.[169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Boron toxicity in rose leaves.\nBoron is necessary for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil.[170][171] It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, but it can be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.[172]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Allotropes of boron\n* Boron deficiency\n* Boron oxide\n* Boron nitride\n* Boron neutron capture therapy\n* Boronic acid\n* Hydroboration-oxidation reaction\n* Suzuki coupling\n\nPortal:* ![](image) Chemistry\n**Boron** at Wikipedia's sister projects:\n* ![](image)**Definitions** from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)**Media** from Commons\n* ![](image)**Resources** from Wikiversity\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Van Setten et al. 2007, pp. 2460–1\n2. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Boron\".

atomic number 1. It is the lightest element, and at standard conditions it is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless,[11] non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter.[12][note 1] Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\n\n\nIn the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang. The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons.[13]\n\n\nHydrogen is nonmetallic (except when it becomes metallic at extremely high pressures) and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol **p**) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically,[14] the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n\nHydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance[15] and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\".\n\n\nIndustrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. A small percentage is also produced using more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water.[16][17] Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production. Hydrogen can be deployed as an energy source in fuel cells to produce electricity, or via combustion to generate heat.[18] When hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells, the only emission at the point of use is water vapour.[18] Combustion of hydrogen can lead to the thermal formation of nitrogen oxides.[18] Hydrogen atoms may embrittle metals.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\n\n### Combustion[edit]\n\n\nCombustion of hydrogen with the oxygen in the air. When the bottom cap is removed, allowing air to enter at the bottom, the hydrogen in the container rises out of top and burns as it mixes with the air.\n![A black cup-like object hanging by its bottom with blue glow coming out of its opening.](image)The Space Shuttle Main Engine burnt hydrogen with oxygen, producing a nearly invisible flame at full thrust.\nHydrogen gas (**dihydrogen** or molecular hydrogen)[20] is highly flammable:\n\n\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l) (572 kJ/2 mol = 286 kJ/mol = 141.865 MJ/kg)[note 2]\nThe enthalpy of combustion is −286 kJ/mol.[21]\n\n\nHydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4–74%[22] and with chlorine at 5–95%. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 °C (932 °F).[23]\n\n\n\n#### Flame[edit]\n\n\nPure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.[24] The destruction of the *Hindenburg* airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated. The visible flames in the photographs were the result of carbon compounds in the airship skin burning.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Reactants[edit]\n\n\nH2 is unreactive compared to diatomic elements such as halogens or oxygen. The thermodynamic basis of this low reactivity is the very strong H–H bond, with a bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol.[26] The kinetic basis of the low reactivity is the nonpolar nature of H2 and its weak polarizability. It spontaneously reacts with chlorine and fluorine to form hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, respectively.[27] The reactivity of H2 is strongly affected by the presence of metal catalysts. Thus, while mixtures of H2 with O2 or air combust readily when heated to at least 500 °C by a spark or flame, they do not react at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst.\n\n\n\n### Electron energy levels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrogen atom\n\n![Drawing of a light-gray large sphere with a cut off quarter and a black small sphere and numbers 1.7x10−5 illustrating their relative diameters.](image)Depiction of a hydrogen atom with size of central proton shown, and the atomic diameter shown as about twice the Bohr model radius (image not to scale)\nThe ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6 eV,[28] which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 91 nm wavelength.[29]\n\n\nThe energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as \"orbiting\" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force, while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.[30]\n\n\nA more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the Schrödinger equation, Dirac equation or Feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton.[31] The most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all—illustrating how the \"planetary orbit\" differs from electron motion.\n\n\n\n### Spin isomers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spin isomers of hydrogen\n\nMolecular H2 exists as two spin isomers, i.e. compounds that differ only in the spin states of their nuclei.[32] In the **orthohydrogen** form, the spins of the two nuclei are parallel, forming a spin triplet state having a total molecular spin \n\n\n\nS\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=1}\n\n![{\\displaystyle S=1}](image); in the **parahydrogen** form the spins are antiparallel and form a spin singlet state having spin \n\n\n\nS\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=0}\n\n![{\\displaystyle S=0}](image). The equilibrium ratio of ortho- to para-hydrogen depends on temperature. At room temperature or warmer, equilibrium hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form.[33] The ortho form is an excited state, having higher energy than the para form by 1.455 kJ/mol,[34] and it converts to the para form over the course of several minutes when cooled to low temperature.[35] The thermal properties of the forms differ because they differ in their allowed rotational quantum states, resulting in different thermal properties such as the heat capacity.[36]\n\n\nThe ortho-to-para ratio in H2 is an important consideration in the liquefaction and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate most of the liquid if not converted first to parahydrogen during the cooling process.[37] Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide and activated carbon compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling to avoid this loss of liquid.[38]\n\n\n\n### Phases[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hydrogen gas is colorless and transparent, here contained in a glass ampoule.\n![Phase diagram of hydrogen on logarithmic scales. Lines show boundaries between phases, with the end of the liquid-gas line indicating the critical point. The triple point of hydrogen is just off-scale to the left.](image)Phase diagram of hydrogen. The temperature and pressure scales are logarithmic, so one unit corresponds to a 10× change. The left edge corresponds to 105 Pa, which is about atmospheric pressure.[*image reference needed*]\n* Gaseous hydrogen\n* Liquid hydrogen\n* Slush hydrogen\n* Solid hydrogen\n* Metallic hydrogen\n* Plasma hydrogen\n\n\n### Compounds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Category:Hydrogen compounds\n\n#### Covalent and organic compounds[edit]\n\n\nWhile H2 is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge.[39] When bonded to a more electronegative element, particularly fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with another electronegative element with a lone pair, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules.[40][41] Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.[42]\n\n\nHydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons, and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that, because of their general association with living things, are called organic compounds.[43] The study of their properties is known as organic chemistry[44] and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry.[45] By some definitions, \"organic\" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond that gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word \"organic\" in chemistry.[43] Millions of hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated pathways that seldom involve elemental hydrogen.\n\n\nHydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals[46] and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals.[47] Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice.[48] These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals,[19] complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Hydrides[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydride\n\n![](image)A sample of sodium hydride\nCompounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term \"hydride\" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H−, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode.[50] For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is BeH2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the [AlH4]− anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).\n\n\nAlthough hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known, but only one binary aluminium hydride.[51] Binary indium hydride has not yet been identified, although larger complexes exist.[52]\n\n\nIn inorganic chemistry, hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex. This function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron hydrides) and aluminium complexes, as well as in clustered carboranes.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Protons and acids[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Acid–base reaction\n\nOxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives H+, which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton. That is why H+ is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of acids. Under the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.\n\n\nA bare proton, H+, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted \"H+\" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.\n\n\nTo avoid the implication of the naked \"solvated proton\" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the \"hydronium ion\" ([H3O]+). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to [H9O4]+.[54] Other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents.[55]\n\n\nAlthough exotic on Earth, one of the most common ions in the universe is the H+3 ion, known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation.[56]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of hydrogen\n\n![](image)\n![](image)Hydrogen discharge (spectrum) tube\n![](image)Deuterium discharge (spectrum) tube\nHydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, denoted 1  \nH, 2  \nH and 3  \nH. Other, highly unstable nuclei (4  \nH to 7  \nH) have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature.[57][58]\n\n\n\n* **1  \nH** is the most common hydrogen isotope, with an abundance of more than 99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton, it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name *protium*.[59] It is unique among all stable isotopes in having no neutrons; see diproton for a discussion of why others do not exist.\n* **2  \nH**, the other stable hydrogen isotope, is known as *deuterium* and contains one proton and one neutron in the nucleus. Nearly all deuterium in the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the Big Bang, and has endured since that time. Deuterium is not radioactive, and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard. Water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water. Deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for 1  \nH-NMR spectroscopy.[60] Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors. Deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion.[61]\n* **3  \nH** is known as *tritium* and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years.[53] It is so radioactive that it can be used in luminous paint to enhance the visibility of data displays, such as for painting the hands and dial-markers of watches. The watch glass prevents the small amount of radiation involved from escaping the case.[62] Small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests.[63] It is used in nuclear fusion reactions,[64] as a tracer in isotope geochemistry,[65] and in specialized self-powered lighting devices.[66] Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel.[67]\n\n\nUnique among the elements, distinct names are assigned to its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of 2  \nH and 3  \nH) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the symbol P is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium.[68] In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) allows any of D, T, 2  \nH, and 3  \nH to be used, although 2  \nH and 3  \nH are preferred.[69]\n\n\nThe exotic atom muonium (symbol Mu), composed of an antimuon and an electron, can also be considered a light radioisotope of hydrogen.[70] Because muons decay with lifetime 2.2 µs, muonium is too unstable to exhibit observable chemistry.[71] Nevertheless, muonium compounds are important test cases for quantum simulation, due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the proton,[72] and IUPAC nomenclature incorporates such hypothetical compounds as muonium chloride (MuCl) and sodium muonide (NaMu), analogous to hydrogen chloride and sodium hydride respectively.[73]\n\n\n\n### Thermal and physical properties[edit]\n\n\nTable of thermal and physical properties of hydrogen (H2) at atmospheric pressure:[74][75]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Temperature (K)\n | Density (kg/m^3)\n | Specific heat (kJ/kg °C)\n | Dynamic viscosity (kg/m s)\n | Kinematic viscosity (m^2/s)\n | Thermal conductivity (W/m °C)\n | Thermal diffusivity (m^2/s)\n | Prandtl Number\n |\n| 100\n | 0.24255\n | 11.23\n | 4.21E-06\n | 1.74E-05\n | 6.70E-02\n | 2.46E-05\n | 0.707\n |\n| 150\n | 0.16371\n | 12.602\n | 5.60E-06\n | 3.42E-05\n | 0.0981\n | 4.75E-05\n | 0.718\n |\n| 200\n | 0.1227\n | 13.54\n | 6.81E-06\n | 5.55E-05\n | 0.1282\n | 7.72E-05\n | 0.719\n |\n| 250\n | 0.09819\n | 14.059\n | 7.92E-06\n | 8.06E-05\n | 0.1561\n | 1.13E-04\n | 0.713\n |\n| 300\n | 0.08185\n | 14.314\n | 8.96E-06\n | 1.10E-04\n | 0.182\n | 1.55E-04\n | 0.706\n |\n| 350\n | 0.07016\n | 14.436\n | 9.95E-06\n | 1.42E-04\n | 0.206\n | 2.03E-04\n | 0.697\n |\n| 400\n | 0.06135\n | 14.491\n | 1.09E-05\n | 1.77E-04\n | 0.228\n | 2.57E-04\n | 0.69\n |\n| 450\n | 0.05462\n | 14.499\n | 1.18E-05\n | 2.16E-04\n | 0.251\n | 3.16E-04\n | 0.682\n |\n| 500\n | 0.04918\n | 14.507\n | 1.26E-05\n | 2.57E-04\n | 0.272\n | 3.82E-04\n | 0.675\n |\n| 550\n | 0.04469\n | 14.532\n | 1.35E-05\n | 3.02E-04\n | 0.292\n | 4.52E-04\n | 0.668\n |\n| 600\n | 0.04085\n | 14.537\n | 1.43E-05\n | 3.50E-04\n | 0.315\n | 5.31E-04\n | 0.664\n |\n| 700\n | 0.03492\n | 14.574\n | 1.59E-05\n | 4.55E-04\n | 0.351\n | 6.90E-04\n | 0.659\n |\n| 800\n | 0.0306\n | 14.675\n | 1.74E-05\n | 5.69E-04\n | 0.384\n | 8.56E-04\n | 0.664\n |\n| 900\n | 0.02723\n | 14.821\n | 1.88E-05\n | 6.90E-04\n | 0.412\n | 1.02E-03\n | 0.676\n |\n| 1000\n | 0.02424\n | 14.99\n | 2.01E-05\n | 8.30E-04\n | 0.448\n | 1.23E-03\n | 0.673\n |\n| 1100\n | 0.02204\n | 15.17\n | 2.13E-05\n | 9.66E-04\n | 0.488\n | 1.46E-03\n | 0.662\n |\n| 1200\n | 0.0202\n | 15.37\n | 2.26E-05\n | 1.12E-03\n | 0.528\n | 1.70E-03\n | 0.659\n |\n| 1300\n | 0.01865\n | 15.59\n | 2.39E-05\n | 1.28E-03\n | 0.568\n | 1.96E-03\n | 0.655\n |\n| 1400\n | 0.01732\n | 15.81\n | 2.51E-05\n | 1.45E-03\n | 0.61\n | 2.23E-03\n | 0.65\n |\n| 1500\n | 0.01616\n | 16.02\n | 2.63E-05\n | 1.63E-03\n | 0.655\n | 2.53E-03\n | 0.643\n |\n| 1600\n | 0.0152\n | 16.28\n | 2.74E-05\n | 1.80E-03\n | 0.697\n | 2.82E-03\n | 0.639\n |\n| 1700\n | 0.0143\n | 16.58\n | 2.85E-05\n | 1.99E-03\n | 0.742\n | 3.13E-03\n | 0.637\n |\n| 1800\n | 0.0135\n | 16.96\n | 2.96E-05\n | 2.19E-03\n | 0.786\n | 3.44E-03\n | 0.639\n |\n| 1900\n | 0.0128\n | 17.49\n | 3.07E-05\n | 2.40E-03\n | 0.835\n | 3.73E-03\n | 0.643\n |\n| 2000\n | 0.0121\n | 18.25\n | 3.18E-05\n | 2.63E-03\n | 0.878\n | 3.98E-03\n | 0.661\n |\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery and use[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of hydrogen technologies\n\nIn 1671, the Irish scientist Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas.[76][77]\n\n\n\n\n> Having provided a saline spirit [hydrochloric acid], which by an uncommon way of preparation was made exceeding sharp and piercing, we put into a vial, capable of containing three or four ounces of water, a convenient quantity of filings of steel, which were not such as are commonly sold in shops to Chymists and Apothecaries, (those being usually not free enough from rust) but such as I had a while before caus'd to be purposely fil'd off from a piece of good steel. This metalline powder being moistn'd in the viol with a little of the menstruum, was afterwards drench'd with more; whereupon the mixture grew very hot, and belch'd up copious and stinking fumes; which whether they consisted altogether of the volatile sulfur of the Mars [iron?], or of metalline steams participating of a sulfureous nature, and join'd with the saline exhalations of the menstruum, is not necessary to be here discuss'd. But whencesoever this stinking smoak proceeded, so inflammable it was, that upon the approach of a lighted candle to it, it would readily enough take fire, and burn with a blewish and somewhat greenish flame at the mouth of the viol for a good while together; and that, though with little light, yet with more strength than one would easily suspect.\n> \n> — Robert Boyle, Tracts written by the Honourable Robert Boyle containing new experiments, touching the relation betwixt flame and air...\n> \n\n\nThe word \"sulfureous\" may be somewhat confusing, especially since Boyle did a similar experiment with iron and sulfuric acid.[78] However, in all likelihood, \"sulfureous\" should here be understood to mean *combustible*.[79]\n\n\nIn 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction \"inflammable air\". He speculated that \"inflammable air\" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called \"phlogiston\"[80][81] and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element.[7][8] In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- *hydro* meaning \"water\" and -γενής *genes* meaning \"former\")[82] when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier\nLavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:\n\n\n\n1) Fe + H2O → FeO + H2\n2) Fe + 3 H2O → Fe2O3 + 3 H2\n3) Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2\nMany metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.\n\n\nHydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask.[8] He produced solid hydrogen the next year.[8] Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck.[7] Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932.[8] François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.[8]\n\n\nThe first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by Jacques Charles in 1783.[8] Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard.[8] German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900.[8] Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.\n\n\nThe first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship *R34* in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H2 was used in the *Hindenburg* airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over New Jersey on 6 May 1937.[8] The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a lifting gas was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel ceased. Hydrogen is still used, in preference to non-flammable but more expensive helium, as a lifting gas for weather balloons.\n\n\nIn the same year, the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.;[83] because of the thermal conductivity and very low viscosity of hydrogen gas, thus lower drag than air, this is the most common type in its field today for large generators (typically 60 MW and bigger; smaller generators are usually air-cooled).\n\n\nThe nickel–hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2).[84] For example, the ISS,[85] Mars Odyssey[86] and the Mars Global Surveyor[87] are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009,[88] more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life.[89]\n\n\n\n### Role in quantum theory[edit]\n\n\n![A line spectrum showing black background with narrow lines superimposed on it: one violet, one blue, one cyan, and one red.](image)Hydrogen emission spectrum lines in the visible range. These are the four visible lines of the Balmer series.\nBecause of its simple atomic structure, consisting only of a proton and an electron, the hydrogen atom, together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it, has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure.[90] Furthermore, study of the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation H+2 brought understanding of the nature of the chemical bond, which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s.\n\n\nOne of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.[91]\n\n\nAntihydrogen (  \nH  \n) is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen. It consists of an antiproton with a positron. Antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter atom to have been produced as of 2015[update].[92][93]\n\n\n\n## Cosmic prevalence and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![A white-green cotton-like clog on black background.](image)NGC 604, a giant region of ionized hydrogen in the Triangulum Galaxy\nHydrogen, as atomic H, is the most abundant chemical element in the universe, making up 75 percent of normal matter by mass and more than 90 percent by number of atoms. (Most of the mass of the universe, however, is not in the form of chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy.[94]) This element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets. Molecular clouds of H2 are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction in case of stars with very low to approximately 1 mass of the Sun and the CNO cycle of nuclear fusion in case of stars more massive than the Sun.[95]\n\n\n\n### States[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states, with properties quite distinct from those of molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.\n\n\nHydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium because the atoms seldom collide and combine. They are the source of the 21-cm hydrogen line at 1420 MHz that is detected in order to probe primordial hydrogen.[96] The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to a redshift of *z* = 4.[97]\n\n\nUnder ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. Hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (around 0.53 ppm on a molar basis[98]) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from the atmosphere more rapidly than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface,[99] mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water.[53]\n\n\nA molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen (H+3) is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays. This ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet Jupiter. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density. H+3 is one of the most abundant ions in the universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium.[100] Neutral triatomic hydrogen H3 can exist only in an excited form and is unstable.[101] By contrast, the positive hydrogen molecular ion (H+2) is a rare molecule in the universe.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrogen production\n\nMany methods exist for producing H2, but three dominate commercially: steam reforming often coupled to water-gas shift, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, and water electrolysis.[102]\n\n\n\n### Steam reforming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Illustrating inputs and outputs of steam reforming of natural gas, a process to produce hydrogen[*image reference needed*]\nHydrogen is mainly produced by steam reforming, the reaction of water and methane.[103][104] [105] Thus, at high temperatures (1000–1400 K, 700–1100 °C or 1300–2000 °F), steam (water vapor) reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and H2.\n\n\n\nCH4 + H2O → CO + 3 H2\nSteam reforming is also used for the industrial preparation of ammonia.\n\n\nThis reaction is favored at low pressures, Nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0 MPa, 20 atm or 600 inHg) because high-pressure H2 is the most marketable product, and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as \"synthesis gas\" because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and many other compounds. Hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:\n\n\n\nCH4 → C + 2 H2\nConsequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of H2O. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction. This process requires an iron oxide catalyst:[105]\n\n\n\nCO + H2O → CO2 + H2\nHydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process for the production of ammonia, hydrogen is generated from natural gas.[106]\n\n\n\n### Partial oxidation of hydrocarbons[edit]\n\n\nOther methods for CO and H2 production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:[107]\n\n\n\n2 CH4 + O2 → 2 CO + 4 H2\nAlthough less important commercially, coal can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:[105]\n\n\n\nC + H2O → CO + H2\nOlefin production units may produce substantial quantities of byproduct hydrogen particularly from cracking light feedstocks like ethane or propane.[108]\n\n\n\n### Water electrolysis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Illustrating inputs and outputs of simple electrolysis of water production of hydrogen\nThe electrolysis of water is a conceptually simple method of producing hydrogen. \n\n\n\n2 H2O(l) → 2 H2(g) + O2(g)\nCommercial electrolyzers use nickel-based catalysts in strongly alkaline solution. Platinum is a superior catalyst but is expensive.[109]\n\n\nElectrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.[110]\n\n\n\n### Methane pyrolysis[edit]\n\n\nHydrogen can be produced by pyrolysis of natural gas (methane).\n\n\nThis route has a lower carbon footprint than commercial hydrogen production processes.[111][112][113][114] Developing a commercial methane pyrolysis process could expedite the expanded use of hydrogen in industrial and transportation applications. Methane pyrolysis is accomplished by passing methane through a molten metal catalyst containing dissolved nickel. Methane is converted to hydrogen gas and solid carbon.[115][116]\n\n\n\nCH4(g) → C(s) + 2 H2(g) (ΔH° = 74 kJ/mol)\nThe carbon may be sold as a manufacturing feedstock or fuel, or landfilled.\n\n\nFurther research continues in several laboratories, including at Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory [117] and at University of California – Santa Barbara.[118] BASF built a methane pyrolysis pilot plant.[119]\n\n\n\n### Thermochemical[edit]\n\n\nMore than 200 thermochemical cycles can be used for water splitting. Many of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle, cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle, sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle have been evaluated for their commercial potential to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.[120] A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the United States) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.[121]\n\n\n\n### Laboratory methods[edit]\n\n\nH2 is produced in laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions. Many metals react with water to produce H2, but the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the metal, the pH, and the presence of alloying agents. Most commonly, hydrogen evolution is induced by acids. The alkali and alkaline earth metals, aluminium, zinc, manganese, and iron react readily with aqueous acids. This reaction is the basis of the Kipp's apparatus, which once was used as a laboratory gas source:\n\n\n\nZn + 2 H+ → Zn2+ + H2\nIn the absence of acid, the evolution of H2 is slower. Because iron is widely used structural material, its anaerobic corrosion is of technological significance:\n\n\n\nFe + 2 H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2\nMany metals, such as aluminium, are slow to react with water because they form passivated coatings of oxides. An alloy of aluminium and gallium, however, does react with water.[122] At high pH, aluminium can produce H2:\n\n\n\n2 Al + 6 H2O + 2 OH− → 2 [Al(OH)4]− + 3 H2\nSome metal-containing compounds react with acids to evolve H2. Under anaerobic conditions, ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)  \n2) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and H2. This process is described by the Schikorr reaction:\n\n\n\n3 Fe(OH)2 → Fe3O4 + 2 H2O + H2\nThis process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.\n\n\n\n### Biohydrogen[edit]\n\n\nH2 is produced by hydrogenase enzymes in some fermentation.[123]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n### Petrochemical industry[edit]\n\n\nLarge quantities of H2 are used in the \"upgrading\" of fossil fuels. Key consumers of H2 include hydrodealkylation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. Many of these reactions can be classified as hydrogenolysis, i.e., the cleavage of bonds by hydrogen. Illustrative is the separation of sulfur from liquid fossil fuels:[102]\n\n\n\nR2S + 2 H2 → H2S + 2 RH\n### Hydrogenation[edit]\n\n\nHydrogenation, the addition of H2 to various substrates is conducted on a large scale. The hydrogenation of N2 to produce ammonia by the Haber–Bosch process consumes a few percent of the energy budget in the entire industry. The resulting ammonia is used to supply the majority of the protein consumed by humans.[124] Hydrogenation is used to convert unsaturated fats and oils to saturated fats and oils. The major application is the production of margarine. Methanol is produced by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. H2 is also used as a reducing agent for the conversion of some ores to the metals.[125]\n\n\n\n### Coolant[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrogen-cooled turbo generator\n\nHydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include low density, low viscosity, and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases.\n\n\n\n### Energy carrier[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hydrogen economy\n\nElemental hydrogen is widely discussed in the context of energy, as an energy carrier with potential to help the decarbonisation of economies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.[126][127] This therefore requires hydrogen to be produced cleanly, in quantities to supply in sectors and applications where cheaper and more energy efficient mitigation alternatives are limited. These include heavy industry and long-distance transport.[126] Hydrogen is a ''carrier'' of energy rather than an energy resource, because there is no naturally occurring source of hydrogen in useful quantities.[128]\n\n\nHydrogen can be deployed as an energy source in fuel cells to produce electricity, or via combustion to generate heat.[18] When hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells, the only emission at the point of use is water vapour.[18] Combustion of hydrogen can lead to the thermal formation of harmful nitrogen oxides.[18] The overall lifecycle emissions of hydrogen depend on how it is produced. Nearly all of the world's current supply of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels.[129][130] The main method is steam methane reforming, in which hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane, the main component of natural gas. Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits 6.6–9.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide.[131] While carbon capture and storage (CCS) could remove a large fraction of these emissions, the overall carbon footprint of hydrogen from natural gas is difficult to assess as of 2021[update], in part because of emissions (including vented and fugitive methane) created in the production of the natural gas itself.[132]\n\n\nElectricity can be used to split water molecules, producing sustainable hydrogen provided the electricity was generated sustainably. However, this electrolysis process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from methane without CCS and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low.[127] Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of variable renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity.[133] Hydrogen created through electrolysis using renewable energy is commonly referred to as \"green hydrogen.\"[134] It can be further transformed into synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol.[135]\n\n\nInnovation in hydrogen electrolysers could make large-scale production of hydrogen from electricity more cost-competitive.[136] There is potential for hydrogen produced this way to play a significant role in decarbonising energy systems where there are challenges and limitations to replacing fossil fuels with direct use of electricity.[126]\n\n\nHydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, thus contributing to the decarbonisation of industry alongside other technologies, such as electric arc furnaces for steelmaking.[137] However, it is likely to play a larger role in providing industrial feedstock for cleaner production of ammonia and organic chemicals.[126] For example, in steelmaking, hydrogen could function as a clean energy carrier and also as a low-carbon catalyst replacing coal-derived coke.[138] Hydrogen used to decarbonise transportation is likely to find its largest applications in shipping, aviation and to a lesser extent heavy goods vehicles, through the use of hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol, and fuel cell technology.[126] For light duty vehicles including passenger cars, hydrogen is far behind other alternative fuel vehicles, especially compared with the rate of adoption of battery electric vehicles, and may not play a significant role in future.[139]\n\n\nDisadvantages of hydrogen as an energy carrier include high costs of storage and distribution due to hydrogen's explosivity, its large volume compared to other fuels, and its tendency to make pipes brittle.[132]\n\n\n\n### Semiconductor industry[edit]\n\n\nHydrogen is employed to saturate broken (\"dangling\") bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties.[140] It is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including ZnO,[141][142] SnO2, CdO, MgO,[143] ZrO2, HfO2, La2O3, Y2O3, TiO2, SrTiO3, LaAlO3, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrSiO4, HfSiO4, and SrZrO3.[144]\n\n\n\n### Niche and evolving uses[edit]\n\n\n* **Shielding gas:** Hydrogen is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding.[145][146]\n\n\n* **Cryogenic research:** Liquid H2 is used in cryogenic research, including superconductivity studies.[147]\n\n\n* **Buoyant lifting:** Because H2 is lighter than air, having only 7% of the density of air, it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships.[148]\n* **Leak detection:** Pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas), hydrogen is a tracer gas for detection of minute leaks. Applications can be found in the automotive, chemical, power generation, aerospace, and telecommunications industries.[149] Hydrogen is an authorized food additive (E 949) that allows food package leak testing, as well as having anti-oxidizing properties.[150]\n\n\n* **Neutron moderation:** Deuterium (hydrogen-2) is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons.\n* **Nuclear fusion fuel:** Deuterium is used in nuclear fusion reactions.[8]\n* **Isotopic labeling:** Deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of isotope effects on reaction rates.[151]\n\n\n* **Rocket propellant:** Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen together serve as cryogenic fuel in liquid-propellant rockets, as in the Space Shuttle main engines. NASA has investigated the use of rocket propellant made from atomic hydrogen, boron or carbon that is frozen into solid molecular hydrogen particles that are suspended in liquid helium. Upon warming, the mixture vaporizes to allow the atomic species to recombine, heating the mixture to high temperature.[152]\n* **Tritium uses:** Tritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in the production of hydrogen bombs,[153] as an isotopic label in the biosciences,[67] and as a source of beta radiation in radioluminescent paint for instrument dials and emergency signage.[62]\n\n\n## Biological reactions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Biohydrogen and Biological hydrogen production (Algae)\n\nH2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents, produced during pyruvate fermentation, to water.[154] The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.[155]\nBacteria such as *Mycobacterium smegmatis* can utilize the small amount of hydrogen in the atmosphere as a source of energy when other sources are lacking, using a hydrogenase with small channels that exclude oxygen and so permits the reaction to occur even though the hydrogen concentration is very low and the oxygen concentration is as in normal air.[98][156]\n\n\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the human body in terms of numbers of atoms of the element but the third most abundant element by mass. H2 occurs in the breath of humans due to the metabolic activity of hydrogenase-containing microorganisms in the large intestine and is a natural component of flatus. The concentration in the breath of fasting people at rest is typically less than 5 parts per million (ppm) but can be 50 ppm when people with intestinal disorders consume molecules they cannot absorb during diagnostic hydrogen breath tests.[157]\n\n\nWater splitting, in which water is decomposed into its component protons, electrons, and oxygen, occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms. Some such organisms, including the alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* and cyanobacteria, have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast.[158] Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize H2 gas even in the presence of oxygen.[159] Efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor.[160]\n\n\n\n## Safety and precautions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrogen safety\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:\n |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS02: Flammable](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Danger** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H220 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P202, P210, P271, P377, P381, P403[161] |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | ![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n0\n4\n0\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\nHydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety, from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form.[162] In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids.[163] Hydrogen dissolves in many metals and in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement,[164] leading to cracks and explosions.[165] Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.[166]\n\n\nEven interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.[162]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Combined cycle hydrogen power plant\n* Hydrogen economy – Using hydrogen to decarbonize sectors which are hard to electrify\n* Hydrogen production – Industrial production of molecular hydrogen\n* Hydrogen safety – Procedures for safe production, handling and use of hydrogen\n* Hydrogen technologies – Technologies that relating to the production & use of hydrogen\n* Hydrogen transport\n* Liquid hydrogen – Liquid state of the element hydrogen\n* Methane pyrolysis – Thermal decomposition of materialsPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets (for hydrogen)\n* Natural hydrogen – Molecular hydrogen naturally occurring on Earth\n* Pyrolysis – Thermal decomposition of materials\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** However, most of the universe's mass is not in the form of baryons or chemical elements.

has symbol **He** and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table.[a] Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at standard pressure. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. The most common isotope of helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.\n\n\nHelium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by Georges Rayet,[13] Captain C. T. Haig,[14] Norman R. Pogson,[15] and Lieutenant John Herschel,[16] and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.[17] Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.[18][19] In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today.\n\n\nLiquid helium is used in cryogenics (its largest single use, consuming about a quarter of production), and in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with its main commercial application in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding, and in processes such as growing crystal to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A small but well-known use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships.[20] As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (helium I and helium II) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.\n\n\nOn Earth, it is relatively rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing.[21][22] However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the Earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities,[23] in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific discoveries[edit]\n\n\nThe first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India.[25][26] This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer, Norman Lockyer, observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which, he named the D3 because it was near the known D1 and D2 Fraunhofer lines of sodium.[27][28] He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (*helios*).[29][30]\n\n\n\n![Picture of visible spectrum with superimposed sharp yellow and blue and violet lines](image)Spectral lines of helium\nIn 1881, Italian physicist Luigi Palmieri detected helium on Earth for the first time through its D3 spectral line, when he analyzed a material that had been sublimated during a recent eruption of Mount Vesuvius.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sir William Ramsay, the discoverer of terrestrial helium\n![](image)The cleveite sample from which Ramsay first purified helium[32]\nOn March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite with at least 10% rare-earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas, liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun.[28][33][34][35] These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes.[36][37] It was independently isolated from cleveite, in the same year, by chemists, Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet, in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight.[38][39][26][40] Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist, William Francis Hillebrand, prior to Ramsay's discovery, when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen.[41] His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery, and near-discovery, in science.[42]\n\n\nIn 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei, by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin, glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube, to study the spectrum of the new gas inside.[43] In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than 5 K (−268.15 °C; −450.67 °F).[44][45] He tried to solidify it, by further reducing the temperature, but failed, because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1 cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.[46][47]\n\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr published his \"trilogy\"[48][49] on atomic structure that included a reconsideration of the Pickering–Fowler series as central evidence in support of his model of the atom.[50][51] This series is named for Edward Charles Pickering, who in 1896 published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectrum of the star ζ Puppis[52] (these are now known to occur with Wolf–Rayet and other hot stars).[53] Pickering attributed the observation (lines at 4551, 5411, and 10123 Å) to a new form of hydrogen with half-integer transition levels.[54][55] In 1912, Alfred Fowler[56] managed to produce similar lines from a hydrogen-helium mixture, and supported Pickering's conclusion as to their origin.[57] Bohr's model does not allow for half-integer transitions (nor does quantum mechanics) and Bohr concluded that Pickering and Fowler were wrong, and instead assigned these spectral lines to ionised helium, He+.[58] Fowler was initially skeptical[59] but was ultimately convinced[60] that Bohr was correct,[48] and by 1915 \"spectroscopists had transferred [the Pickering–Fowler series] definitively [from hydrogen] to helium.\"[51][61] Bohr's theoretical work on the Pickering series had demonstrated the need for \"a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories\" and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.[51]\n\n\nIn 1938, Russian physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa discovered that helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero, a phenomenon now called superfluidity.[62] This phenomenon is related to Bose–Einstein condensation. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity.[63]\n\n\nIn 1961, Vignos and Fairbank reported the existence of a different phase of solid helium-4, designated the gamma-phase. It exists for a narrow range of pressure between 1.45 and 1.78 K.[64]\n\n\n\n### Extraction and use[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this section **may not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

Following a suggestion by Sir Richard Threlfall, the United States Navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of 5,700 m3 (200,000 cu ft) of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained.[28] Some of this gas was used in the world's first helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navy's C-class blimp C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921,[69] nearly two years before the Navy's first *rigid* helium-filled airship, the Naval Aircraft Factory-built USS *Shenandoah*, flew in September 1923.\n\n\nAlthough the extraction process using low-temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.[70]\n\n\nThe government of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime.[28] Because of the Helium Act of 1925, which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, German Zeppelins were forced to use hydrogen as lifting gas, which would gain infamy in the Hindenburg disaster. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.[71]\n\n\nAfter the Helium Acts Amendments of 1960 (Public Law 86–777), the U.S. Bureau of Mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this *helium conservation* program, the Bureau built a 425-mile (684 km) pipeline from Bushton, Kansas, to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field near Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, at which time it was further purified.[72]\n\n\nBy 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was US$1.4 billion in debt, prompting the Congress of the United States in 1996 to discontinue the reserve.[26][73] The resulting Helium Privatization Act of 1996[74] (Public Law 104–273) directed the United States Department of the Interior to empty the reserve, with sales starting by 2005.[75]\n\n\nHelium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.[76]\n\n\nFor many years, the United States produced more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17 million cubic meters (600 million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year.[77] In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium.[78] Through this time, both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased.[79] From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.[80]\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], the United States National Helium Reserve accounted for 30 percent of the world's helium.[81] The reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018.[81] Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.[81]\n\n\nIn 2013, Qatar started up the world's largest helium unit,[82] although the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there.[83] 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business, following years of renowned shortages.[84] Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.[85]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Atom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Helium atom\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Length scale about 1 Angstrom. An inset outlines the structure of the core, with two red and two blue atoms at the length scale of 1 femtometer.](image)**The helium atom.** Depicted are the nucleus (pink) and the electron cloud distribution (black). The nucleus (upper right) in helium-4 is in reality spherically symmetric and closely resembles the electron cloud, although for more complicated nuclei this is not always the case.\n#### In quantum mechanics[edit]\n\n\nIn the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps.[86] Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge *Z*eff which each electron sees is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic \"bare\" helium nucleus.\n\n\n\n#### Related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell[edit]\n\n\nThe nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.\n\n\nFor example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.\n\n\nIn a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (two protons and one neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.\n\n\n\n![](image)Binding energy per nucleon of common isotopes. The binding energy per particle of helium-4 is significantly larger than all nearby nuclides.\nThe unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the \"soup\" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. Owing to the relatively tight binding of helium-4 nuclei, its production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and thus few neutrons were available to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5.[87] It is barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.\n\n\nAll heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.\n\n\n\n### Gas and plasma phases[edit]\n\n\n![Illuminated light red gas discharge tubes shaped as letters H and e](image)Helium discharge tube shaped into 'He', the element's symbol.\nHelium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements.[88] It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.[28]\n\n\nHelium is the least water-soluble monatomic gas,[89] and one of the least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5),[90] and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas.[91] Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50 K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion.[28] Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.\n\n\nMost extraterrestrial helium is plasma in stars, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.[92]\n\n\n\n### Liquid phase[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liquid helium\n\n![](image)Phase diagram of helium-4. (Atmospheric pressure is about 0.1 MPa)\n![](image)Liquefied helium. This helium is not only liquid, but has been cooled to the point of superfluidity. The drop of liquid at the bottom of the glass represents helium spontaneously escaping from the container over the side, to empty out of the container. The energy to drive this process is supplied by the potential energy of the falling helium.\nHelium liquifies when cooled below 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. Unlike any other element, however, helium remains liquid down to a temperature of absolute zero. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing. Pressures above about 25 atmospheres are required to freeze it. There are two liquid phases: Helium I is a conventional liquid, and Helium II, which occurs at a lower temperature, is a superfluid. \n\n\n\n#### Helium I[edit]\n\n\nBelow its boiling point of 4.22 K (−268.93 °C; −452.07 °F) and above the lambda point of 2.1768 K (−270.9732 °C; −455.7518 °F), the isotope helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state, called *helium I*.[28] Like other cryogenic liquids, helium I boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered. Below the lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further. \n\n\nHelium I has a gas-like index of refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is.[28] This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K),[93] which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics.[28] Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called *quantum fluids*, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Helium II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Superfluid helium-4\n\nLiquid helium below its lambda point (called *helium II*) exhibits very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity, when it boils, it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about the properties of the isotope.[28]\n\n\n\n![A cross-sectional drawing showing one vessel inside another. There is a liquid in the outer vessel, and it tends to flow into the inner vessel over its walls.](image)Unlike ordinary liquids, helium II will creep along surfaces in order to reach an equal level; after a short while, the levels in the two containers will equalize. The Rollin film also covers the interior of the larger container; if it were not sealed, the helium II would creep out and escape.[28]\nHelium II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10 to 100 nm it has no measurable viscosity.[26] However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the *two-fluid model* for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.[94]\n\n\nIn the *fountain effect*, a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium II by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.[95]\n\n\nThe thermal conductivity of helium II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of helium I and several hundred times that of copper.[28] This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. Helium II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8 K through helium II as waves in a phenomenon known as *second sound*.[28]\n\n\nHelium II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of helium II, the helium II moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. Helium II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30 nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin.[28][96][97] As a result of this creeping behavior and helium II's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, it is very difficult to confine. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the helium II will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force.[98] These waves are known as *third sound*.[99]\n\n\n\n### Solid phases[edit]\n\n\nHelium remains liquid down to absolute zero at atmospheric pressure, but it freezes at high pressure. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K (about −272 °C or −457 °F) at about 25 bar (2.5 MPa) of pressure.[100] It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%.[101] With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa[102] it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006 g/cm3 at 1.15 K and 66 atm; the projected density at 0 K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009 g/cm3.[103] At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.[104]\n\n\nHelium-4 and helium-3 both form several crystalline solid phases, all requiring at least 25 bar. They both form an α phase, which has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structure, a β phase, which is face-centered cubic (fcc), and a γ phase, which is body-centered cubic (bcc).[105]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of helium\n\nThere are nine known isotopes of helium of which two, helium-3 and helium-4, are stable. In the Earth's atmosphere, one atom is 3  \nHe for every million that are 4  \nHe.[26] Unlike most elements, helium's isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.[106]\n\n\nHelium-3 is present on Earth only in trace amounts. Most of it has been present since Earth's formation, though some falls to Earth trapped in cosmic dust.[107] Trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium.[108] Rocks from the Earth's crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten, and these ratios can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the Earth's mantle.[107] 3  \nHe is much more abundant in stars as a product of nuclear fusion. Thus in the interstellar medium, the proportion of 3  \nHe to 4  \nHe is about 100 times higher than on Earth.[109] Extraplanetary material, such as lunar and asteroid regolith, have trace amounts of helium-3 from being bombarded by solar winds. The Moon's surface contains helium-3 at concentrations on the order of 10 ppb, much higher than the approximately 5 ppt found in the Earth's atmosphere.[110][111] A number of people, starting with Gerald Kulcinski in 1986,[112] have proposed to explore the Moon, mine lunar regolith, and use the helium-3 for fusion.\n\n\nLiquid helium-4 can be cooled to about 1 K (−272.15 °C; −457.87 °F) using evaporative cooling in a 1-K pot. Similar cooling of helium-3, which has a lower boiling point, can achieve about 0.2 kelvin in a helium-3 refrigerator. Equal mixtures of liquid 3  \nHe and 4  \nHe below 0.8 K separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity (they follow different quantum statistics: helium-4 atoms are bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions).[28] Dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.[113]\n\n\nIt is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes, which rapidly decay into other substances. The shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is the unbound helium-10 with a half-life of 2.6(4)×10−22 s.[6] Helium-6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half-life of 0.8 second. Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear reactions.[28] Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.[28]\n\n\n\n### Properties[edit]\n\n\nTable of thermal and physical properties of helium gas at atmospheric pressure:[114][115]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Temperature (K)\n | Density (kg/m^3)\n | Specific heat (kJ/kg °C)\n | Dynamic viscosity (kg/m s)\n | Kinematic viscosity (m^2/s)\n | Thermal conductivity (W/m °C)\n | Thermal diffusivity (m^2/s)\n | Prandtl number |\n| 100\n |  | 5.193\n | 9.63E-06\n | 1.98E-05\n | 0.073\n | 2.89E-05\n | 0.686\n |\n| 120\n | 0.406\n | 5.193\n | 1.07E-05\n | 2.64E-05\n | 0.0819\n | 3.88E-05\n | 0.679\n |\n| 144\n | 0.3379\n | 5.193\n | 1.26E-05\n | 3.71E-05\n | 0.0928\n | 5.28E-05\n | 0.7\n |\n| 200\n | 0.2435\n | 5.193\n | 1.57E-05\n | 6.44E-05\n | 0.1177\n | 9.29E-05\n | 0.69\n |\n| 255\n | 0.1906\n | 5.193\n | 1.82E-05\n | 9.55E-05\n | 0.1357\n | 1.37E-04\n | 0.7\n |\n| 366\n | 0.1328\n | 5.193\n | 2.31E-05\n | 1.74E-04\n | 0.1691\n | 2.45E-04\n | 0.71\n |\n| 477\n | 0.10204\n | 5.193\n | 2.75E-05\n | 2.69E-04\n | 0.197\n | 3.72E-04\n | 0.72\n |\n| 589\n | 0.08282\n | 5.193\n | 3.11E-05\n | 3.76E-04\n | 0.225\n | 5.22E-04\n | 0.72\n |\n| 700\n | 0.07032\n | 5.193\n | 3.48E-05\n | 4.94E-04\n | 0.251\n | 6.66E-04\n | 0.72\n |\n| 800\n | 0.06023\n | 5.193\n | 3.82E-05\n | 6.34E-04\n | 0.275\n | 8.77E-04\n | 0.72\n |\n| 900\n | 0.05451\n | 5.193\n | 4.14E-05\n | 7.59E-04\n | 0.33\n | 1.14E-03\n | 0.687\n |\n| 1000\n |  | 5.193\n | 4.46E-05\n | 9.14E-04\n | 0.354\n | 1.40E-03\n | 0.654\n |\n\n\n## Compounds[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Helium compounds\n\n![](image)Structure of the helium hydride ion, HHe+\n![](image)Structure of the suspected fluoroheliate anion, OHeF−\nHelium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions.[101] It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential.[28] Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions He+  \n2, He2+  \n2, HeH+  \n, and HeD+  \n have been created this way.[116] HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has a large number of band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.[28]\n\n\nVan der Waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium gas and atoms of some other substance, such as LiHe and He2.[117]\n\n\nTheoretically, other true compounds may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF), which would be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000.[118] Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable.[119] Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.[120]\n\n\nHelium atoms have been inserted into the hollow carbon cage molecules (the fullerenes) by heating under high pressure. The endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures. When chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside.[121] If helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.[122] Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds.\n\n\nUnder high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell.[123] The insulating electride Na2He has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa. It has a fluorite structure.[124]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence and production[edit]\n\n\n### Natural abundance[edit]\n\n\nAlthough it is rare on Earth, helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe, constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. Only hydrogen is more abundant.[26] The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton–proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.[106]\n\n\nIn the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million.[125][126] The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes.[127][128][129] In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.\n\n\nMost helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including uraninite and its varieties cleveite and pitchblende,[18][130] carnotite and monazite (a group name; \"monazite\" usually refers to monazite-(Ce)),[131][132] because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere.[133][134][135] In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.[136][137]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update] the world's helium reserves were estimated at 31 billion cubic meters, with a third of that being in Qatar.[138] In 2015 and 2016 additional probable reserves were announced to be under the Rocky Mountains in North America[139] and in the East African Rift.[140]\n\n\n\n### Modern extraction and distribution[edit]\n\n\nFor large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain as much as 7% helium.[141] Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium.[28] The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long-distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.[78][142]\n\n\nIn 2008, approximately 169 million standard cubic meters (SCM) of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately 78% from the United States, 10% from Algeria, and most of the remainder from Russia, Poland and Qatar.[143] By 2013, increases in helium production in Qatar (under the company Qatargas managed by Air Liquide) had increased Qatar's fraction of world helium production to 25%, and made it the second largest exporter after the United States.[144]\nAn estimated 54 billion cubic feet (1.5×109 m3) deposit of helium was found in Tanzania in 2016.[145] A large-scale helium plant was opened in Ningxia, China in 2020.[146]\n\n\nIn the United States, most helium is extracted from natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Panhandle Field in Texas.[78][147] Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National Helium Reserve, but since 2005 this reserve is being depleted and sold off, and is expected to be largely depleted by 2021,[144] under the October 2013 *Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act* (H.R. 527).[148] The helium fields of the western United States are emerging as an alternate source of helium supply, particularly those of the 'Four Corners' region (the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah).[149]\n\n\nDiffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium.[150] In 1996, the U.S. had *proven* helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM).[151] At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM per year in the U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.\n\n\nHelium is generally extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at only a fraction of that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants.[152] Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.[153]\n\n\nHelium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, it can be supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42 m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8 m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of as much as 4,860 m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).\n\n\n\n### Conservation advocates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Helium storage and conservation\n\nAccording to helium conservationists like Nobel laureate physicist Robert Coleman Richardson, writing in 2010, the free market price of helium has contributed to \"wasteful\" usage (e.g. for helium balloons). Prices in the 2000s had been lowered by the decision of the U.S. Congress to sell off the country's large helium stockpile by 2015.[154] According to Richardson, the price needed to be multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium. In the paper *Stop squandering helium* published in 2012, it was also proposed to create an International Helium Agency that would build a sustainable market for \"this precious commodity\".[155]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n![A large solid cylinder with a hole in its center and a rail attached to its side.](image)The largest single use of liquid helium is to cool the superconducting magnets in modern MRI scanners.\nEstimated 2014 U.S. fractional helium use by category. Total use is 34 million cubic meters.[156]\n\n\n\nCryogenics (32%)\nPressurizing and purging (18%)\nWelding (13%)\nControlled atmospheres (18%)\nLeak detection (4%)\nBreathing mixtures (2%)\nOther (13%)\n\nWhile balloons are perhaps the best known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use.[73] Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers.[157] Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.[156]\n\n\n\n### Controlled atmospheres[edit]\n\n\nHelium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography,[101] because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels[158] and impulse facilities.[159]\n\n\n\n### Gas tungsten arc welding[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gas tungsten arc welding\n\nHelium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen.[26] A number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.\n\n\n\n### Minor uses[edit]\n\n\n#### Industrial leak detection[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of a large, metal-framed device (about 3×1×1.5 m) standing in a room.](image)A dual chamber helium leak detection machine\nOne industrial application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers.[160] The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.[161]\n\n\nHelium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.[162]\n\n\n\n#### Flight[edit]\n\n\n![The Good Year Blimp](image)Because of its low density and incombustibility, helium is the gas of choice to fill airships such as the Goodyear blimp.\nBecause it is lighter than air, airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane at a lower rate, helium has the advantage of being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to backfill rocket propellant tanks in flight and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000 m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Minor commercial and recreational uses[edit]\n\n\nHelium as a breathing gas has no narcotic properties, so helium mixtures such as trimix, heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis, which worsen with increasing depth.[163][164] As pressure increases with depth, the density of the breathing gas also increases, and the low molecular weight of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing by lowering the density of the mixture. This reduces the Reynolds number of flow, leading to a reduction of turbulent flow and an increase in laminar flow, which requires less work of breathing.[165][166] At depths below 150 metres (490 ft) divers breathing helium–oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function, symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome.[167] This effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a helium–oxygen mixture.[168]\n\n\nHelium–neon lasers, a type of low-powered gas laser producing a red beam, had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode lasers.[26]\n\n\nFor its inertness and high thermal conductivity, neutron transparency, and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions, helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled nuclear reactors.[160]\n\n\nHelium, mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for thermoacoustic refrigeration due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number.[169] The inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.[170]\n\n\nHelium is also used in some hard disk drives.[171]\n\n\n\n#### Scientific uses[edit]\n\n\nThe use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between lenses in some telescopes, due to its extremely low index of refraction.[28] This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.[172][173]\n\n\nHelium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography.\n\n\nThe age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating.[26][28]\n\n\nHelium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN uses 96 metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9 K (−271.25 °C; −456.25 °F).[174]\n\n\n\n#### Medical uses[edit]\n\n\nHelium was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020 for humans and animals.[175][176]\n\n\n\n## As a contaminant[edit]\n\n\nWhile chemically inert, helium contamination impairs the operation of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such that iPhones may fail.[177]\n\n\n\n## Inhalation and safety[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nNeutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nEffect of helium on a human voice\n\n\nThe effect of helium on a human voice\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nThe speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air. Because the natural resonance frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled, a corresponding increase occurs in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract, which is the amplifier of vocal sound.[26][178] This increase in the resonant frequency of the amplifier (the vocal tract) gives an increased amplification to the high-frequency components of the sound wave produced by the direct vibration of the vocal folds, compared to the case when the voice box is filled with air. When a person speaks after inhaling helium gas, the muscles that control the voice box still move in the same way as when the voice box is filled with air, therefore the fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds does not change.[179] However, the high-frequency-preferred amplification causes a change in timbre of the amplified sound, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.\n\n\n\n### Hazards[edit]\n\n\nInhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration.[26][180] Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006.[181][182] In 1998, an Australian girl from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.[183][184][185]\nInhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and pressure can result in barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung tissue.[180][186]\n\n\nDeath caused by helium is rare. The first media-recorded case was that of a 15-year-old girl from Texas who died in 1998 from helium inhalation at a friend's party; the exact type of helium death is unidentified.[183][184][185]\n\n\nIn the United States only two fatalities were reported between 2000 and 2004, including a man who died in North Carolina of barotrauma in 2002.[181][186] A youth asphyxiated in Vancouver during 2003, and a 27-year-old man in Australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in 2000.[181] Since then two adults asphyxiated in South Florida in 2006,[181][182][187] and there were cases in 2009 and 2010, one a Californian youth who was found with a bag over his head, attached to a helium tank,[188] and another teenager in Northern Ireland died of asphyxiation.[189] At Eagle Point, Oregon a teenage girl died in 2012 from barotrauma at a party.[190][191][192] A girl from Michigan died from hypoxia later in the year.[193]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2015, it was revealed that, during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling into a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later.[194][195] The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not yet been sufficiently recovered. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.[196][197]\n\n\nThe safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.[101]\n\n\nAt high pressures (more than about 20 atm or two MPa), a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.[198][167]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Abiogenic petroleum origin\n* Helium-3 propulsion\n* Leidenfrost effect\n* Superfluid\n* Tracer-gas leak testing method\n* Hamilton Cady\n\nPortal:* ![](image) Chemistry\n**Helium** at Wikipedia's sister projects:\n* ![](image)**Definitions** from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)**Media** from Commons\n* ![](image)**Textbooks** from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)**Resources** from Wikiversity\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A few authors dispute the placement of helium in the noble gas column, preferring to place it above beryllium with the alkaline earth metals. They do so on the grounds of helium's 1s2 electron configuration, which is analogous to the ns2 valence configurations of the alkaline earth metals, and furthermore point to some specific trends that are more regular with helium than beryllium.[7][8][9][10][11] However, the classification of helium with the other noble gases remains near-universal, as its extraordinary inertness is extremely close to that of the other light noble gases neon and argon.[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Helium\".
