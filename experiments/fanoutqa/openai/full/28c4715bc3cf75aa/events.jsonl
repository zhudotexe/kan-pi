I liked to be at home with my family.\"[24]\n\n\nAs a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[21] His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.[22]\n\n\nSpeaking about the Puerto Rican music industry, he stated, \"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Early career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nHe started to write and create his own interpretations at the age of 14,[26] until, in 2013, he began to publish his songs through SoundCloud, including \"Get\" in 2013, \"Tentación\" in 2014, \"Just let me know\" in 2015, among others.[27] In 2016, his song \"Diles\" caught the attention of DJ Luian from SoundCloud who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[5][28][29][30][31] His single \"Soy Peor\" reached number 19 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[32] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \"Ahora Me Llama\", reached number 10 on the *Billboard* Hot Latin Songs chart.[33][34] It was listed on \"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[34]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[35] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, *Trap Kingz*.[36][37] The remix of \"Te Boté\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: Major breakthrough, *X 100pre*, and *Oasis*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *X100pre* and *Oasis*\n\n![](image)Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018\nIn May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \"I Like It\".[37][39] On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \"Mia\" with Drake,[40][41] which reached number five on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[42]\n\n\nBad Bunny released his debut album *X 100pre* on December 24, 2018, on Christmas Eve 2018 on Rimas Entertainment.[43] At Metacritic, *X 100pre* received an average score of 84 based on five reviews.[44][45] Alexis Petridis of *The Guardian* praised Bad Bunny's \"off-kilter creativity\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2020, *X 100pre* was voted 447th in *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[46]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released *Oasis*, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin.[47] It peaked at number nine on the *Billboard* Hot 100[48] and topped the *Billboard* US Latin Albums chart.[49] In July 2019, he joined protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló.[50] Bad Bunny and Residente released \"*Afilando Los Cuchillos*\" (\"Sharpening the knives\") during the demonstrations.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *YHLQMDLG*, *Las que no iban a salir*, and *El Último Tour Del Mundo*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.[52] Bad Bunny announced the album *YHLQMDLG* on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020, namely February 29.[53][54] The album's title stands for \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (Spanish for \"I Do What I Want\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, Ñengo Flow, among other artist.[54][55]\n\n\n*YHLQMDLG* debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart at the time.[56] The album was met with critical acclaim, with the album's musical diversity being praised.[57] \"Vete\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019.[58] The second single, \"Ignorantes\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020.[59][53] In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\", in which the artist performs in drag.[60] \"Yo Perreo Sola\" landed number one on the *Billboard* Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years.[61]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, he released the song \"En Casita\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine due to COVID-19 and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri.[62] On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his first compilation *Las que no iban a salir*, without previous announcements.[63] The compilation's title translates to \"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\" and it contains previously unreleased or unfinished songs.[64] The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez.[63] Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \"There was no real meaning behind it.

He has also confirmed that he is working on a new album that is planned to come out sometime during the fall, Bad Bunny hinted at the possibility of the upcoming project's sound, confirming that he is “playing around and enjoying myself, letting go. I’m being inspired a lot by the music of the ’70s, —across genres, in both Spanish and English, but I’m not sure if this is going to shape my music, generally or just one song,”[103] After weeks of unconfirmed teasers and rumors, Bad Bunny revealed the album's title *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which has 22 tracks and was released on October 13, 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Soy Peor\" (2016)\n\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough hit, the song exemplifies the artist's fast-paced vocal style and his Latin trap influences.\n\n\n---\n\n\"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020)\n\n\nThe song \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" from his album *YHLQMDLG* samples the bossa nova standard \"The Girl from Ipanema\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim[105] and features Bad Bunny alternating between rapping and singing.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBad Bunny is considered to be primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist.[5][6][8][7] As described in a *Rolling Stone* article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \"conversational tone\", employing \"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies, and a rapper's cadence.\"[25] Throughout the years, Bad Bunny has listed his influences with a wide variety of artists from multiple genres such as Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, Elvis Crespo, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Calle 13, Víctor Manuelle, and Marc Anthony, amongst many others. He considers himself to be a \"music fanatic\" which is the reason why he's inspired by so many people.[1][8][3][106][107][108][109] During an episode of *Behind the Music*, he talked about Ricky Martin's legacy for Latin music and Latin artists, and how Martin changed the music landscape for future Latin artists.[107][110][111] In the music video for Neverita, Bad Bunny paid homage to the Suavemente music video by Puerto Rican artist Elvis Crespo, leaving a message in the end translated from Spanish as \"In honor of the best video of all time\". Elvis Crespo later felt honored by his tribute and ended up doing a merengue version of the song himself in which he performed at the 2022 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[112][108][113]\n\n\nAlthough primarily considered to be a Latin trap and reggaeton artist, his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres such as pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, reggae, dancehall, latin, soul, and R&B.[5][6][8][7][3] Some publications have credited him for bringing Latin trap into the mainstream in the English-language music market.[114][115][3]\n\n\nAccording to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\"[5] According to *Paper*, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \"self-love, inclusivity, and LGBTQ acceptance\".[116]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nVanessa Rosales of CNN has opined that \"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\".[117]\n\n\nHe has appeared at award shows with manicured, polished, and long fingernails.[8][118] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* opined in 2020 that Bunny's style influenced fellow Latin artists, who \"often now share his highly colorful mashup of streetwear and tailoring.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, while eating at a restaurant with his family after performing at a Zion and Lennox concert, Bad Bunny met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri.[24][119] They soon began collaborating professionally before being public about their relationship. This was seen when Berlingeri provided the reference vocals for Jennifer Lopez who featured on Bad Bunny’s track ‘Te Guste’. The two were spotted in public for the first time in 2020 at a Dallas Mavericks versus Miami Heat game in Miami. Bad Bunny would declare in an interview with Entertainment Tonight less than a month later that he was “in love.”[120] The two posted pictures with each other on social media for the first time on March 7, 2020, with a post on Bad Bunny’s Instagram. The two would continue to collaborate professionally as well. Berlingeri would feature on tracks like 2020’s “En Casita” and 2022’s “El Apagon,” and she also would be the photographer for his May 2020 *Rolling Stone* cover, making her the first-ever Latina to shoot the cover for the magazine.[121][20] The two however would go their separate ways in late 2022.[122]\n\n\nRumors of Bad Bunny being with model and media star Kendall Jenner first began to circulate in February 2023, after TMZ spotted the pair leaving a restaurant together.[123] Photos and videos of the two together on dates spread throughout the internet for months, with their first official public outing being at a Lakers-Warriors NBA playoff game on May 12, 2023.[124] In September 2023, the two featured together in a shoot for Gucci’s Valigeria campaign, one that “explores the intimacy of traveling together.”[125]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Bad Bunny had criticized a nail salon in Asturias, Spain, for refusing to give him service since he was a man; the post angered many fans, leading them to leave homophobic comments and question Bad Bunny's sexuality. Bad Bunny responded to the hateful comments by offering to impregnate the wives of his critics. The post was deleted and Bad Bunny later ended up apologizing and deleting his own Twitter account.[126][109]\n\n\nIn support of LGBT rights, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar considered to be homophobic in January 2019.[127] During a performance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down the Expreso Las Américas, a major highway also known as the Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation from the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.[134] In May 2020, he had not taken a position regarding the Puerto Rican statehood movement and had stated that he would prefer to answer at a later time with more clarification.[24] He later concluded his answer in January 2021 stating that he would never \"want to see Puerto Rico become a State\". It was widely understood that he was not necessarily advocating for Puerto Rican independence, only that he opposed the territory ever becoming the 51st state.[135]\n\n\n\n### Legal Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a woman who had been in a relationship with Bad Bunny from 2011-2016 filed a $40 million USD lawsuit against the rapper and his manager for unauthorized usage of a recording of her voice. According to the lawsuit, a 2015 recording of the woman saying \"Bad Bunny, baby\" was used without her permission in the songs \"Pa Ti\" and \"Dos Mil 16\".[136]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Bad Bunny |\n| --- |\n| Professional wrestling career |\n| Billed height | 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) |\n| Billed weight | 165 lb (75 kg) |\n| Billed from | Vega Baja, Puerto Rico |\n| Trained by | WWE Performance CenterDrew GulakAdam PearceBrian Kendrick |\n| Debut | April 10, 2021 |\n\n\nA self-professed lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Bad Bunny began making appearances in the American promotion WWE in 2021.

He eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler and lasted until the final five, when he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar.[144] On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would be a playable wrestler in the *WWE 2K23* video game as a pre-order bonus.[145]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would serve as the host for WWE's upcoming event, Backlash, taking place in his native Puerto Rico.[146] On April 1, 2023, Bad Bunny joined the Spanish announce team to commentate during the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39. Bunny would intervene during the match, preventing Dominik from attacking Rey with a chain.[147] Two nights later on *Raw*, Bunny—who was seated front row as a fan—was attacked and chokeslammed through the announcers table by former partner Damian Priest, who was now a teammate of Dominik Mysterio in The Judgment Day.[148] On the April 24 episode, Bunny returned and attacked Priest with a kendo stick, subsequently announcing that instead of hosting Backlash, he would be wrestling Priest in a San Juan Street Fight at the event.[149] On the May 5 episode of *SmackDown*, Bunny helped the Latino World Order (LWO) save Rey Mysterio from an attack from The Judgment Day, leading to Mysterio giving Bunny an LWO t-shirt, signifying his addition to the group.[150][151] At Backlash on May 6, Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight, to the admiration of his home fans.[152]\n\n\n\n### Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* **WWE**\n\t+ WWE 24/7 Championship (1 time)[153]\n\t+ Bumpy Award (1 time)\n\t\t- Best Moment of the Half-Year (2021) – Bad Bunny competing at WrestleMania[154]\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Bad Bunny\nThroughout his career Bad Bunny has received nine nominations at the Grammy Awards, winning three times for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album with *YHLQMDLG* (2021), Best Música Urbana Album for *El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2022) and *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2023), and he earned eleven Latin Grammy Awards out of twenty-seven nominations.

Two years later, he co-founded the XO record label and released the mixtapes *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*, which gained recognition for his style of contemporary and alternative R&B and the mystique surrounding his identity.[6] In 2012, he signed with Republic Records and rereleased the mixtapes in the compilation album *Trilogy*. He explored dark wave in his debut studio album *Kiss Land* (2013), which debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200. After its release, Tesfaye began contributing to film soundtracks, with his acclaimed single \"Earned It\" from *Fifty Shades of Grey* (2015) winning the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance, while also being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[7]\n\n\nTesfaye earned critical and commercial success with his pop-leaning second album *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015), which reached number one in the US, contained the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album and was nominated for Album of the Year.[8] His trap-infused third album *Starboy* (2016) saw similar commercial success and included the US number-one single of the same name and \"Die for You\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye explored new wave and dream pop with his critically-acclaimed fourth studio album *After Hours* (2020), which featured the chart record-setting single \"Blinding Lights\" and the US number-one singles \"Heartless\" and \"Save Your Tears\".[9] Dance-pop inspired his fifth album *Dawn FM* (2022), which included the US top-ten single \"Take My Breath\". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the drama series *The Idol*, which was critically panned.\n\n\nAmong the world's best-selling music artists with over 75 million records sold,[10] Tesfaye holds several streaming and *Billboard* chart records.[11][12] He is the first Canadian artist to earn four diamond-certified singles from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[13][14] \"Blinding Lights\" became the most-streamed song in Spotify history and the best-performing song in the *Billboard* Hot 100's history, as well as the longest charting song by a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100.[15][16] Tesfaye was listed by *Time* as one of the world's most influential people in 2020, and was dubbed the \"world's most popular artist\" by *Guinness World Records* in 2023.[17][18] An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[21] He is the only child of Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[23][24] He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[21][25] He has an estranged relationship with his father, telling *Rolling Stone* in 2015 that \"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there.\"[24]\n\n\nTesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox.[24][26] When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to *Variety* in 2020, \"I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things.\"[27] His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.[28] He later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school.[29] He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[30]\n\n\nWhen he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[31] He has described this period as being like the 1995 film *Kids* \"without the AIDS\", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[21][32] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to \"smarten up, to focus.\"[33][34]\n\n\nTesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.[35] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a \"crutch\" for him when it came to writing music.[36] In August 2021, during a cover story with *GQ*, he described himself as being \"sober lite\", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: \"I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there.\"[37]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2009–2011: Early beginnings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: House of Balloons, Thursday (album), and Echoes of Silence\n\nIn August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[38][39] The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary R&B project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. Rose produced three songs – \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Party & The After Party\" – and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would be credited for them.[40] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Morning\" to YouTube under the username \"xoxxxoooxo\".[41][42] His identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper Drake.[40][43] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including *Pitchfork* and *The New York Times*.[44]\n\n\nBefore adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under the aliases the Noise and Kin Kane.[24] His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, \"left one weekend and never came home.\" However, Rose claims the name was his idea.[26][45] The last 'e' was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.[46] In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity, his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.[47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim \"Sal\" Slaiby and Amir \"Cash\" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label.[50] On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape *House of Balloons*.[51][52][53] The mixtape included production from producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although he did not receive production credits.[40] *House of Balloons* was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[54] On August 18, Tesfaye released his second mixtape *Thursday*, which received generally positive reviews.[55] His third mixtape, *Echoes of Silence*, was released on December 21. It was a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize.[56][57]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Tesfaye held his first live performance at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[58] After the performance, Drake met with Tesfaye to discuss collaborations, which led to Tesfaye earning an appearance at his OVO Festival.[59] He also participated in concerts hosted by the Black Student Association at the University of Toronto.[49] Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's second studio album *Take Care*, which was released on November 15, as a songwriter, producer and a featured artist on the album's seventh single \"Crew Love\".[60]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: *Trilogy* and *Kiss Land*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Trilogy (The Weeknd album) and Kiss Land\n\n![](image)Tesfaye performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012\nBetween January and March 2012, Tesfaye performed at several Ontario universities, including Waterloo's Laurier University, Hamilton's Mohawk College and McMaster University.[61] In April, he began his first international tour; which included performances at Coachella,[62] sold-out shows at such venues as the Bowery Ballroom in New York City, which were positively reviewed by *Rolling Stone*,[62][63] and various European festivals, including Primavera Sound in Spain and Portugal,[64] and the Wireless Festival in the United Kingdom.[65][66][67] In September, Tesfaye signed with Republic Records and XO was assumed as a subsidiary label.[68] That same month, he began his first official concert tour: The Fall Tour, during which he opened for Florence and the Machine on their Ceremonials Tour in 5 cities, which included 2 shows at the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.\n\n\nOn November 13, 2012, Tesfaye released *Trilogy*, a compilation album consisting of re-mixed and remastered versions of his 2011 mixtapes and three additional tracks.[69][70][71] The album officially credited Rose as a producer and writer on the three songs from *House of Balloons* for which he did not initially receive credit.[72] *Trilogy* debuted at number four on the US *Billboard* 200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies. It also debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, with similar sales.[73][74] The album was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double-platinum by Music Canada.[75][76] It also earned Tesfaye a nomination for the Sound of 2013 poll award by BBC.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tesfaye performing at Massey Hall in October 2013\nOn May 17, 2013, Tesfaye released the title track to his debut studio album *Kiss Land*,[78] and announced the album's release date of September 10.[79] Upon release, the album debuted at number two on the *Billboard* 200 with 96,000 copies,[80] and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[81] The album was later supported by the singles \"Belong to the World\", \"Love in the Sky\" and \"Live For\" featuring Drake. Tesfaye embarked on a fall tour from September 6 to November 26.[82] As of August 2015, the album had sold 273,000 copies in the United States.[83]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Tesfaye opened for Justin Timberlake on The 20/20 Experience World Tour.[84] He then contributed to the soundtrack for *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* (2013), on the songs \"Devil May Cry\" and \"Elastic Heart\" with Sia and Diplo, the latter serving as the second single from the soundtrack.[85]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Tesfaye remixed Beyoncé's single \"Drunk in Love\" from her eponymous studio album. Retaining the theme and concept of the song, he detailed the synopsis through a male's perspective.[86] On August 25, Tesfaye collaborated with Ariana Grande on the song \"Love Me Harder\" from Grande's second studio album *My Everything*. The song was then released on September 30 as the fourth single from the album, and peaked at number seven on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[87]\n\n\nTesfaye's first headlining tour, the King of the Fall Tour, a 4-city tour of North America was held in September and October 2014, and was supported by Schoolboy Q and Jhené Aiko.[88] The tour was followed by release of the songs \"Often\" and \"King of the Fall\", leading to speculation that the former was the lead single from his second studio album, *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015).[89] On December 23, Tesfaye released the song \"Earned It\" from the soundtrack for *Fifty Shades of Grey* (2015).

The series debuted to widespread negative reviews from critics. *The Hollywood Reporter* stated that the series confirms the allegations that \"Instead of subtly skewering the misogynistic and predatory nature of the business, *The Idol* became a forbidden love story — the stuff of a toxic man’s fantasy\", and called it \"regressive rather than transgressive\".[244] He received negative reviews for his acting, with critic Robert Daniels of *The Playlist* writing, \"Tesfaye is also a terrible actor. He lacks the comfortability, the gravitas, charisma, and charm to increase the viability of Jocelyn being attracted to him. In most scenes, Tesfaye either hides under the cover of dim lighting, obtrusive coverage, or re-recorded dialogue dubbed into several scenes.\"[245] On August 28, 2023, HBO announced it had cancelled *The Idol* after one season.[246]\n\n\nOn June 8, 2023, the Weeknd announced an upcoming series of EPs featuring music from *The Idol.* Originally intended as a soundtrack album, each EP will be released following the premiere of each episode of the show.

Kelly as his main musical inspirations\n\nTesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations.[249] He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to \"Dirty Diana\" as an example.[24] His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke.[24] He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk.[250] Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City* (2002) for \"opening my eyes\" to the music of that era.[251] \"I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born\", he said in an interview for *Billboard*. \"You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound.\"[252]\n\n\nTesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*.[253] He has also cited Lana Del Rey,[254] David Bowie,[255] the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge,[256] 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan,[257][258] and Eminem as influences and inspirations.[259][260] When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with *Variety*, saying: \"Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people...\"[261]\n\n\n\n### Production and songwriting[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye's songs are \"built around a fogged, crepuscular production\",[262] and feature slow tempos,[263] rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes.[23] His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock.[264] Marc Hogan of *Spin* says that Tesfaye's samples tend \"to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace\", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah.[265] Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of *Pitchfork* credits with developing \"a state-of-the-art R&B template\" with the artist.[263] In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.[23]\n\n\nHis emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex,[262] drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in *After Hours* and *House of Balloons*.[23] Hermione Hoby of *The Guardian* characterizes Tesfaye's songs as \"narcotised-slow jams\" and delineates their message as \"partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling.\"[262] Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as \"a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover.\"[266] Anupa Mistry of the *Toronto Standard* observes throughout his mixtapes a \"cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable.\"[23] Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is \"paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent.\"[267]\n\n\n\n### Voice and music style[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye often sings in a falsetto register,[268] exhibiting an enticing tone. J. D. Considine finds his singing's \"tremulous quality\" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's \"strong basis in the blues\" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma.[264] Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G♯ (G♯5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave.[269][270] Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave.[270] Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of *Pitchfork* notes that \"his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers.\"[271] In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[272]\n\n\nTesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative, and new wave genres.[273] His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles.[274][69] Mistry writes that he \"will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B.\"[23] Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with *Time* in 2015, stating: \"Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from *House of Balloons* in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand.\"[275] Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others.[276][277] His debut studio album *Kiss Land* is categorized as R&B and dark wave.[278] His next three albums, *Beauty Behind the Madness*, *Starboy* and *After Hours*, are considered R&B and pop; with *Starboy* utilizing heavy trap influences,[279][280] and *After Hours* drawing on new wave and dream pop influences.[281][282] Tesfaye's fifth studio album *Dawn FM* explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.[283][284]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Plagiarism allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for \"The Hills\" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film *The Machine*.[285] One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample.[286] In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for \"Starboy\" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah.[287] Tesfaye denied the allegations.[288]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song \"I Need to Love\" in order to create his song \"A Lonely Night\". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making \"A Lonely Night\" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar.[289] In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation.[290][291]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that \"Pray for Me\" includes an unauthorized sample of their song \"Sunrise\".[292] Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit.[293] In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicolás Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that \"Call Out My Name\" is \"strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical\" to their 2015 track \"Vibeking\".[294][295]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of homophobic lyrics[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Tesfaye was criticized for some of the lyrics in his and Gesaffelstein's single \"Lost in the Fire\". The second verse of the song, with the lines \"You said you might be into girls, said you're going through a phase / Keeping your heart safe / Well, baby, you can bring a friend / She can ride on top your face / While I fuck you straight\", were accused of being homophobic, fetishizing bisexuality, and perpetuating the falsehood that a person who identifies as being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be \"turned straight\".[296][297] Tesfaye subtly addressed the controversy in the song \"Snowchild\" from *After Hours*, with the lines \"Every month another accusation / Only thing I'm phobic of is failing\".[298][299]\n\n\n\n### *The Idol* allegations[edit]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2023, *Rolling Stone* released a lengthy exposé on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series *The Idol*, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content which critics labeled \"torture porn\". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly \"exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished\". The series then overwent a major creative overhaul. It was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a \"female perspective\". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding \"What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century...\" however, \"It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.\" Sources alleged that Seimetz’s approach to the story was scrapped and the show became \"like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better\".[300]\n\n\nIn response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, \"*Rolling Stone*? Aren't they a little irrelevant?\". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: \"@*Rolling Stone* did we upset you?\".[301][302] Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism.[303] In an interview with *Vanity Fair*, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul.[304]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye is a cinephile, and has made numerous movie references in his music videos and teasers.[305][306] On August 30, 2019, during the Telluride Film Festival, he made his acting debut in the film *Uncut Gems*.[307]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2020, during his third appearance as a musical guest on *Saturday Night Live*, he starred in the skit \"On The Couch\" with actors Kenan Thompson and Chris Redd.[308] On May 4, he co-wrote and starred in an episode of *American Dad!.*[309] In July, he voiced three characters during the 200th episode of *Robot Chicken*.[310]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Tesfaye announced that he would be co-creating, co-writing, executive producing and starring in the HBO television drama series *The Idol*, alongside his producing partner Reza Fahim and *Euphoria* creator Sam Levinson.[311] On March 20, 2022, Tesfaye voiced two characters during an episode of *The Simpsons*.[312]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that Tesfaye is co-writing a film with Trey Edward Shults, who is attached to direct; Tesfaye is also set to star in the film, alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan.[313][314]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Tesfaye collaborated with condom company ONE to give away limited-edition condoms at his shows during the Kiss Land Fall Tour.[315][316] In November 2015, he partnered with electronic vaporizer company Pax Labs to release a limited edition vaporizer.[317][318] He also collaborated with fashion designer Alexander Wang for an apparel collection.[319] In 2016, Tesfaye became a creative collaborator and global brand ambassador for the clothing brand Puma.[320] With the partnership, he released numerous capsule collections and hosted several pop-up retail stores.[321][322]\n\n\nIn 2017, Tesfaye partnered with retail company H&M for their men's collection.[323] He cut ties with the company in 2018, following a racist incident within the company.[324] In July 2018, Tesfaye collaborated with Marvel Comics to release a comic book inspired by his third studio album *Starboy*.[325] In August, he released an apparel collection in collaboration with A Bathing Ape.[326][327] A second collection was released in January 2020.[328]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye became an owner and global ambassador of the esports company OverActive Media, who owns the Splyce and Overwatch League team Toronto Defiant.[329]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2020, Tesfaye partnered with TD Bank to launch Black HXOUSE, an entrepreneurial initiative within the incubator HXOUSE, where he serves as a sleeping partner.[330] On September 9, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a CA$221,000,000 joint venture with HXOUSE for Black Canadian entrepreneurs.[331]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Tesfaye auctioned a collection of visual artwork and an unreleased song in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) on Nifty Gateway.[332][333] In October, he joined football player Tom Brady's NFT platform Autograph as a member of their board of directors.[334]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nAfter being presented with a Bikila Award for Professional Excellence in 2014, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the University of Toronto to fund a new course on Ge'ez, the classic language of Ethiopia.[335] In May 2016, during Orthodox Easter, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Toronto, Canada, a church he attended growing up.[336][337] In August 2016, he funded a new Ethiopian studies program at the University of Toronto.[338]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Tesfaye donated US$100,000 to the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children's medical facility in Budondo, Uganda. He was inspired to support the center after learning of French Montana's work with Global Citizen and Mama Hope to help raise awareness for Suubi and the people of Uganda.[339]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Tesfaye launched a line of non-medical face masks with all of the proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, a campaign launched by the Recording Academy to help musicians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[340] In addition, Tesfaye donated US$500,000 to MusiCares and CA$500,000 to the Scarborough Health Network.[341]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Tesfaye donated US$250,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation following numerous reports of police brutality in the United States.[342][338][343] In May 2020, in response to the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed, Tesfaye donated US$500,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp, and the National Bail Out.[344] He then urged other music executives, major record labels, and streaming services to donate to the cause as well.[345][346]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2020, Tesfaye held the \"Weeknd Experience\", an interactive virtual concert on the social media platform TikTok that drew two million total viewers, including 275,000 concurrent viewers. The concert raised over US$350,000 for the Equal Justice Initiative. He also donated US$300,000 to Global Aid for Lebanon in support of victims of the Beirut explosion.[347][348] On November 2, the University of Toronto announced that it was able to reach and surpass its fundraising goal of CA$500,000 for its Ethiopic program, which included a CA$30,000 donation from Tesfaye.[349] In May 2021, he was among the celebrities expressing more solidarity for civilians who died during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis.[350][351] On September 23, Tesfaye was honored with the Quincy Jones Humanitarian Award at the inaugural Music in Action Awards, presented by the Black Music Action Coalition.[352]\n\n\n\n### WFP ambassadorship[edit]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2021, Tesfaye announced a US$1,000,000 donation through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to relief efforts in Ethiopia for people affected by the Tigray War.[353] On June 9, he met with the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, to discuss the humanitarian crisis of the Tigray War.[354] Tesfaye was appointed as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for the World Food Programme on October 7.[355][356] On March 3, 2022, he partnered with the WFP to launch the XO Humanitarian Fund. Through the fund, Tesfaye was to donate US$1 from every ticket sold at his After Hours til Dawn Tour, in addition to a US$500,000 donation, to the WFP.[357]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye is known to be very private, and prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.[358][359] In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities.[360] To this day, he is still adamant about not participating in interviews, only agreeing to be interviewed in rare situations.[361]\n\n\nFrom April 2015 to August 2019, Tesfaye was in an on-again, off-again relationship with American model Bella Hadid.[362][363] She starred in the music video for his single \"In the Night\" in December 2015.[364] He dated American singer-actress Selena Gomez from January to October 2017.[365][366] Both of the relationships received widespread media attention, and were the topic of tabloid speculation.[367][368][369] Since February 2022, Tesfaye has been in a relationship with Palestinian model Simi Khadra.[370]\n\n\nTesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.[24][371] He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with \"a hard shampoo every once in a while\".[24] He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of *Starboy*.[372] On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with \"xo\",[373] which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses.[373] According to *The Guardian*'s Hermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone.[374][375] He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of *Starboy*.[376]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Tesfaye was arrested for allegedly punching a police officer in Las Vegas after being taken into an elevator to break up a fight.[377][378] He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to complete fifty hours of community service.[379]\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Tesfaye was residing in Bel Air, Los Angeles.[380][381] In 2017, he purchased a home in Hidden Hills, California for $18.5 million, which he sold to Madonna in 2021 for $19.3 million.[382] Tesfaye previously lived in penthouses in Westwood, Los Angeles[383][384] and New York City.[385][386]\n\n\nIn April 2023, Tesfaye revealed in an interview with Interview Magazine that he has attention deficit disorder.[387]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by the Weeknd\n\nTesfaye has won four Grammy Awards, a Latin Grammy Award, twenty *Billboard* Music Awards, six American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and twenty-two Juno Awards.[388] He has also received nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.[389]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Tesfaye was awarded the Allan Slaight Honour by Canada's Walk of Fame for \"making a positive impact in the fields of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy\".[390]\n\n\nThe Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, announced that the city would observe February 7, 2021 as \"The Weeknd Day\" to commemorate Tesfaye's Super Bowl halftime performance.[391][392]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: The Weeknd discography and List of songs recorded by the Weeknd\n\n**Studio albums**\n\n\n\n* *Kiss Land* (2013)\n* *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015)\n* *Starboy* (2016)\n* *After Hours* (2020)\n* *Dawn FM* (2022)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Weeknd videography\n\n* *Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall* (2016)\n* *Uncut Gems* (2019)\n* *The Show* (2021)\n* *Live at SoFi Stadium* (2023)\n* *The Idol* (2023)\n* *Untitled Trey Edward Shults film* (TBA)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-streamed artists on Spotify\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n**Headlining**\n\n\n\n* The Fall Tour (2012)\n* The Kiss Land Fall Tour (2013)\n* King of the Fall Tour (2014)\n* The Madness Fall Tour (2015)\n* Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour (2017)\n* The Weeknd Asia Tour (2018)\n* After Hours til Dawn Tour (2022–)\n\n\n**Supporting**\n\n\n\n* Florence and the Machine – Ceremonials Tour (2012)\n* Justin Timberlake – The 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013)\n* Drake – Would You Like a Tour?

She is widely regarded as one of the most prominent singers of the 21st century. After signing with Def Jam in 2005, Rihanna soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio albums, *Music of the Sun* (2005) and *A Girl Like Me* (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten on the US *Billboard* 200 chart. Her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop and established her status as a major icon in the music industry. The chart-topping single \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award and catapulted her to global stardom.\n\n\nRihanna continued to mix pop, dance, and R&B genres on her next studio albums, *Rated R* (2009), *Loud* (2010), *Talk That Talk* (2011), and *Unapologetic* (2012), the last of which became her first *Billboard* 200 number one. The albums spawned a string of chart-topping singles, including \"Rude Boy\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What's My Name?\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", and \"Diamonds\". Her eighth album, *Anti* (2016), showcased a new creative control following her departure from Def Jam. It became her second US number one album and featured the chart-topping single \"Work\". During her musical career, Rihanna has collaborated with many artists, such as Drake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Ne-Yo, and Shakira.\n\n\nWith sales of over 250 million records worldwide, Rihanna is the second-best-selling female music artist of all time and the highest-certified female artist of all time on the RIAA's Top Artists (Digital Singles) ranking.

She is the founder of the nonprofit organization Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH; she is the first black woman to head a luxury brand for LVMH.[6] Rihanna has also ventured into acting, appearing in major roles in *Battleship* (2012), *Home* (2015), *Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets* (2017), and *Ocean's 8* (2018). She was appointed as an ambassador of education, tourism, and investment by the Government of Barbados in 2018 and was declared a National Hero of Barbados on the first day of the country's parliamentary republic in 2021, entitling her to the style of \"The Right Excellent\" for life.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRobyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[8] She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[9][10] Her mother is an Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent.[11][12][13][14] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[15][16] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17]\n\n\nAs a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\"[15] By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[10][18] She grew up listening to reggae music.[15][19] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[20][15] At age 11, Rihanna was a cadet in Barbados' Cadet Corps; the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[21][22] She initially wanted to graduate from high school, though chose to pursue a musical career instead.[23]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados.[15] Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"[15] Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".[24] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels.[24] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album *Music of the Sun*.[25] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[24]\n\n\nRihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[26] When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her.[27] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid.[24][28] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\".[24] Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \"Pon de Replay\".[27] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[29] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.[27]\nRihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing at the KIIS-FM Jingle Ball, December 2005\nAfter signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album.[29] She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken.[31] With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release.[32] In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[33] The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the *Billboard* Dance Club Songs.[34]\n\n\n*Music of the Sun* was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the *Billboard* 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units.[35] The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.[36] Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film *Bring It On: All or Nothing*, released in August 2006.[37]\n\n\nA month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album.[38] *A Girl like Me* was released in April 2006.[39] *Rolling Stone* felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album's tracks made \"*A Girl like Me* [...] likable.\"[40] The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week.[35][41] The album became Rihanna's first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units.[42] Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position.[43] \"Unfaithful\", the album's second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland.[44] Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".[45][46]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2008: Breakthrough with *Good Girl Gone Bad*[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle. The song appeared on J-Status' debut album *The Beginning*, released in several European countries only. Around that time, Rihanna had already begun work on her third studio album, *Good Girl Gone Bad*.[47] With the help of producers Timbaland, Tricky Stewart and Sean Garrett she embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks.[48][49] Released in May 2007, the album charted at No. 2 in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the UK.[50] The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three albums.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing during Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in Brisbane, 2008\nThe lead single, \"Umbrella\", topped the charts in 13 countries and remained at No. 1 in the UK for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest-running No. 1 single there since Wet Wet Wet's single \"Love Is All Around\" spent 15 weeks at the top in 1994.[52][53] It was Rihanna's first single to be named one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 8 million copies.[54][55] The songs \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Hate That I Love You\" (featuring Ne-Yo), and \"Don't Stop the Music\" were also released as singles, with the latter becoming an international hit. In support of the album, Rihanna began the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada, and Europe.[56] Rihanna was nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards for *Good Girl Gone Bad*, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\" alongside Jay-Z, her first Grammy Award.[57]\n\n\nOn June 9, 2008, Rihanna released *Good Girl Gone Bad Live*, her first live long-form video.

By late 2008, Rihanna still remained on the charts with the release of the fifth single from *Good Girl Gone Bad*, \"Rehab\", and was named \"Diva of the Year\" by *Entertainment Weekly* for her \"newfound staying power\".[58] *Good Girl Gone Bad* has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-Platinum certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna's bestselling album in the country to date.[35][59] The album has sold 9 million units worldwide.[60][61]\n\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Rihanna experimented further with pop, dubstep, and rock music, officially shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl.[62] Throughout 2008, Rihanna performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and N.E.R.D.[63] Her third studio album's reissue, *Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded*, was released in June 2008 with three new songs: \"Disturbia\", \"Take a Bow\" and the Maroon 5 duet \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", plus a Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" featuring Spanish pop singer David Bisbal.[64] All four were released as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide.[65][66][67] In August 2008, Rihanna and a host of other female singers recorded the charity single \"Just Stand Up!\", the theme song to the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer.[68] \"Live Your Life\", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, was released that November and topped the *Billboard* Hot 100.\n\n\n\n### 2009–2011: *Rated R* and *Loud*[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled.[69]\nReports surfaced that then-boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats.[70] On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats.[71] A leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com revealed that Rihanna had sustained visible injuries.[72]\nA few months after the incident, Rihanna was featured on the single \"Run This Town\" by Jay-Z, which also featured Kanye West and was released as the second single from Jay-Z's eleventh studio album *The Blueprint 3*.[73]\n\n\nIn early 2009, Rihanna began working on her fourth studio album, *Rated R*.[74] *Rated R* was released in November 2009.

James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" and wrote that her voice is powerful and that \"it is Rihanna's vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself\".[173] Andy Gill from *The Independent* feels that \"California King Bed\" features her best vocal performance.[174] In a review of *Unapologetic*, *Billboard* magazine wrote, \"Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad.\"[175] Jon Caramanica of the *New York Times* stated, \"over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It's decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders\".[176] In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked Rihanna at number 68 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[177]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"[My music is] just imagination, being creative; that's what my music is composed with. Being creative and thinking of situations, whether situations I went through or situations I've observed people going through. I can't tell you where I'll see myself in five years, but I can tell you I will work my best to be the most successful artist that I can be in five years. [I want to be] Remembered as Rihanna. Remembered as being an artist from the Caribbean who came here and made it internationally. Just remembered as me, 'cause I'm true to my music, and I just want people to realize that and appreciate me for that\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Rihanna during her first interview with MTV News[178]\n\nGrowing up in Barbados, she mainly listened to reggae, hip hop and soca music.[179] When she first came to the US, she was exposed to different types of music with \"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\"[179] During her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\".[28][180] Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, *Music of the Sun*, and its follow-up, *A Girl like Me*.[181] Her debut album demonstrates the influence of Rihanna's musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the *New York Times* complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\".[182] Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend.[36] Aiming for artistic growth, *A Girl like Me* expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature.[183] After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.\n\n\nRihanna's musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I'd never been to\".[184] With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM.[185] During a review for *Good Girl Gone Bad*, *Slant Magazine* to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she's a dance artist and the majority of the album is comprised of uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\".[186] It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career.[187][188] While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.[15][189]\n\n\nRecorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, *Rated R* had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009.[190] In her fifth album *Loud*, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album.[90] The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs.[191] *Talk That Talk* was similar to *Rated R*, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres.[192] *Loud* and *Talk That Talk* saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n' Learn\").[193] She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated\".[194] Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.[195]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna has cited Madonna (*pictured*) as her idol and biggest influence.\nRihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career.[196] She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\"[196]\nAnother major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[197] She revealed that Carey's song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\"[198][199]\n\n\nIn her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean.[200] She stated, \"He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\".[201] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours.[202][203]\nDuring her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\".[30] She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\"[204][205]\n\n\nRihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Tupac, Beyoncé and Destiny's Child.[206][207][208][209] Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion,[210] Grace Jones,[211] Lil' Kim,[212] Alicia Keys,[213] Prince,[214] Fefe Dobson,[215][216] and Brandy.[15] Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with.[179] She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\".[15] She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, *Afrodisiac* (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007).[15] In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall.[217] The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.[217]\n\n\n\n### Videos and stage[edit]\n\n\nRihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006).[218] \"We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said.[218] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\".[194] Jon Bream of the *Star Tribune* commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut, and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\"[219] George Epaminondas of *InStyle* considers Rihanna's music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"[220]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing on Last Girl on Earth Tour in Australia\nMany of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\".[194] Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image.[221] The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to *Michael Jackson's Thriller*.[219][222] The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.[223]\nIn 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence.[224] \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council.[225] \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship,[223] sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message.[226] Charne Graham of the *Houston Press* defended her, asking, \"Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\"[224] Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo.[227] As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site.\n\n\nDenis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\"[228] Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a *Billboard* poll.[229] Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned.[230] Whilst commenting on her third album's accompanying tour, *The Times* compared Rihanna's stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\"[231] In the October 2011 issue of British *Vogue*, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat's not me. That's a part I play. You know, like it's a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna modeling haute couture fashion at the 2017 Met Gala in Manhattan, representing the theme Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons Art of the In-Between\nKnown for her style and image, the media have constantly followed the evolution of Rihanna's music and fashion sense.[233] In 2009, *New York* magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\".[234] Around the time of the release of her second studio album, *A Girl like Me* (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé.[235][236] In an interview with *Look* magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles\".[237] She revealed during *Oprah's Next Chapter* that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label.[238] According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\"[239] With the release of her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller *Æon Flux* (2005).[240] She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.[241]\n\n\nNico Amarca of *Highsnobiety* magazine wrote, \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\".[242] Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album.[243][244] She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mother.[245] When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off.\"[246] Jess Cartner-Morley of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\".[247] Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, \"I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\"[248]\n\n\nIn an interview with Alexa Chung during *Vogue* Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince.[249] Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, Rihanna said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it.\"[232] In a May 2013 interview with MTV, *The Vagina Monologues* writer and feminist Eve Ensler said, \"I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented.\"[250][251]\n\n\nDescribed as one of the sexiest women of her generation,[252][253] she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it's definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\"[254] Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as *Maxim*, *FHM*, *Rolling Stone*,[255] and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of *GQ* magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue.[255]\n\n\nRihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007.[256] She has made eight appearances in the years since; notably in 2015, for China: Through the Looking Glass, her Guo Pei-designed yellow dress garnered the most attention of the event, accruing a billion impressions on social media.[257] The dress, which had taken two years to make before Rihanna came across it,[258] became the subject of a documentary by Pietra Brettkelly, entitled *Yellow Is Forbidden*.[259]\nShe co-chaired the 2018 *Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination* themed event, wearing Maison Margiela.[260]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nRihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007).[261][262][263][264][265] Nick Levine of *Digital Spy* described *Good Girl Gone Bad* as \"the closest thing to a *Thriller* that 2007/08 is likely to produce\".[266] According to *Rolling Stone*, her single \"Umbrella\" and her eighth album *Anti* are regarded as among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, respectively.[267][268] Her single \"We Found Love\" was ranked by *Billboard* as the 24th biggest US *Billboard* Hot 100 hit of all time[109] and her single \"Work\" has been credited by a *Billboard* editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music.[269] Music critic Jayson Greene of *Pitchfork* described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\n\n\n> \"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum [...] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna's. Now that she's gleefully shredding it apart, she'll probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\"[270]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Rihanna at Madame Tussauds, London\n*Time* magazine included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World issue in 2012 and 2018,[271] with Stella McCartney writing: \"She's one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride. She works hard, very hard. She gives to her fans, friends and foundation not just herself but her energy and spirit.\"[272] Rihanna was ranked one of the best dressed women in 2018, by luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter.[273] On June 2, 2014, Rihanna was presented with the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a special prize reserved for \"an individual whose style has made a significant impact on popular culture on an international stage\".[274] In August 2018, *Billboard* ranked Rihanna as the tenth biggest Hot 100 artist of all time, as well as the fifth biggest female act of all time.[275][276]\n*Billboard* also ranked Rihanna the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade.[277] In 2014, *Time* magazine's pop stardom ranking metric ranked Rihanna second in history, based on all-time chart performance and contemporary significance.[278]\n\n\nRihanna has become a dominating figure on social media and internet streaming, ranking at No. 1 on *Forbes*' 2012 list of Social Networking Superstars.[279] In 2013, Rihanna was also named the most influential pop star in the United Kingdom by UK channel 4Music.[280] Rihanna's work has directly influenced numerous artists such as Lorde,[281] Sam Smith,[282] Little Mix, Rita Ora,[283] Billie Eilish,[284] Selena Gomez,[285] Justin Bieber,[286] Ellie Goulding,[287] Kim Petras,[288] Jennie from Blackpink,[289] Marilyn Manson,[290] Jessie J,[291] SZA,[292] Fifth Harmony,[293] Camila Cabello,[294] Demi Lovato,[295] Alexandra Stan,[296] Grimes,[297] Sleater-Kinney,[298] Tegan and Sara,[299][300] Cover Drive,[301] Cher Lloyd,[302] Bad Gyal,[303] and Era Istrefi.[304]\n\n\nRihanna has an honorary title of Ambassador for Culture and Youth in Barbados.[305] On February 22, 2008, former Barbados Prime Minister David Thompson launched the national \"Rihanna Day\" in their country.

She was the first woman to create an original brand for LVMH and also the first woman of color to lead an LVMH brand. The house launched in a pop-up store on May 22, 2019, in Paris, before launching worldwide online on May 29 and included clothing, accessories, and footwear. It was the first line that LVMH had launched since 1987. The fashion brand was described as groundbreaking, and in a statement regarding the launch, Rihanna said that she had been given a \"unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.\"[334] Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, Rihanna and LVMH decided to \"put on hold\" her Fenty fashion house and continue building on the SavagexFenty lingerie line.[335]\n\n\nRihanna exclusively uses her surname for business endeavors not related to her music career so as not to conflate the two.[336] In January 2019, Rihanna filed a lawsuit against her father, Ronald Fenty, over the use of the Fenty name for commercial purposes. The lawsuit alleges Rihanna's cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, was damaged commercially by her father's company, Fenty Entertainment, through misrepresentation of his company being affiliated with her.[337] In September 2021 Rihanna dropped the lawsuit against her father.[338]\n\n\n\n#### Fenty Beauty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fenty Beauty\n\n![](image)Rihanna in a promotional video for Fenty Beauty in 2018\nIn 2017, Rihanna launched her critically acclaimed cosmetics company Fenty Beauty under LVMH's Kendo Brands.

Forty shades became the new standard.\"[344]\n\n\n\n#### Savage X Fenty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Savage X Fenty\n\nIn 2018, Rihanna launched a lingerie brand named Savage X Fenty. The line was born from Rihanna's vision creating an inclusive brand. Products come in a variety of shades to match all skin tones and a range of sizes.[345] She showcased the brand at the New York Fashion Week in September 2018. The brand has been positively reviewed by the public for including plus size models in their promotion, though some fans argued there were not enough plus sizes.[346]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Rihanna promoted the brand in a show again during the New York Fashion Week held at the Barclays Center with modeling appearances from models Alex Wek, Bella Hadid, Cara Delevingne, actress Laverne Cox, and musicians Normani and 21 Savage.

The concerts were made free for the public. Money from sponsors and advertisers were to be donated to provide medical supplies, school supplies and toys to children in need.[393][394][395] In September 2008, Rihanna contributed to the song \"Just Stand Up!\" with fifteen other female artists, who shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008, during the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" television special.

Working together, I know we can amplify our efforts and ensure that millions of children gain access to education globally.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n – Rihanna, discussing the Clara Lionel Foundation's partnership with the Global Partnership for Education[397]\n\nRihanna founded the Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF) in 2012, in honor of her grandparents, Clara and Lionel Braithwaite.

The video was released in partnership with the We Are Here Movement and called for action against police brutality.[411]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Rihanna participated in the 2017 Women's March, which took place in New York among protests the day after US President Donald Trump's inauguration.[412] She has also criticized President Trump's immigration policies–including Executive Order 13769, which sought to ban citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the United States–and his response to the 2019 shootings in El Paso and Dayton.[413][414] In October 2019, she stated that she declined to perform at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in support of Colin Kaepernick following the controversy surrounding his role in the national anthem protests.[415] In February 2021, Rihanna extended her support to Indian farmers' protest against the farm bills through Twitter.[416]\n\n\nRihanna with many others called to a transformation of the global financial system so it will be better adjusted to stop climate change and poverty. One of the ideas is to give help to countries heavily suffering from climate change.[409]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![Rihanna wearing a black top and hoop earrings](image)Rihanna in 2012\nRihanna owns a $14 million penthouse in Lower Manhattan.[417] She also purchased a house in West London for £7 million in June 2018, to be closer to her work with her FENTY fashion label.[336] In December 2018, Rihanna put her Hollywood Hills mansion up for sale after a break-in six months before. The mansion was reported to have sold for $10.4m.[418] *Forbes* began reporting on Rihanna's earnings in 2012.[419]\n\n\nRihanna began dating American singer Chris Brown in 2007. After their relationship ended in February 2009, she entered an on-again, off-again relationship with Canadian rapper Drake, which lasted from 2009 to 2016.[420] During an interview with *Rolling Stone* in January 2013, Rihanna confirmed that she had rekindled her relationship with Brown,[421] although he remained under probation for their 2009 domestic violence case.[422] Their reunion followed persistent media speculation that occurred throughout 2012.[423][424] In May 2013, Brown stated during an interview that he and Rihanna had broken up again.[425] In 2017, Rihanna began dating Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel.[426][427] They split in January 2020.[428]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2021, American rapper ASAP Rocky confirmed during an interview with *GQ* that he and Rihanna were in a relationship.[429][430][431][432] On January 31, 2022, it was revealed that the couple was expecting their first child.[433] On May 19, 2022, it was confirmed that Rihanna had given birth to a son.[434][435][436] On May 10, 2023, Rocky and Rihanna revealed their son's name as RZA Athelaston Mayers, named after Wu-Tang Clan leader and founder RZA.[437] On February 12, 2023, during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show performance, Rihanna revealed she is pregnant with her second child, becoming the first person to headline a Super Bowl halftime show while pregnant.[438][439][440] The pregnancy was confirmed in a *British Vogue* cover story featuring her family, which was released days after the Super Bowl appearance.[441] On August 1, 2023, they welcomed their second son, named Riot Rose Mayers.[442]\n\n\n\n### Domestic violence case[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled.[69] Reports surfaced that her boyfriend at the time, Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He turned himself in to the police and was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats.[70][443] On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats.[71] Due to a leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com—which revealed that Rihanna had sustained extensive visible injuries—an organization known as STOParazzi proposed \"Rihanna's Law\", which, if enacted, would \"deter employees of law enforcement agencies from releasing photos or information that exploits crime victims.\"[72] Gil Kaufman of VH1 reported the \"nonstop coverage of the Rihanna/Brown case has brought up a number of issues regarding the privacy of alleged victims of domestic violence, including the decision by almost all major news outlets to divulge the identity of the victim—which is not typically done in domestic-violence cases\" and discussed the controversial distribution of the leaked photograph.[444] Rihanna was subpoenaed to testify during a preliminary hearing in Los Angeles on June 22, 2009.[445] On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault. Brown received five years of probation and was ordered to stay 50 yards (46 m) away from Rihanna unless at public events, which then would be reduced to 10 yards (9 m).[446]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded *Larry King Live* interview, his first public interview about the matter.[447][448][449][450] He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"[447]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Rihanna\n\nAs of September 2018[update], Rihanna has sold over 250 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[451] Throughout her career, she has received numerous awards and honors, including 9 Grammy Awards, 12 *Billboard* Music Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 8 People's Choice Awards, among others.

An influential figure in contemporary popular music, Drake has been credited for popularizing singing and R&B sensibilities in hip hop. Gaining recognition by starring as Jimmy Brooks in the CTV teen drama series *Degrassi: The Next Generation* (2001–08), he pursued a recording career in 2006, releasing his debut mixtape *Room for Improvement* in February of that year. He followed up with the mixtapes *Comeback Season* (2007) and *So Far Gone* (2009) before signing with Young Money Entertainment.[4]\n\n\nDrake's first three albums, *Thank Me Later* (2010), *Take Care* (2011) and *Nothing Was the Same* (2013), were all critical successes and propelled him to the forefront of hip hop.[5] His fourth album, *Views* (2016), saw exploration of dancehall and stood atop the *Billboard* 200 for 13 non-consecutive weeks—making it the first album by a male artist to do so in over a decade—and featured the international hit singles \"Hotline Bling\" and \"One Dance\", which has been credited with popularizing Afrobeats worldwide.[6][7] In 2018, Drake released the double album *Scorpion*, which contained the US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one singles \"God's Plan\", \"Nice for What\", and \"In My Feelings\".[8] Drake's widely anticipated sixth album, *Certified Lover Boy* (2021), achieved nine top 10 hits on the Hot 100, setting the then-record for most US top-ten hits from one album, with its lead single \"Way 2 Sexy\" reaching number one.[9] In 2022, Drake released the house-inspired album *Honestly, Nevermind* and the collaborative album, *Her Loss*, with 21 Savage. His eighth album *For All the Dogs* (2023) yielded the number-one songs \"Slime You Out\" and \"First Person Shooter\", with which he tied Michael Jackson for the most number-one singles by a male solo artist.[10] Known for frequent accompanying releases to his albums, Drake achieved critical and commercial success with the mixtapes *If You're Reading This It's Too Late* (2015) and *More Life* (2017).\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Drake founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012. In 2013, Drake became the \"global ambassador\" of the Toronto Raptors, joining their executive committee and later obtaining naming rights to their practice facility. In 2016, he began collaborating with Brent Hocking on the bourbon whiskey Virginia Black.[11] Drake heads the OVO fashion label and the Nocta collaboration with Nike, and founded the production company DreamCrew and the fragrance house Better World. In 2018, Drake was reportedly responsible for 5 percent (CAD$440 million) of Toronto's CAD$8.8 billion annual tourism income.[12] In 2022, he obtained partial ownership of Italian soccer club A.C. Milan.\n\n\nAmong the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold, Drake is ranked as the highest-certified digital singles artist in the United States by the RIAA.[13] He has won five Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, a record 34 *Billboard* Music Awards, two Brit Awards, and three Juno Awards. Drake has achieved 13 number-one hits on the *Billboard* Hot 100 (14 counting \"Sicko Mode\") and holds further Hot 100 records, including the most top 10 singles (76), most charted songs (321),[14] and the most continuous time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks).[a] He additionally has the most number-one singles on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot Rap Songs, and Rhythmic Airplay charts. \n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFor high school, Drake attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right).\n\nAubrey Drake Graham[15] was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African-American Catholic drummer from Memphis who once performed with country musician Jerry Lee Lewis.[16][17] His mother, Sandra \"Sandi\" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian Ashkenazi Jew, who worked as an English teacher and florist.[18][19][20][21][22] Graham performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he met Sandra, who was in attendance.[17] Drake is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada, the former derived from Graham.[23][24][25] In his youth, he attended a Jewish day school and became a bar mitzvah.[26][27]\n\n\nDrake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto; his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges.[28] Graham's limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the U.S. until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, Graham would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer.[29][30][31] Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell music,[32] which Drake vehemently denies.[33]\n\n\nDrake was raised in two neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in Toronto's working-class west end until grade six and attended Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[30][34] Drake was a promising right winger, reaching the Upper Canada College hockey camp, but left at the behest of his mother following a vicious cross-check to his neck during a game by an opposing player.[35] He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.[36][37] When asked about the move, Drake replied, \"[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.\"[38] Demonstrating an affinity for the arts, at age 10, Drake appeared in a comedic sketch which aired during the 1997 NHL Awards, featuring a riff of Martin Brodeur and Ron Hextall and their record as being the only goalies to have scored multiple goals.[39]\n\n\nHe attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute for high school,[40] and then attended Vaughan Road Academy in Toronto's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood; Drake described Vaughan Road Academy as \"not by any means the easiest school to go to.\"[30] During his teenage years, Drake worked at a now-closed Toronto furniture factory owned by his maternal grandfather, Reuben Sher.[41] Drake said he was bullied at school for his racial and religious background,[42] and upon determining that his class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, he dropped out of school.[43] Drake received his high school diploma in October 2012.[44]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2001–2009: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\n#### *Degrassi: The Next Generation*[edit]\n\n\nAt the age of 15, Drake, eager to begin his career as an actor, was introduced to a high school friend's father, an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on the Canadian teen drama series *Degrassi: The Next Generation*. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks,[45] a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. Drake reportedly disliked this character arc because of its apparent tokenism (his was one of the only black characters in the series), and also believed it could negatively influence his standing as a rapper. Madeleine Robinson, the executive director of the Californian non-profit organization Wheelchair 4 Kids, praised the storyline and Drake's performance, noting \"he instilled confidence and representation\" to disabled youth.[46] When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, \"My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was [from] Canadian TV.\"[30]\n\n\nAccording to *Degrassi* series creators Stephen Stohn and Linda Schuyler, Drake regularly arrived late on set after spending nights recording music. To prevent this, Schuyler claimed Drake struck an agreement with the set's security guards to gain entry to the set after recording to be allowed to sleep in a dressing room.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Early mixtapes and *So Far Gone*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: So Far Gone (mixtape)\n\n![](image)Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, signed Drake to the label in 2009.[48]\nBeing musically inspired by Jay-Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, *Room for Improvement*, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco and included vast production from Boi-1da and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as \"pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it.\" *Room for Improvement* was released for sale only and sold roughly 6,000 copies,[45] for which Drake received $304.04 in royalties.[49] He performed his first concert on August 19, 2006, at the Kool Haus nightclub as an opening act for Ice Cube, performing for half an hour and earning $100.[50] In 2007, Drake released his second mixtape *Comeback Season*. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single \"Replacement Girl\" featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video on BET, with \"Replacement Girl\" featured on their \"New Joint of the Day\" segment in April 2007.[51] The song also saw Drake sample \"Man of the Year\" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston to join his *Tha Carter III* tour.[52] Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including \"Ransom\", \"Forever\", and a remix to \"Brand New\".[52]\n\n\nIn 2009, Drake released his third mixtape *So Far Gone*. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success from the singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Successful\", both gaining Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[53] This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs \"I'm Goin' In\" and \"Fear\". It debuted at number six on the *Billboard* 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.[54]\n\n\nDue to the success of the mixtape,[55] Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as \"one of the biggest bidding wars ever\".[56] Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009.[57] This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized fake album titled *The Girls Love Drake* released on iTunes.[58][*vague*]\n\n\nDrake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009.[59] However, during a performance of \"Best I Ever Had\" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.[60] He underwent surgery later that year.\n\n\n\n### 2010–2012: Musical breakthrough with *Thank Me Later* and *Take Care*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Thank Me Later and Take Care (album)\n\n![](image)Drake at Bumbershoot in 2010\nDrake planned to release his debut album, *Thank Me Later*, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010,[61] and then to May 25, 2010.[62] Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks for a June 15, 2010, release.[61][63]\n\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Drake released the lead single \"Over\",[64] which peaked at number fourteen on the *Billboard* Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[65] His second single, \"Find Your Love\", became an even bigger success. It peaked at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified 3x Multi-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[66] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, \"care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image].\"[67] The third single and fourth singles, \"Miss Me\" and \"Fancy\" respectively,[68] attained moderate commercial success; however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.[69] On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished *Thank Me Later* during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.[70]\n\n\n*Thank Me Later* was released on June 15, 2010,[71] debuting at number one on the *Billboard* 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week.[72] Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by the police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds.[73] The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010 and had the highest sales week for any debut album in the 2010s[74] and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West,[75] and Jay Z.[76]\n\n\nIt was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in the military science fiction video game, *Gears of War 3*. He was scheduled to play the role of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour[77] prevented him from accepting the role.[78] He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs.[79] It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010.[80] Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire, on May 8, and he also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.[77][81]\n\n\nBeginning his second effort in fall 2010,[82] Drake announced his intentions to allow Noah \"40\" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on *Thank Me Later*, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others.[83] In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be *Take Care*.[82] In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that *Thank Me Later* was a rushed album, stating, \"I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed a lot of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called *Take Care*, because I get to take my time this go-round.\"[84] Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic esthetic of *Thank Me Later*.[85][86] Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drake performing with Bun B in 2011\nIn January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's *Arbitrage*,[88] before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie to focus on the album. \"Dreams Money Can Buy\"[89] and \"Marvins Room\"[85] were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for *Take Care*, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while \"Marvins Room\" gained 3x Multi-Platinum certification by the RIAA,[90] as well as peaking at number 21 on the *Billboard* Hot 100,[91] and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,[92] coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio.[93] Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.[94]\n\n\n\"Headlines\" was released on August 9 as the lead single for *Take Care*. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the *Billboard* Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12.[95] It was eventually certified 4x Multi-Platinum in the United States and Platinum in Canada.[96] The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012.[97] \"Make Me Proud\" was released as the album's second single on October 16.[98] It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100.[91] The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the *Billboard* Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88.[99] \"Make Me Proud\" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.[100]\n\n\nPrior to the album's release, Drake planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne; however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of *Watch the Throne*.[101][102][103] He also began collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled *Y.O.L.O.*, but the duo decided against the project in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.[104][105] Although in 2021, Ross stated that a joint album is still possible as they've casually discussed it.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drake during a performance in Toronto in 2011\n*Take Care* was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[107] John McDonnell of *NME* dubbed it \"an affecting masterpiece\" and commended its \"delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics.\"[108] *Pitchfork*'s Ryan Dombal found Drake's \"technical abilities\" to be improved and stated, \"Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up.\"[109] Andy Hutchins of *The Village Voice* called it \"a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West.\"[110] *Chicago Tribune* writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's \"moral psychodramas\" and stated, \"the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power.\"[111] It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified six times platinum by the RIAA in 2019, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the U.S.[112]\n\n\nThe album's third and fourth singles, \"The Motto\" and Take Care\", were released on November 29, 2011[113] and February 21, 2012, respectively.[114] Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with \"The Motto\" credited for popularizing the phrase \"YOLO\" in the United States.[115][116] The music video for \"Take Care\" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, \"None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] – make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it.\"[117] The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year.[118] The song was also featured on the channel's \"Pop Songs You Must Hear\" list of 2011.[119] \"HYFR\" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified 2x Multi-Platinum.[120][121] It also won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012,[27][122] and the channel ranked him number two on their \"Hottest MCs in the Game\" list.[123]\n\n\nOn August 5, 2012, Drake released \"Enough Said\", performed by American recording artist Aaliyah featuring additional vocals provided by himself.[124] Originally recorded prior to the singer's death in a plane crash in 2001, Drake later finished the track with producer \"40\". \"Enough Said\" was released by Blackground Records through their SoundCloud account on August 5, 2012.[125] It was sent to US urban and rhythmic radio stations on August 21.[126] The song charted at number 55 on the *Billboard* Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\n\nIn promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million.[127] He then returned to acting, starring in *Ice Age: Continental Drift* as Ethan.[128]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2015: *Nothing Was the Same* and *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Nothing Was the Same and If You're Reading This It's Too Late\n\nDuring the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album.[129] Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from *Take Care*, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.[130]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off his third album at the end of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards.[131][132] Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing *Nothing Was the Same* as the title of his third album.[133] The album's second single, \"Hold On, We're Going Home\", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off the album, peaking at number one on the *Billboard* Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[134] and being certified 6x Multi-Platinum by the RIAA in 2018[135] Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series *Miami Vice* during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video.[136][137][138] Drake appeared on *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*, performing the album's third single, \"Too Much\", alongside featured artist Sampha.[139]\n\n\n*Nothing Was the Same* was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US *Billboard* 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release.[140] The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favourable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in Kanye West's *808s & Heartbreak*.[141] The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the \"Would You like a Tour?\" throughout late 2013 to early 2014.[142] It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million.[143] Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting *Saturday Night Live*, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what \"kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters\".[144][145][146] Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city.[147] In late 2014, Drake announced that he began recording sessions for his fourth studio album.[148]\n\n\nIn 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song \"Odio\". He also appeared on a remix of \"Tuesday\" by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's *Rhythmic* chart and number twelve on the \"Hot 100\", and released \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.\n\n\nOn February 12, 2015, Drake released *If You're Reading This It's Too Late* onto iTunes with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it was an album[149] or a mixtape,[150] its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumoured to allow Drake to leave the label.[151][152] However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and *If You're Reading This It's Too Late* sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall.[112]\n\n\n\n### 2015–2017: *What a Time to Be Alive*, *Views*, and *More Life*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: What a Time to Be Alive, Views (album), and More Life\n\nOn July 31, 2015, Drake released four singles: \"Back to Back\", \"Charged Up\", \"Hotline Bling\", and \"Right Hand\".

The album was originally titled *Views from the 6*, but was later shortened to *Views*.[159] \"Summer Sixteen\" debuted at number six on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as \"goodly brash\" or \"conventionally disrespectful.\"[160][161][162] It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake for popularizing the term \"The Six\" when referencing Toronto.[163][164]\n\n\nDrake soon released the album's lead singles, \"Pop Style\" and the dancehall-infused \"One Dance\", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the *Billboard* Hot 100;[165] however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with \"One Dance\" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist.[166][167] The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands.[168][169] During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos.[170] On October 15, \"One Dance\" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016[update].[171] it also became the first song in history to hit 1 billion streams on spotify on December 16, 2016[172]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drake performing at the Summer Sixteen Tour in Toronto in 2016\n*Views* was previewed in London before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later.

It also achieved sextuple-platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album.[175][176][177] Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries.[178] He later released a short film titled *Please Forgive Me*, starring Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta who are frequent collaborators with him.[179] As of 2019[update], *Views* remains Drake's best-selling album in pure sales.[180]\n\n\nDrake returned to host *Saturday Night Live* on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest.[181] Later, Drake was named as a member of the *Forbes Five,* which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively.[182] Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums.

This dethroned the previous record of $75.6 million through 63 dates for the Watch the Throne Tour.[189]\n\n\nDuring the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album.[190] Soon after, the music video for \"Child's Play\" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics.[191] On September 26, *Please Forgive Me* was released as an Apple Music exclusive.

On September 16, 2023, Drake announced that the album is postponed to October 6.[350] On October 5, 2023, Drake surprise-released a song titled \"8AM in Charlotte\" on his social media accounts making it the albums second released single.[351]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nDrake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West,[352] Jay-Z,[353] MF Doom,[354] and Lil Wayne,[355] while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah[356] and Usher.[357] Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his \"biggest inspirations\".[358][359] He has been credited with performing and attracting fans from many cultures such as Spanish in the song Mia,[360] Arabic in the song Greece,[361] Portuguese in Ela É do Tipo,[362] French in Sticky[363] and Punjabi in an upcoming song with Sidhu Moose Wala and Wazir Patar.[364][365][366][367]\n\n\n\n### Musical style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDrake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences.\n\nDrake is considered to be a pop rap artist.[368] While Drake's earlier music primarily spanned hip hop and R&B, his music has delved into pop and trap since the albums *Nothing Was the Same* (2013) and *Views* (2016).[369] Additionally, his music has drawn influence from regional scenes, including Jamaican dancehall[359] and UK drill.[260] Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women.[370] His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism.[371]\n\n\nHis songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as \"ting\", \"touching road\", \"talkin' boasy\" and \"gwanin' wassy\".[371] Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing.[372] He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.[373] Drake's style of R&B is characterized by vacant beats and a rap-sung dichotomy, which has also seen incredible mainstream success, spawing several imitators.[374]\n\n\nThe lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional[375] or boastful.[376] However, Drake is often revered for incorporating \"degrading\" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between \"pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata.\"[377] Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as \"hyper-reality rap\", characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as distinct from the \"real world.\"[378]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A wax figure of Drake in Madame Tussauds, London\nDrake's lyrical subject matter, which often revolves around relationships, have had widespread use on social media through photo captions to reference emotions or personal situations.[379] However, this content has incited mixed reception from fans and critics, with some deeming him as sensitive and inauthentic, traits perceived as antithetical to traditional hip hop culture.[380][381] He is also known for his large and extravagant lifestyle, including for high-end themed birthday parties;[382] he maintained this image in his early career by renting a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which he was eventually gifted in 2021.[383] He cultivated a reputation as a successful gambler; between December 2021 and February 2022, he was reported to have made bets of over $1 billion, which included winnings ranging between $354,000 and $7 million,[384] however some of the forms of gambling he promotes, such as roulette, have negative expected values.[385]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase \"YOLO\" in the United States with his single \"The Motto\", which stands for, \"You only live once.\"[386] Drake later popularized the term \"The Six\" in 2015 in relation to his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city.[387] June 10 was declared \"Drake Day\" in Houston.[388][389][390] In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance.[391][392] According to a report from Confused.com, Drake's Toronto home was one of the most Googled homes in the world, recording over a million annual searches in 2021; its features, such as its NBA-size indoor basketball court and Kohler Numi toilet, have also received widespread media attention.[393]\n\n\nThe music video for \"Hotline Bling\" went viral due to Drake's eccentric dance moves.[394] The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to the unconventional nature on the song,[395] causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, and spawning several parodies.[396] Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exemplified by the video for \"Hotline Bling\". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6\" Classic Boots.[397][398] He was labeled by *GQ* magazine as \"[one of] the most stylish men alive\";[399] during promotion for *Certified Lover Boy*, Drake debuted a \"heart haircut\", which became popular and widely imitated.[400] Writing for *GQ*, Anish Patel noted Drake's consistent incorporation of styles and themes not typically associated with hip hop, such as wearing gorpcore in the music video for his song \"Sticky\".[401] Between 2016 and 2019, Drake was noted for the \"Drake curse\", an internet meme based on the incidents where he appears to be support of particular sports team or person, just for that team or person to lose, often against the odds.[402]\n\n\nIn 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States.[403] In 2021, he joined a group of Canadian musicians to work with the Songwriters Association of Canada (SAC) to lobby Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to restructure the country's copyright law to allow artists and their families to regain ownership of copyrights during their lifetime.[404] He also campaigned for the expansion of a Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) franchise in Toronto,[405] and headlined a benefit concert at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with Kanye West on December 9, 2021, to raise clemency for Larry Hoover,[406] although his solo performance was later removed from the Prime Video replay.[407] On Christmas 2021, Drake gave away money to individuals in Toronto.[408] In October 2023, he signed a letter calling for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Gaza war.[409]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nA prominent figure in pop culture,[410] Drake is often praised one of the most influential figures in hip hop;[411] particularly his use of singing over hip hop instrumentals has been noted as an influence on modern rappers.[412] He is widely credited for popularizing the Toronto sound to the music industry and leading the \"Canadian Invasion\", a play on the British Invasion in the 1960s, of the American charts — alongside the likes of Justin Bieber and The Weeknd.[413][414][415][416][417] In 2022, music recognition app Shazam revealed Drake to be their most searched artist by users, with music featuring Drake collecting 350 million recognitions; his 2016 single \"One Dance\" collected 17 million recognitions alone.[418]\n\n\n*The Insider* declared Drake the artist of the decade (2010s).[411] Regarding the general view that Drake introduced singing in mainstream hip hop, the publication said that at the height of Auto-Tune in hip hop during the late 2000s, \"there were virtually no artists who were both a legit rapper and a legit crooner who delivered velvety smooth pop/R&B hybrid vocals that could exist separately from his hip-hop songs.\"[411] Commenting on Drake's *Take Care*, Elias Leight of *Rolling Stone* noticed in 2020 that \"now nearly every singer raps, and nearly every rapper sings\", as many artists \"have borrowed or copied the template of [the album] that the boldness of the original is easily forgotten\", according to the writer.[419]\n\n\nAaron Williams of Uproxx added \"jump-starting the sad boy rapper craze alongside Kid Cudi\" and \"helping to renew stateside interest in UK grime and Caribbean dancehall with Skepta, PartyNextDoor, and Rihanna\" to the modern trends Drake assisted.[420] BBC Radio 1Xtra argued that his co-signs helped push the British hip-hop scene to a wider international market, as he did with the Toronto music scene.[421] According to CBS Music in 2019, Drake has inspired \"the next wave\" of artists coming out of his hometown.[422] Writing for *Bloomberg*, Lucas Shaw commented Drake's popularity has influenced the promotion of music, with *Certified Lover Boy* attaining large commercial success despite relatively minimal orthodox marketing techniques, stating \"fans are consuming Drake's [music] in a way that is different to others\".[423] He also noted the album as novel in relation to consumption, with each song having relatively equivalent streams, as opposed to a dominant single(s).[423] Justin Charity of The Ringer noted Drake's signature of producing \"half-hearted\" performances on songs to create a \"natural and off-the-cuff\" effect has become the \"obvious touchpoint for [subsequent] male R&B singers\".[374] Charity further wrote Drake's success in the genre is \"so thorough that it's all but impossible to hear certain vintages of R&B without hearing Drake\".[374]\n\n\nBeginning in 2022, Drake's music was canonized academically by Toronto Metropolitan University, which began teaching courses titled \"Deconstructing Drake and the Weeknd\", with the pair's music used to explore themes related to the Canadian music industry, race, class, marketing and globalization.[424] With the release during LGBT Pride Month of his seventh album *Honestly, Nevermind* (2022), Mark Savage of the BBC wrote Drake's exploration of house, a genre with overt origins in black and queer spaces, would help \"build a bridge to those [origin] subcultures\" for younger music listeners.[425]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Drake\n\nDrake is the highest-certified digital singles artist ever in the United States, having moved 142 million units based on combined sales and on-demand streams.[13][426] His highest-certified single is \"God's Plan\" (15× Platinum), followed by \"Hotline Bling\" and \"One Dance, which are certified Diamond.[427] Drake was Spotify's most streamed artist of the 2010s.[428]\n\n\nHe holds several *Billboard* Hot 100 chart records; he has the most charted songs of any artist (321,[14][429] the most simultaneously charted songs in a single week (27),[298] the most number-one debuts (9),[14][429] the most debuts in a week (22),[430] the most top 10 singles (76),[14][429] the most top 10 debuts (61),[14][429] the most top 10 singles in a calendar year (13),[14][429] the most cumulative weeks in the top 10 (384),[14][429] the most songs peaking at number-two (10) (11 including his appearance as a member of Young Money on \"BedRock\"),[14][429] and the most consecutive weeks spent on the chart (431 weeks).[14][429] He has accumulated 13 number-one songs (14 including his uncredited feature on \"Sicko Mode\"), a record among rappers.[431] In 2021, Drake became second act to occupy the entire Hot 100's top five in a single week, the other act being The Beatles in 1964.[299] He also has the most number-one singles on the Hot Rap Songs (23), Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (23),[299] and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay.[432] He is also the only artist to have two albums log 400 weeks each on the *Billboard* 200.[433]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Drake has won four Grammy Awards from 47 nominations.[434] He has also won a record 29 *Billboard* Music Awards. In 2017, he surpassed Adele's record for most wins at the Billboard Music Awards in one night, winning 13 awards from 22 nominations.[204] He was named Artist of the Decade at the 2021 *Billboard* Music Awards.[290] *Billboard* editor Ernest Baker stated \"Drake managed to rule hip-hop in 2014\", adding \"the best rapper in 2014 didn't need a new album or hit single to prove his dominance\".[435] From 2015 to 2017, Drake ranked within the top-five of the *Billboard* Year-End chart for Top Artists,[436][437][438] before topping it in 2018.[439] He was named the IFPI Global Recording Artist of 2016 and 2018.[440]\n\n\n*Pitchfork* ranked *Nothing Was the Same* as the 41st best album of the decade \"so far\"—between 2010 and 2014,[441] and ranked him fifth in the publication's list of the \"Top 10 Music Artists\" since 2010.[442][443] *Take Care* was ranked at number 95 on *Rolling Stone*'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2020).[419] He has been ranked by *Complex* on their \"Best Rapper Alive Every Year Since 1979\" list, awarding Drake the accolade in 2011, 2012, and 2015.[444]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn May 31, 2009, Drake was robbed at gunpoint in Toronto's Little Italy district and was forced to forfeit a gold and diamond necklace, an Audemars Piguet watch, and $2,000. Soccerties Cotterell and Paul Lelutiu were initially charged with armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, three counts of pointing a firearm and possession of stolen property. All charges were later dropped, except conspiracy to commit armed robbery, to which the men pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to time served, amounting to just over six months in jail.[445] In April 2017, Mesha Collins was arrested for criminal trespass after breaking into Drake's home in Calabasas; although no criminal charges were brought, Collins filed a $4 billion lawsuit against Drake for defamation in June 2021,[446] which was dismissed that December.[447] Drake then filed a restraining order against Collins in March 2022,[448] which was granted that April.[449] In March 2021, an unidentified woman armed with a knife was arrested after a failed attempt to break into Drake's Toronto home.[450] In January 2023, a man was arrested for burglarizing Drake's L.A. home.[451]\n\n\nIn 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on \"Marvins Room\". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties.[452] Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement.[453] In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling \"Jimmy Smith Rap\", a 1982 single by jazz musician Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who said Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on \"Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2\", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop.[454][455] Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement.[456] Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics when collaborating with YG on the song \"Who Do You Love?\". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year.[457] In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.[458] In December 2021, Drake sued jeweler Ori Vechler and his company Gemma LTD for incorrectly using his likeness in promotional material; he also sought to return three items he purchased.[459] In December 2022, a lawsuit brought by rapper Angelou Skywalker, who alleged that Drake stole his song \"Reach for Skies\" to make \"Way 2 Sexy\", was dismissed following \"repeated misconduct\" by Skywalker against prosecutors and U.S. district judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who presided over the case; Skywalker was accused of filing no less than 50 irrelevant motions and was handed a restraining order, preventing contact with Drake.[460]\n\n\nIn 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel \"Chubbs\" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also said the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering.[461] The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference. Lu ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.[462]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Drake, Odell Beckham Jr., and Younes Bendjima were sued by a man named Bennett Sipes in regards to an alleged assault that occurred outside of a L.A. nightclub in 2018. Sipes claims he suffered \"traumatic brain injury, as well as injuries to his back, neck, shoulders, etc.\" on March 24, 2018, when he was attacked by Bendjima, as well as members of Drake and Beckham's entourages in an alley near the nightclub and sought $250,000 in damages. The suit alleges Drake and Beckham followed their respective crews to the alley to watch Sipes get attacked. A video of the incident was recorded using the on-site surveillance system.[463] The suit was eventually settled out of court.[464]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Drake and Chris Brown were sued by Braindon Cooper and Timothy Valentine for copyright infringement between \"No Guidance\" and their own song \"I Love Your Dress\",[465][466][467] but Drake was dropped by Cooper and Valentine from the lawsuit in April 2022.[468] Drake was handed another copyright lawsuit from Samuel Nicholas, citing infringement from Drake's \"In My Feelings\" and \"Nice For What\".[469] That November, he was named co-defendant with Travis Scott in a multi-claimant lawsuit for inciting \"a riot and violence\" at the Astroworld Festival,[470] to which he released a statement;[471] he reportedly delayed the release of \"Splash Brothers\", a collaboration with French Montana, as a result.[472]\n\n\nOn July 14, 2022, Drake was detained by Swedish police, reportedly stemming from drugs present within a Stockholm nightclub.[473] That November, Drake and 21 Savage were sued by Condé Nast, the publisher of *Vogue*, for using the *Vogue* name without permission to promote their collaborative album *Her Loss*;[474][475] Drake and 21 Savage \"voluntarily ceased\" to a preliminary injunction to stop using *Vogue* trademarks to promote the album,[476] and later reached a settlement with Condé Nast.[477] In February 2023, Drake was ordered to appear for a deposition in the XXXTentacion murder trial after the defense team for Dedrick Williams — one of the three suspects — listed Drake as a potential witness, related to the purported feud between Drake and XXXTentacion; Drake was subpoenaed the month prior, and failed to show for his scheduled deposition date of January 27; the rescheduled deposition was set for February 24.[478] It was later reported that armed guards at Drake's Beverly Hills home refused to accept the service of the deposition on February 14, which Drake's lawyer, Bradon Cohen, argued was not properly served in compliance with California law and done solely to \"inject celebrity spectacle in a routine trial\", ultimately leading to the deposition being dismissed.[479]\n\n\n\n### Feuds[edit]\n\n\nDrake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012 when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident, and criticized Drake in music until 2013, including on the \"R.I.P.\" remix.[480][481][482] Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.[483] The pair later collaborated on \"No Guidance\" in 2019.[484]\n\n\nIn December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute.[485] Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments about him during an interview with *Vibe* magazine.[486] Drake would later respond on \"6 God\" and \"6PM in New York\", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.[487]\n\n\nFurther controversy arose in July 2015 when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for \"RICO\", one of the lead singles off Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller.[488] Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for \"R.I.C.O.\" Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for \"R.I.C.O.\", \"10 Bands\", and \"Know Yourself\". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled \"Charged Up\"[489] and \"Back to Back\",[490] in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with \"Wanna Know\",[491] before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later.[492] Following several subliminal disses[493][494][495] from either artist,[496] Drake further sought to denounce Funkmaster Flex while performing in New York (Flex's home state) on the Summer Sixteen Tour.[497][498] Following Mill's prison sentencing for probation violation, Drake stated \"Free Meek Mill\" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on \"Family Feud\";[499] the pair later collaborated on \"Going Bad\" in 2019.[500]\n\n\nPusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on \"Infrared\" in 2018,[501] leading Drake to respond with the \"Duppy Freestyle\" diss track on May 25.[502] Pusha T responded with \"The Story of Adidon\" on May 29, which presented several claims and revealed Drake's fatherhood.[503] The pair are considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, resulting from Pusha T's feuds with Lil Wayne and Birdman, with Drake yet to respond to \"The Story of Adidon\".[504]\n\n\nIn 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing *Views*. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through \"4PM in Calabasas\", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on \"No Shopping\" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song, although, Montana claimed Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake,[505] he has yet to officially respond to Budden.[506] In the same year, Drake dissed Kid Cudi on \"Two Birds, One Stone\" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter.[507] Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets;[508] the pair eventually resolved their feud, and collaborated on \"IMY2\" in 2021.[509]\n\n\nIn mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator Kanye West.[510] In an appearance on *The Shop*, Drake recounted several meetings with West, who voiced his desire to \"be Quincy Jones\" and work with Drake and replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson.[511] West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, while he gave Drake the instrumental to \"Lift Yourself\".[512] West requested the pair work in Wyoming, with Drake arriving a day after close friend 40, who said West was instead recording an album. Judging the pair to have differing release schedules, Drake traveled to Wyoming,[513] but \"only worked on [West's] music\"; they explored Drake's after he played West \"March 14\", which addressed Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent.[514] This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T,[515] which Drake concluded was revealed to him by West; West also released \"Lift Yourself\" as a solo song and produced \"Infrared\". Drake then denounced West in songs and live performances.[516][517] West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018, and the pair continued to respond on social media and in music as of late 2021,[518] which included Drake leaking West's song \"Life of the Party\".[519] During their feud, West also made several public attempts to reconcile with Drake,[520] which is reported to have occurred after they co-headlined a benefit concert in December 2021.[521]\n\n\nDrake has also been involved in reported feuds with DMX, music critic Anthony Fantano,[522][523][524] Kendrick Lamar,[525] Common,[526] The Weeknd,[527] XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez,[528] and Ludacris,[529] although the latter five, and his feud with DMX, have been reported to be resolved.[530][531][532]\n\n\n\n## Business ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nPrior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient.[533][534] In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King, White Castle and Whataburger.[535] Business magazine *Forbes* commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships \"combined heavily\" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.[536] Drake receives an endorsement of $100 million per annum from the gambling firm Stake.com.[537]\n\n\n\n### OVO Sound[edit]\n\n\nMain article: OVO Sound\n\n![](image)The logo of Drake's OVO Sound imprint\nDuring the composition of *Nothing Was the Same*, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah \"40\" Shebib and business partner Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound.[538] The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects.

The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, Roy Woods, and dvsn,[539] as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince.\n\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toronto Raptors\n\nOn September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke,[540] Drake was announced as the new \"global ambassador\" of the Toronto Raptors, joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise. It was announced together with the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.[541][542][543] This was also the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City.[544] In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary.[540][545][546][547] He also collaborated with the Raptors on pre-game practice jerseys, t-shirts, and sweatsuits,[548] and began hosting an annual \"Drake Night\" segment with the organization, beginning in 2013.[549]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\n#### Apple Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Music\n\nFollowing the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million.[550] This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers.[551] Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted *More Life*.[552] Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services.[553] Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.[554]\n\n\n\n#### DreamCrew and investments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: DreamCrew\n\nIn 2017, Drake and Adel \"Future\" Nur co-founded the production company DreamCrew, with functions in both management and entertainment. The company has produced the television series *Euphoria* and *Top Boy*.[555] Their debut produced film was sports documentary *The Carter Effect*, detailing the impact of Vince Carter in Canada.[556] On August 5, 2022, Drake was among those nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series for acting as a producer on *Euphoria*.[557]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Drake was announced as an executive producer, alongside LeBron James and Maverick Carter, for *Black Ice*, a documentary film charting the experiences of black and ethnic minority professional and amateur ice hockey players. It is due to be produced by Uninterrupted Canada in partnership with Drake's DreamCrew Entertainment, James' SpringHill Company, and Bell Media.[558] DreamCrew also began production on the unscripted survival series *Chillin' Island* in 2021, due to air on HBO.[559] In June 2021, Live Nation confirmed a long-standing partnership with Drake to open History, a 2,500 convertible capacity live-entertainment and general function venue in Toronto. It was in development for over three years and is situated in The Beaches.[560] He also aided in the venue's interior design, which contains LED screens, soundproofing, quick-change rooms and a customizable staircase.[561] In November 2022, DreamCrew invested near-$100 million to revive the open-air museum and amusement park *Luna Luna*; originally staged in Hamburg, it is set to go on a worldwide tour, with Drake stating, \"[Luna Luna] is such a unique and special way to experience art. This is a big idea and opportunity that centers around what we love most: bringing people together\".[562]\n\n\nDrake signed as an investor and collaborator with Los Angeles-based sustainability and financial services startup Aspiration; he will also use the company's enterprise services to monitor and ensure personal carbon neutrality.[563] He has also invested in robo-advisor Wealthsimple, the \"livestreaming video commerce platform\" NTWRK, the cannabis provider Bullrider, and several sports-related ventures, including online esports betting platform Players' Lounge, the sportstech firm StatusPro, and online sports network Overtime.[564] In an analysis by Brennan Doherty for *Toronto Star*, Drake's investment \"carry all the hallmarks\" typical of musicians, which is often momentum investing, and cited Jason Pereira, who described Drake's business deals as typically angel investing and private equity (often venture capital) funds. Pereira also noted his \"leveraging his personal brand to generate cash\".[564] On August 30, 2022, it was reported that Drake and LeBron James, as part of the investment fund Main Street Advisors, would partner with U.S. private equity group RedBird Capital and Yankee Global Enterprises to purchase Italian soccer club A.C. Milan for a rumored $1.2 billion.[565] Drake has also invested in cryptocurrency and NFT payment solutions firm MoonPay.[566]\n\n\n\n#### 100 Thieves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 100 Thieves\n\nIn 2018, Drake purchased an ownership stake in the gaming organization 100 Thieves, joining as a co-founder and co-owner. The investment was partly funded by music executive Scooter Braun and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert.[567][568]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Virginia Black Whiskey\n\nTwo months prior to the release of *Views*, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey.[569] This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant and Antonio Park to open the sports bar Pick 6ix, both in Toronto and eventually closed.[570][571] Virginia Black was created and distributed by Proximo Spirits and Brent Hocking,[572] a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008.[573] The company described the partnership as \"fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.\"[574] In 2021, using ratings compiled from Vivino and complimentary website Distiller, Virginia Black was ranked the worst value celebrity liquor for quality and price.[575]\n\n\nThe product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically.[576] The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the \"Virginia Black VIP Lounge\" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016.[577] The company later aired commercials with Drake's father, Dennis Graham, which featured the mock tagline of \"The Realest Dude Ever\" (in reference toward \"The Most Interesting Man in the World\" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to Europe in 2017.[211] In 2019, Drake began collaborating with Hocking on Mod Sélection, a luxury range of champagne,[578] and in May 2021, formed part of a $40 million series B investment funding round led by D1 Capital Partners in Daring Foods Inc., a vegan meat analogue corporation.[579] That September, he purchased a minority stake in Californian food chain Dave's Hot Chicken,[580] and organized a promotion on October 24, 2022, to give away free chicken to Toronto residents on his 36th birthday.[581]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Drake announced he was signing with Nike and Air Jordan, saying \"growing up, I'm sure we all idolized Michael Jordan. I [am] officially inducted into the Team Jordan family.\"[582] Drake also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the \"Air Jordan OVOs\".[583] This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose,[584] in which various items of clothing were produced.[585] In 2020, A Bathing Ape announced a collaboration with Drake, releasing an OVO x BAPE collection of clothing,[586] while he also partnered with candle manufacturer Revolve to create \"Better World Fragrance\", a line of scented candles.[587][588]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Drake announced Nocta, a sub-label with Nike. In a press release, Drake said \"I always felt like there was an opportunity for Nike to embrace an entertainer the same way [as] athletes,\" he wrote, \"to be associated with the highest level possible was always my goal.\"[589] The apparel line is named after Drake's \"nocturnal creative process\", in which Nike described as a \"collection for the collective\", and noted by GQ as \"fashion-forward, minimal-inspired sportswear\".[590] One clothing item features an image of Drake's muses, Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta, with a poem.[591] After the first collection sold out, another was released in February 2021, which introduced t-shirts, adjustable caps, a utility vest, and a lightweight jacket.[592] That July, OVO released the \"Weekender Collection\", which includes a line of hoodies, velour sweatsuits, t-shirts, shorts, and accessories for women.[593] OVO then released a \"Winter Survival Collection\" that December which included puffer jackets, vests, and parkas made with 700-fill down and Oeko-Tex certified down feathers.[594] They followed this with limited *Jurassic Park*-themed collection and an indoor footwear collaboration with Suicoke,[595] as well as a Playboy-collaborated capsule collection.[596]\n\n\nIn July 2022, a capsule inspired by and in collaboration with Mike Tyson was released, featuring both blouson jackets and caps.[597] In conjunction with Spotify's 12-year, $540 million sponsorship deal with FC Barcelona, the club wore special edition OVO owl silhouette branded jerseys in their El Clásico match against Real Madrid CF on October 16, 2022.[598] OVO then partnered with former professional ice hockey player Tie Domi and fashion retailer Roots Canada to release a capsule collection on October 28, matching Domi's jersey number for the New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs;[599] a capsule collection was later released in collaboration with the Maple Leafs in November.[600]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Health and residences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Boeing 767-200 airplane similar to the one Drake acquired in 2020[601]\nDrake lives in Toronto, Ontario, in a 35,000-square-foot, $100 million estate nicknamed \"The Embassy\",[602] which was built from the ground-up in 2017,[603][604] and is seen in the video to his song \"Toosie Slide\".[605][606] He owned a home nicknamed the \"YOLO Estate\" in Hidden Hills, California, from 2012 to 2022,[607] and bought a Beverly Crest home in 2022 from Robbie Williams for $70 million.[608] He owns a condominium adjacent to the CN Tower.[609] He also owns a Boeing 767,[610][611] and in 2021, rented a $65 million multi-purpose property in Beverly Hills.[612][613][614]\n\n\nDrake has a variety of tattoos, some of which are symbols associated with personal accomplishments, such as a jack-o-lantern, \"October Lejonhjärta\" (transl. October Lionheart), owls, and a controversial *Abbey Road* (1969) inspired depiction of himself and the Beatles.[615] He has portraits of Lil Wayne, Sade, Aaliyah, Jesús Malverde, Denzel Washington, 40, his parents, grandmother, maternal uncle, and son; and several related to Toronto, including the CN Tower and the number \"416\".[616]\n\n\nOn August 18, 2021, Drake revealed he contracted COVID-19 amidst the pandemic, which led to temporary hair loss. He was also one of the first celebrities to publicly test for the virus in March 2020.[617] He contracted the disease again in 2022, causing the postponement of reunion concerts with Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj.[618]\n\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\nDrake's paternal uncles are guitarists and songwriters Larry Graham and Teenie Hodges.[619] Graham was a member of Sly and the Family Stone,[620] while Hodges contributed to songs for Al Green, including \"Love and Happiness\", \"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\", and \"Take Me to the River\".[621][622]\n\n\nDrake has two dogs, a snow white American Bully and an American Akita;[623] he acquired another Akita in 2016, but gave the dog to a trainer not long after due to tour commitments.[624]\n\n\nHe dated SZA between 2008 and 2009,[625] and was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Rihanna from 2009 to 2016.[626] He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums,[627] and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said \"she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old.\"[628] On his relationship with her, he said on the talk show *The Shop*:\n\n\n\n\n> As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale [of] 'Drake started a family with Rihanna, [it's] so perfect.' It looks so good on paper [and] I wanted it too at one time.[629]\n> \n> \n\n\nDrake is a father to a son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French painter and former model Sophie Brussaux.[630][631][632] Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumours after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017.[633] After the nature of the pair's relationship was discussed in Pusha T's \"The Story of Adidon\", Drake confirmed his fatherhood on the album *Scorpion* in 2018, citing a desire for his child's privacy.[631][634]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Drake discography\n\n **Studio albums** \n\n\n\n* *Thank Me Later* (2010)\n* *Take Care* (2011)\n* *Nothing Was the Same* (2013)\n* *Views* (2016)\n* *Scorpion* (2018)\n* *Certified Lover Boy* (2021)\n* *Honestly, Nevermind* (2022)\n* *For All the Dogs* (2023) (reissued as *For All the Dogs Scary Hours Edition*)\n\n**Collaborative albums**\n\n\n\n* *Her Loss* (with 21 Savage) (2022)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* Away from Home Tour (2010)\n* Club Paradise Tour (2012)\n* Would You Like a Tour?

She departed from her country image with *1989* (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\".

She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[405] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[406] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe.

Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[307][308] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[309] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[270] introduced to the genre by \"the great female country artists\" of the 1990s—Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[271][272] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[273] Hill was Swift's childhood role model, as she would often imitate her.[274] She admired the Chicks' defiant attitude and ability to play their own instruments,[275] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[23] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[113] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell's emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell's album *Blue* as a favorite \"because it explores somebody's soul so deeply.\"[276] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn her 2020 albums *Folklore* and *Evermore*, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[373] Without referencing her personal life, she imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[352] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[373] According to *Spin*, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on *Evermore*.[374] *Consequence* stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident

Singers of All Time.[316] In a review of the Eras Tour, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*The New Yorker* critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals.[340]\n\n\n\n### Songwriting[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\n\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time by several publications.[341][342][343] English-language scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and verbal writing style are rare amongst her peers.[344][345] Swift's bridges are often underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs,[346][347] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from *Time*.[348] *Mojo* described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[349]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Taylor's Version* | * \"'Slut!'\"\n* \"Say Don't Go\"\n* \"Now That We Don't Talk\"\n* \"Suburban Legends\"\n* \"Is
