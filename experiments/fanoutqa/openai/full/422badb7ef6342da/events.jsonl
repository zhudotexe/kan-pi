It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\nFor the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 74 directors or directing teams. As of the 2023 ceremony, American filmmaking duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are the most recent winner in this category for their work on *Everything Everywhere All at Once* and the third duo to win after Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins (*West Side Story*) and the Coen brothers (*No Country for Old Men*).\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year.[9] For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31.[10] For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933.[10] Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank Borzage won twice: \"Dramatic director\" at the first ceremony, for *7th Heaven* (1927); & later, *Bad Girl* (1931).\n![](image)Lewis Milestone won twice: \"Comedy director\" at the first ceremony, for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927); & later, *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930).\n![](image)Frank Lloyd won twice, for *The Divine Lady* (1929) & *Cavalcade* (1933).\n![](image)Frank Capra won thrice, for *It Happened One Night* (1934), *Mr. Deeds Goes to Town* (1936), & *You Can't Take It with You* (1938).\n![](image)John Ford won a record four times, for: *The Informer* (1935), *The Grapes of Wrath* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), & *The Quiet Man* (1952).\n![](image)Leo McCarey won twice, for *The Awful Truth* (1937) & *Going My Way* (1944).\n![](image)Victor Fleming won for *Gone with the Wind* (1939).\n![](image)William Wyler, with a record twelve nominations, won thrice, for: *Mrs. Miniver* (1942), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), & *Ben-Hur* (1959).\n![](image)Michael Curtiz won for *Casablanca* (1942).\n![](image)Billy Wilder (*right*, with Gloria Swanson) won twice, for *The Lost Weekend* (1945) & *The Apartment* (1960).\n![](image)Elia Kazan won twice, for *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947) & *On the Waterfront* (1954).\n![](image)John Huston won for *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948).\n![](image)Joseph L.

Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or *de facto* nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges.\n3. **^** Michael Curtiz was not on the original ballot of nominees. However, after the year prior with Bette Davis's omission for *Of Human Bondage*, the resulting furor led to a write-in campaign determined to secure her a nomination. Thus, the Academy relaxed their rules and allowed her performance to be amongst the competition. They permitted this once more, prompting further submissions: Curtiz; Paul Muni for *Black Fury*; and several other categories, including Hal Mohr for *A Midsummer Night's Dream*. Ultimately, Mohr became the only person to win an Oscar as a result of this process. The Academy discontinued this option from the next ceremony forward to prevent any recurrence.\n4. **^** The eligibility period for the 93rd ceremony was extended through to February 28, 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Direction\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director\n* Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Director\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Director\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1927–28 Academy Awards Winners\".

Campion was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DNZM) in the 2016 New Year Honours, for services to film.\n\n\nCampion is a groundbreaking female director, as of 2022[update] the only woman to be nominated twice for Academy Award for Best Director (winning once), and the first female filmmaker to receive the Palme d'Or (for *The Piano*, which also won her the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay).[2] She made history at the 94th Academy Awards when she won Best Director for *The Power of the Dog* (2021), as the oldest female director to win, the first woman to win Academy Awards for both directing and screenwriting in her different films, and the first woman not to win Best Picture after winning Best Director. She broke the same barrier at the 78th Venice International Film Festival when she won the Silver Lion award. She is the third woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Feature Film.\n\n\nCampion is also known for directing the films *An Angel at My Table* (1990), *The Portrait of a Lady* (1996), *Holy Smoke!* (1998), and *Bright Star* (2009). She also co-created the television series *Top of the Lake* (2013) and received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCampion was born in Wellington, New Zealand, the second daughter of Edith Campion (née Beverley Georgette Hannah), an actress, writer, and heiress; and Richard M. Campion, a teacher, and theatre and opera director.[3][4][5] Her maternal great-grandfather was Robert Hannah, a well-known shoe manufacturer for whom Antrim House was built. Her father came from a family that belonged to the fundamentalist Christian Exclusive Brethren sect.[6] She attended Queen Margaret College and Wellington Girls' College.[7] Along with her sister, Anna, a year and a half her senior, and brother, Michael, seven years her junior, Campion grew up in the world of New Zealand theatre.[4] Their parents founded the New Zealand Players.[8] Campion initially rejected the idea of a career in the dramatic arts and graduated instead with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from Victoria University of Wellington in 1975.[4]\n\n\nIn 1976, she enrolled in the Chelsea Art School in London and traveled throughout Europe. She earned a graduate diploma in visual arts (painting) from the Sydney College of the Arts at the University of Sydney in 1981. Campion's later film work was shaped in part by her art school education; she has, even in her mature career, cited painter Frida Kahlo and sculptor Joseph Beuys as influences.[4]\n\n\nCampion's dissatisfaction with the limitations of painting[4] led her to filmmaking and the creation of her first short, *Tissues,* in 1980. In 1981, she began studying at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, where she made several more short films and graduated in 1984.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1982–1989[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jane Campion at the 47th Venice International Film Festival in 1990\nCampion's first short film, *Peel* (1982), won the Short Film *Palme d'Or* at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival,[10] and other awards followed for the shorts *Passionless Moments* (1983), *A Girl's Own Story* (1984), and *After Hours* (1984). After leaving the Australian Film and Television School, she directed an episode for ABC's light entertainment series *Dancing Daze* (1986), which led to her first TV film, *Two Friends* (1986), produced by Jan Chapman.[11] Her feature debut, *Sweetie* (1989), won international awards. \n\n\n\n### 1990–2006[edit]\n\n\nFurther recognition came with *An Angel at My Table* (1990), a biopic about the life of New Zealand writer Janet Frame, from a screenplay written by Laura Jones. Widespread recognition followed with *The Piano* (1993), which won the Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival,[12] Best Director from the Australian Film Institute, and an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1994. At the 66th Academy Awards, Campion was the second woman ever to be nominated for Best Director for her movie *The Piano*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nCampion's 1996 film *The Portrait of a Lady*, based on the Henry James novel, featured Nicole Kidman, John Malkovich, Barbara Hershey and Martin Donovan. *Holy Smoke!* (1999) saw Campion teamed with Harvey Keitel for a second time (the first being *The Piano*), this time with Kate Winslet as the female lead. *In the Cut* (2003), an erotic thriller based on Susanna Moore's bestseller, provided Meg Ryan an opportunity to depart from her more familiar onscreen persona. In 2006 she produced *Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story*. \n\n\n\n### 2009–present[edit]\n\n\nHer 2009 film *Bright Star,* a biographical drama about poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw) and his lover Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), was shown at the Cannes Film Festival.[*citation needed*] In an interview with Jan Lisa Huttner, Campion discussed how she focused on Fanny's side of the story, pointing out that only two of the film's scenes did not feature her.[13] Campion created, wrote, and directed the TV mini-series *Top of the Lake*,[14] which received near universal acclaim,[15][16] won numerous awards—including, for its lead actress Elisabeth Moss, a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries—and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.[17] Campion was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jane Campion in 2014\nShe was the head of the jury for the Cinéfondation and Short Film sections at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival[19] and the head of the jury for the main competition section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[20] When Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan received the Prix du Jury for his film *Mommy*, he said that Campion's *The Piano* \"made me want to write roles for women—beautiful women with soul, will and strength, not victims or objects.\" Campion responded by rising from her seat to give him a hug.[21][22] In 2014, it was announced that Campion was nearing a deal to direct an adaptation of Rachel Kushner's novel *The Flamethrowers*.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 2015, Campion confirmed that she would co-direct and co-write a second season of *Top of the Lake* with the story moved to Sydney and Harbour City, Hong Kong, and with Elisabeth Moss reprising her role as Robin Griffin.[25] The sequel series titled *Top of the Lake: China Girl* was released in 2017. Shot and set in Sydney, *Top of the Lake: China Girl* features Alice Englert, Campion's daughter, in a lead role as Robin's biological daughter. The series also features Ewen Leslie, David Dencik and Nicole Kidman.\n\n\nIn 2019, Campion's first film in a decade was announced, an adaptation of Thomas Savage's novel *The Power of the Dog*. The film was written and directed by her and was released in 2021,[26] having premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival, where Campion was awarded the Silver Lion for Best Direction.[27] The film was critically acclaimed internationally, winning numerous awards and nominations for the direction, screenplay, and performance of the cast of actors.[28] Campion earned three nominations in the respective categories for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture at the Golden Globe Awards, AACTA International Awards, Critics' Choice Movie Awards, and Satellite Awards. Campion issued an apology to Serena and Venus Williams following criticism of her acceptance speech for Critics Choice for Best Director, in which Campion said, \"And you know, Serena and Venus, you are such marvels. However, you do not play against the guys — like I have to.\" Her apology included, \"I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved,” she said. \"I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world-class athletes.\"[29] In February 2022, the film received 12 nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, leading that year's Oscar nominations.[30] The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Benedict Cumberbatch, Best Supporting Actress for Kirsten Dunst, and Best Supporting Actor for both Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons.[31] Campion became the first woman to receive multiple Best Director nominations, and she won Best Director for the film.[32] She is also the first woman to win Best Director without also winning a corresponding Best Picture.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Campion married Colin David Englert, an Australian who worked as a second unit director on *The Piano*.[33] Their first child, Jasper, was born in 1993 but lived for only 12 days.[34] Their second child, Alice Englert, was born in 1994; she is an actress. The couple divorced in 2001.[35]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nHer work, according to the critic bell hooks, \"seduces and excites audiences with its uncritical portrayal of sexism and misogyny. Reviewers and audiences alike seem to assume that Campion's gender, as well as her breaking of traditional boundaries that inhibit the advancement of women in film, indicate that her work expresses a feminist standpoint.\"[36] Accordingly, Campion's work has received praise from other critics. In V.W. Wexman's *Jane Campion: Interviews* (1999), critic David Thomson describes Campion \"as one of the best young directors in the world today.\"[37] In Sue Gillett's \"More Than Meets The Eye: The Mediation of Affects in Jane Campion's *Sweetie*\", Campion's work is described as \"perhaps the fullest and truest way of being faithful to the reality of experience\"; by utilizing the \"unsayable\" and \"unseeable\", she manages to catalyze audience speculation.[38] Campion's films tend to gravitate around themes of gender politics, such as seduction and female sexual power. This has led some to label Campion's body of work as feminist; however, Rebecca Flint Marx argues that \"while not inaccurate, [the feminist label] fails to fully capture the dilemmas of her characters and the depth of her work.\"[39]\n\n\n\n## Honours and accolades[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jane Campion receiving the Grand Jury Prize from Anjelica Huston at the 47th Venice International Film Festival\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Jane Campion\n\nCampion was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DNZM) in the 2016 New Year Honours, for services to film.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1986\n | *Two Friends* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Television film\n |\n| 1989\n | *Sweetie* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 1990\n | *An Angel at My Table* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  |\n| 1993\n | *The Piano* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 1996\n | *The Portrait of a Lady* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  |\n| 1999\n | *Holy Smoke!* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| *Soft Fruit* | No\n | No\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *In the Cut* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story* | No\n | No\n | Yes\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2009\n | *Bright Star* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 2021\n | *The Power of the Dog* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n\n\n### Short films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980\n | *Tissues* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 1981\n | *Mishaps of Seduction and Conquest* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 1982\n | *Peel: An Exercise in Discipline* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 1983\n | *Passionless Moments* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 1984\n | *A Girl's Own Story* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| *After Hours* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *The Water Diary* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Segment of *8* |\n| 2007\n | *The Lady Bug* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Segment of *To Each His Own Cinema* |\n| 2012\n | *I'm the One* | No\n | No\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 2016\n | *Family Happiness* | No\n | No\n | Yes\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013\n | *Top of the Lake* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Miniseries; co-directed with Garth Davis |\n| 2017\n | *Top of the Lake: China Girl* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Miniseries; co-directed with Ariel Kleiman |\n\n\n## Recurring collaborators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Work\nActor\n | 1986 | 1989 | 1990 | 1993 | 1996 | 1999 | 1999 | 2003 | 2009 | 2013 | 2017 | 2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Two Friends* (TV)\n | *Sweetie*\n | *An Angel at My Table*\n | *The Piano*\n | *The Portrait of a Lady*\n | *Holy Smoke*\n | *Soft Fruit*\n | *In the Cut*\n | *Bright Star*\n | *Top of the Lake* (S1)\n | *Top of the Lake* (S2)\n | *The Power of the Dog*\n |\n| Roger Ashton-Griffiths |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |\n| Kerry Fox |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |\n| Paul Goddard |  |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |\n| Holly Hunter |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |\n| Harvey Keitel |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Nicole Kidman |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  |\n| Genevieve Lemon |  | ![Yes](image) |  | ![Yes](image) |  | ![Yes](image) | ![Yes](image) |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  | ![Yes](image) |\n| Elisabeth Moss |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) | ![Yes](image) |  |\n| Kerry Walker |  |  |  | ![Yes](image) |  | ![Yes](image) |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)New Zealand portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Women's cinema\n* New Zealand film makers\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fox, Alistair (2011). *Jane Campion: Authorship and Personal Cinema*.

Earning four Academy Award nominations for the film, Zhao won Best Picture and Best Director, becoming the second woman and first woman of color to win the latter.[3][4][5] She also won awards for directing at the Directors Guild of America Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and British Academy Film Awards, becoming the second female winner of each of them.[6][7]\n\n\nZhao's latest film is the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film *Eternals* (2021), which she co-wrote and directed.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nZhao Ting (赵婷; *Zhào Tíng*) was born on 31 March 1982 in Beijing. Her father Zhao Yuji (赵玉吉; *Zhào Yùjí*) was an executive at Shougang Group, one of the country's largest state-owned steel companies. After amassing significant personal wealth, he later moved on to real-estate development and equity investment.[9]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Vogue*, Zhao described herself as \"a rebellious teen, lazy at school\" who drew manga-influenced comics and wrote fan fiction. She loved films growing up, especially *Happy Together* by Wong Kar-wai.[10][11] From an early age, Zhao was drawn to influences from Western pop culture.[12] After her parents separated, her father married comic actress Song Dandan, whom Zhao had grown up watching on television.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Zhao was still learning English at the time, her parents sent her to Brighton College, a private boarding school in Brighton at the age of 15.[10][11] She later moved to Los Angeles, United States by herself, living in a Koreatown apartment in 2000, and attended Los Angeles High School.[13] She next attended Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, United States, where she majored in politics and minored in film studies, graduating in 2005.[14][15][16] Bartending and working odd jobs after graduating helped her realize that she enjoyed meeting people and hearing about their lives and histories, giving her the push to attend film school.[17] A *Vulture* article reported that \"Four years was enough to turn her off of politics...she found herself drawn more to people than to policy\".[18] Following up on her undergraduate film minor, she next joined the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television Graduate Film Program[19] at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.[20] While attending Tisch, Zhao studied under director Spike Lee.[21] She told *USA Today* that she appreciated Lee not sugarcoating anything, saying that \"he will just tell you as it is\", something that she claims she needed.[22] After enrolling in the Graduate Studies film program at NYU in 2010 she made her first short film *Daughters*.[18]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zhao in 2015\nChloé Zhao's first work is her 2009 short film *The Atlas Mountains*, the story about Helen Thomas who develops a brief yet passionate relationship with an immigrant worker who comes to fix her computer.[23] She also released a second short film titled *Daughters,* a film about a 14-year-old girl Maple, living in rural China, who is forced into an arranged marriage and takes a dangerous path trying to break free.[24] This short won First Place Student Live Action Short at the 2010 Palm Springs International Short Fest and Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Cinequest Film Festival.[25]\n\n\nIn 2015, Zhao directed her first feature, *Songs My Brothers Taught Me*. Shot on location at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, the film depicts the relationship between a Lakota Sioux brother and his younger sister. An already existing reservation, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation has approximately 2.1 million acres, around 46,855 members, and occupies the Oglala Lakota, Jackson, and Bennet counties.[26] In Zhao's film, the brother Johnny plans to leave home and move to Los Angeles with his girlfriend when he graduates high school, but struggles with the thought of leaving his sister Jashaun at home with their troubled mother who is grieving the loss of their father. Focusing on the real lives and struggles of the surrounding community, the film showcases the realness of people and problems they are faced with.[27] In a *Filmmaker* article, Zhao stated that her rebellious years in her childhood is what pushed her to leave China and study abroad, helping her connect to the plot of the film which focuses on a character struggling in this environment.[28] Half improvised, around 100 hours of footage was collected as Zhao worked with the real residents of the reservation to draw inspiration from their lives and personalities in order to help shape her story.[29] She was able to utilize the natural landscape around her in this film in order to create a place of revelation, where people can be closest to God.[30] Using wide and long shots, she created a documentary-like film that feels authentic, the desolate beauty of the Great Plains creating a story that depicts both freedom and hopelessness.[31] It premiered in 2015 as part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition at Sundance Film Festival.[32] It later played at Cannes Film Festival as part of the Director's Fortnight selection[33] and was nominated for Best First Feature at the 31st Independent Spirit Awards.[34]\n\n\nIn 2017, Zhao directed *The Rider*, a contemporary western drama, which follows a young cowboy's journey to self-discovery after a near-fatal accident ends his professional riding career.[35] The film was executive produced by her father, Yuji Zhao.[36] As with her first feature, Zhao engaged a cast of non-actors who lived at the filming location, in this case on a ranch.[37] Her inspiration came from Brady Jandreau—a cowboy she had met and befriended on the reservation where she shot her first film—who suffered a severe head injury when thrown from his horse during a rodeo competition.[38] Jandreau would star in the film, playing a fictionalized version of himself as Brady Blackburn.[38] According to an *Indiewire* article, this film discovers a new side of the Western theme, revolutionary because a Chinese immigrant changed the nation's \"oldest genre.\"[39] The article stated that the film became \"the type of film it is because of a man and a woman, because the two of us wanted to work together and understand where we were coming from.\"[39]\n\n\nThe film premiered at Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors' Fortnight selection and won the Art Cinema Award.[40] It earned her nominations for Best Feature and Best Director at the 33rd Independent Spirit Awards. At the same ceremony, Zhao became the inaugural winner of the Bonnie Award, named after Bonnie Tiburzi, which recognizes a mid-career female director.[41][42] The film was released on April 13, 2018, by Sony Pictures Classics and was critically acclaimed.[43] Peter Keough of *The Boston Globe* wrote: \"[The film] achieves what cinema is capable of at its best: It reproduces a world with such acuteness, fidelity, and empathy that it transcends the mundane and touches on the universal.\"[44]\n\n\nIn 2018, Zhao directed her third feature film, *Nomadland*, starring Frances McDormand.[45] The adaptation from Jessica Bruder's *Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century* was shot over four months traveling the American West in an RV with many actual nomadic workers.[46] Bruder's book revolved around characters that can be found in the film, such as Linda May, a 64-year-old living in her van and scrounging for jobs in order to buy land for a permanent home.[47] Other characters, such as Bob Wells, a nomad vlogger of the CheapRVliving YouTube channel and website and in charge of the annual nomad meet-up featured in the film, are real people that Bruder encountered when writing her book and Zhao included in her movie.[48] The film tells the story of a widow who lost everything in The Great Recession and decides to travel in her van across the American Midwest, beginning a journey of self-discovery. Star Frances McDormand and Zhao bonded quickly and inspired each other, and McDormand became a huge element of the filmmaking process and its success.[49] They met a day before the 2018 Independent Spirit Awards, where McDormand was nominated for Best Actress and Zhao received a $50,000 grant for women directors. During the event, they hinted at their future project together.[49] It premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim and won the Golden Lion award,[50] and subsequently played at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People's Choice Award.[51] The film was released on February 19, 2021, by Searchlight Pictures.[52] Zhao won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for *Nomadland*, making her the first woman of Asian descent honored,[53] and only the second woman to win a Golden Globe for directing since Barbra Streisand in 1984.[6] In April 2021, Zhao won the Academy Award for Best Director, becoming the second woman to do so (Kathryn Bigelow being the first). The film has not received a theatrical release in China, with speculation that it was due to her past comments on the nation, and news of her Best Director win at the Academy Awards was also censored.[54]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Marvel Studios hired her to direct *Eternals*, based on the comic book characters of the same name.[55] The film follows the events of the 2019 Marvel movie *Avengers: Endgame,* featuring a new team of superheroes that must reunite in order to fight an ancient enemy of the human race, the Deviants.[56] Zhao was heavily influenced by Ridley Scott's *Prometheus* (2012) and Nick Cassavetes' *The Notebook* (2004) in crafting the MCU film.[57] It was released on November 5, 2021. Zhao is both the director and one of the four writers of the film, the others being Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo.[58] *Eternals* received mixed reviews. *The New Yorker* stated that Zhao's style of directing dialogue scenes \"reveals the absurdity of the script,\" saying \"it might as well have been done via green screen, for the little tangibility and texture that it offers the characters and viewers alike.\"[59] The article also claimed that the film has reportedly been banned in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait due to the relationship between two male characters, Phastos and Ben.[60] In spite of negative reviews, it still made $161.7 million during its opening weekend and became No. 1 at the box office.[61]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2021, *Variety* reported that with \"34 awards season trophies for directing, 13 for screenplay and nine for editing, Chloe Zhao has surpassed Alexander Payne (*Sideways*) as the most awarded person in a single awards season in the modern era.\"[62][*needs update*] In 2021, she appeared on the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[63]\n\n\nIn 2023, Zhao served as an executive producer on *The Graduates* directed by Hannah Peterson.[64]\n\n\n\n### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that Amazon Studios greenlit Zhao's untitled Bass Reeves biopic, a historical Western about the first black U.S. Deputy Marshal. Zhao is set to direct the film and write the screenplay.[65]\n\n\nIn February 2021, *Variety* confirmed that Zhao is tackling the classic Universal monster *Dracula*, as the writer, producer and director of a new take on the character in the vein of a futuristic sci-fi western.[66]\n\n\nIn August 2022, actor Patton Oswalt revealed that a sequel to *Eternals* was in development with Zhao returning to direct.[67][68] However, actor Kumail Nanjiani later stated that he had not heard anything about a sequel and believed that Oswalt was wrong.[69]\n\n\nA film adaptation of *Hamnet* produced in part by Amblin Partners and directed by Zhao was announced in April 2023, with Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal in talks to star in the film.[70]\n\n\n\n## Styles and themes[edit]\n\n\nThroughout her filmography, Zhao carries relatively the same styles and techniques. The main actress in her film *Nomadland*, Frances McDormand, told *Rolling Stone* about Zhao's process, saying \"she's basically like a journalist... she gets to know your story, and she creates a character from that\" and that she \"draws a razor-sharp line between sentiment and sentimentality\".[71] A Filmmaker Magazine article quoted Zhao saying \"I want to find new ways to place the camera to evoke more of a feeling. My goal is to put the camera inside of [the character]\".[28] An example of her process can be found in her newest film, *Eternals,* when she saw the connection between actors Lauren Ridloff and Barry Keoghan who play Makkari and Druig in the film.[72] The article said Zhao saw them interacting and thought \"Okay, we've got to write more moments\", stating \"It's the same as I did with *Nomadland* and *The Rider*. I would see how they interact and I would write that into the film\".[72] She believes that everyone wants to feel a connection, that filmmakers tell their stories because they don't want to feel alone, which is why she focuses on the themes of authenticity and places an emphasis on real stories.[73] In an interview with Brut America, Zhao touched upon her feeling on the importance of directing from the perspective of the female gaze. \"For me, there is a yin and yang in all of us, feminine and masculine strength and I think often in our society in our industry, the masculine strength is being celebrated, and that's a painful way to exist both for women and men.\"[74] Zhao, known primarily for her feature films which depict the lives and struggles of real people from diverse backgrounds, such as, The Rider, Songs My Brother Taught Me, and Nomadland, is now taking on projects that depict various characters from broader universes, for instance the Marvel film, Eternals. On directing this myriad of characters from the female perspective she says, \"I always try to find a way to give them a chance to be in touch with their feminine side\" \"We must also allow our male characters to access their softer side, I think that's the true female gaze.\"\n\n\n\n## Influences[edit]\n\n\nZhao cites Wong Kar-wai's romance *Happy Together* as the \"film that made me want to make films\". She was also influenced by Spike Lee, who was her film professor while she studied at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.[75][76] She cited Ang Lee as an influence as well, saying, \"Ang Lee's career has been very inspiring to me — how he's able to bring where he comes from to all the films that he makes\". She also has mentioned Werner Herzog and Terrence Malick as key influences.[77][78]\n\n\nZhao stated her earliest introductions to American cinema were *The Terminator*, *Ghost* and *Sister Act*.[75]\n\n\n\n## Censorship in China[edit]\n\n\nAfter Zhao became the second woman to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Director (for *Nomadland*), many Chinese viewers, as well as state media in China, celebrated her win and \"sought to claim Zhao's glory for China\".[79] Shortly afterward, however, some Chinese internet users began to question Zhao's citizenship and debated \"whether it is appropriate to claim Zhao's victory as China's\", with *Variety* calling the claim \"a common move by state-backed outlets to drum up nationalism\".[79] Much of the controversy hinged around two sets of remarks: a 2013 *Filmmaker* magazine interview in which Zhao described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\",[80] and a late 2020 interview in which Zhao was mis-quoted as saying \"The US is now my country\" (she had actually said \"The US is not my country,\" and the error was corrected about two months later).[81][79][82] References to Zhao in Chinese media were censored following her Oscar win.[83][84]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nZhao now resides in the Topatopa Mountains in Ojai, California with her partner and cinematographer, Joshua James Richards.[9] [85] Richards and Zhao met while Zhao was researching for her first feature film *Songs My Brother Taught Me* and Richards was still a film student at NYU. He has been her cinematographer for her next two films and served as camera operator on Marvel's *Eternals.*[86] In an *Elle* article, Richards stated that Zhao was \"gnarly and extreme\", someone he wanted to find at film school.[18]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n**Short films**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Editor\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008\n | *Helen's First Date in Two Years* | No\n | No\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| *Post* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *The Atlas Mountains* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | [23] |\n| *Simple Pleasures* | No\n | No\n | Yes\n | No\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Daughters* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | [24] |\n| 2011\n | *Benachin* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | No\n |  |\n\n\n**Feature films**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Editor\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015\n | *Songs My Brothers Taught Me* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | [87] |\n| 2017\n | *The Rider* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |\n| 2020\n | *Nomadland* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |\n| 2021\n | *Eternals* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Chloé Zhao\n\nDaughters (2010) won First Place Student Live Action Short at the 2010 Palm Springs International Short Fest and Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Cinequest Film Festival.

The recipient of three Academy Awards, his filmography is characterised by emphasis on social and class themes, genre-mixing, black humor, and sudden tone shifts.[1]\n\n\nHe first became known to audiences and achieved a cult following with his directorial debut film, the black comedy *Barking Dogs Never Bite* (2000), before achieving both critical and commercial success with his subsequent films: the crime thriller *Memories of Murder* (2003), the monster film *The Host* (2006), the science fiction action film *Snowpiercer* (2013), which served as Bong's English language debut, and the near-universally acclaimed black comedy thriller *Parasite* (2019), all of which are among the highest-grossing films in South Korea, with *Parasite* also being the highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[2]\n\n\nAll of Bong's films have been South Korean productions, although both *Snowpiercer* and *Okja* (2017) are mostly in the English language. Two of his films have screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival*—Okja* in 2017 and *Parasite* in 2019; the latter earned the Palme d'Or, which was a first for a South Korean film.[3][4] *Parasite* also became the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award nominations, with Bong winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, making *Parasite* the first film in the award's history not in English to win Best Picture.[5][6] In 2017, Bong was included on Metacritic's list of the 25 best film directors of the 21st century.[7] In 2020, Bong was included in *Time*'s annual list of 100 Most Influential People[8] and Bloomberg 50.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBong Joon Ho was born in Daegu, South Korea and is the youngest of four children.[10] His father, Bong Sang-gyun, was a first-generation graphic designer, industrial designer, and professor of art at Yeungnam University and the head of the art department at the National Film Institute; his mother, Park So-young, was a full-time housewife.[10][11] His father retired from Seoul Institute of Technology as a professor of design in 2007 and died in 2017. Bong's maternal grandfather, Park Taewon, was an esteemed author during the Japanese colonial period, best known for his work *A Day in the Life of Kubo the Novelist* and his defection to North Korea in 1950.[10][12] His older brother, Bong Joon-soo, is an English professor at the Seoul National University; his older sister, Bong Ji-hee, teaches fashion styling at Anyang University.[11] Currently, Bong's son, Bong Hyo-Min, is also a film director.[13][14]\n\n\nWhile Bong was in elementary school, the family relocated to Seoul, taking up residence in Jamsil-dong by the Han River.[12] In 1988, Bong enrolled in Yonsei University, majoring in sociology.[10] College campuses such as Yonsei's were then hotbeds for the South Korean democracy movement; Bong was an active participant of student demonstrations, frequently subjected to tear gas early in his college years.[10][15] He served a two-year term in the military in accordance with South Korea's compulsory military service before returning to college in 1992.[10] Bong later co-founded a film club named \"Yellow Door\" with students from neighboring universities.[10] As a member of the club, Bong made his first films, including a stop motion short titled *Looking for Paradise* and 16 mm film short titled *Baeksaekin (White Man)*.[10] He graduated from Yonsei University in 1995.[10]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Bong completed a two-year program at the Korean Academy of Film Arts. While there, he made many 16 mm short films. His graduation films, *Incoherence* and *Memories in My Frame*, were invited to screen at the Hong Kong International Film Festival and Vancouver International Film Festival. Bong also collaborated on several works with his classmates, which included working as cinematographer on the highly acclaimed short *2001 Imagine* (1994), directed by his friend Jang Joon-hwan. Aside from cinematography, Bong was also a lighting technician on two shorts—*The Love of a Grape Seed* and *Sounds From Heaven and Earth*—in 1994.[1] Eventually, he suffered severe hardships for more than ten years while working on film production. In his early stages as a film director, Bong received a meager salary of US$1,900 per year (as 4,500,000 won, or US$3,800, every two years).[*citation needed*] It was hard for him to make a living and he barely made enough to buy rice, so he had to borrow rice from his university's alumni.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating, he spent the next five years contributing in various capacities to works by other directors. He received a partial screenplay credit on the anthology film *Seven Reasons Why Beer is Better Than a Lover* (1996); both screenplay and assistant director credits on Park Ki-yong's debut *Motel Cactus* (1997); and is one of four writers (along with Jang Joon-hwan) credited for the screenplay of *Phantom: The Submarine* (1999).[1]\n\n\n\n### Early directing work[edit]\n\n\nShortly afterwards, Bong began shooting his first feature *Barking Dogs Never Bite* (2000) under producer Cha Seung-jae, who had overseen the production of both *Motel Cactus* and *Phantom: The Submarine*.[16] The film, about a low-ranking university lecturer who abducts a neighbor's dog, was shot in the same apartment complex where Bong lived after his marriage.[17] At the time of its release in February 2000, it received little commercial interest but some positive critical reviews. It was invited to the competition section of Spain's San Sebastián International Film Festival, and won awards at the Slamdance Film Festival and Hong Kong International Film Festival. Slowly building international word of mouth also helped the film financially; over two years after its local release, the film reached its financial break-even point due to sales to overseas territories.[1][*better source needed*]\n\n\nBong's second film, *Memories of Murder* (2003), a much larger project, was adapted from a stage play centered on a real-life serial killer who terrorized a rural town in the 1980s and was never caught (although a suspect confessed to the crime in 2019).[18] Production of the film was a difficult process (the film set a local record for the number of locations it used).[*citation needed*] It was released in April 2003 and proved a critical and popular success. Word of mouth drove the film to sell over five million tickets (rescuing Cha Seung-jae's production company Sidus from near-bankruptcy), and a string of local honors followed, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Song Kang-Ho) and Best Lighting prizes at the Grand Bell Awards in 2003. Although passed over by the Cannes Film Festival and Venice Film Festival, the film eventually received its international premiere, again at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, where it picked up three awards including Best Director. The film also received an unusually strong critical reception on its release in foreign territories, such as France and the U.S.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bong at the 25th Independent Spirit Awards on March 5, 2010\nFollowing this, Bong took some time to contribute short films to two anthology film projects. *Influenza* (2004) is a 30-minute work acted out entirely in front of real CCTV cameras stationed throughout Seoul. The film, which charts a desperate man's turn to violent crime over the space of five years, was commissioned by the Jeonju International Film Festival, together with works by Japanese director Sogo Ishii and Hong Kong-based Yu Lik-wai. *Twentidentity*, meanwhile, is a 20-part anthology film made by alumni of the Korean Academy of Film Arts, on the occasion of the school's 20th anniversary. Bong's contribution is *Sink & Rise* (2003), a work set alongside the Han River.[1]\n\n\n\n### International success[edit]\n\n\n*The Host* (2006) marked a step up in scale in Bong's career, and indeed for the Korean film industry as a whole.[19] The big-budget ($12 million) work centered on a fictional monster that rises up out of the Han River to wreak havoc on the people of Seoul—and on one family in particular. Featuring many of the actors who had appeared in his previous films, the film was the focus of strong audience interest even before it started shooting, but there were many doubts raised about whether a Korean production could rise to the challenge of creating a full-fledged, believable digital monster.[19] After initially contacting New Zealand's Weta Digital—the company responsible for the CGI in *The Lord of the Rings*—scheduling conflicts led Bong to San Francisco-based The Orphanage, who took on the majority of the effects work. After rushing to meet deadlines, the film received a rapturous premiere in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Although local audiences were slightly more critical of *The Host* than attendees at Cannes, the film was nonetheless a major summer hit. With theater owners calling for more and more prints, the film enjoyed South Korea's widest release ever (on over a third of the nation's 1,800 screens) and set a new box office record with 13 million tickets sold. *The Host* was quickly sold around the world, and US studio Universal bought the remake rights.[1][20]\n\n\nBong, along with French film directors Michel Gondry and Leos Carax, directed a segment of *Tokyo!* (2008), a triptych feature telling three separate tales of the city. Bong's segment is about a man who has lived for a decade as a *Hikikomori*—the term used in Japan for people unable to adjust to society who do not leave their homes—and what happens when he falls in love with a pizza delivery girl.[21]\n\n\nBong's fourth feature film *Mother* (2009) is the story of a doting mother who struggles to save her disabled son from a murder accusation. It premiered in the *Un Certain Regard* section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival to much acclaim, particularly for actress Kim Hye-ja; she went on to win the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress.[22] *Mother* repeated its critical success locally and in the international film festival circuit. The film appeared on many film critics' \"best-of\" lists of 2010.[23]\n\n\nIn 2011, Bong contributed to *3.11 A Sense of Home*, another anthology film, each segment being 3 minutes and 11 seconds in duration, addressing the theme of home. The films were made by 21 filmmakers in response to the devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit the Tohoku region of Japan on March 11, 2011. The film screened on the first anniversary of the disaster.[24] In Bong's short film *Iki*, a teenage girl finds a toddler, seemingly dead, on a beach.[25]\n\n\nThat same year, Bong served as a jury member for the 27th Sundance Film Festival.[26][27] He was also the head of the jury for the Caméra d'Or section of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival[28][29] and 2013 Edinburgh International Film Festival.[30]\n\n\n\n### American co-productions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bong at the 2013 Deauville American Film Festival\nBong's first English-language film, *Snowpiercer*, was released in 2013. It is based on the graphic novel *Le Transperceneige* (1982) by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette,[31][32][33][34][35] and set largely on a futuristic train where those on board are separated according to their social status. The film premiered at Times Square on July 29, 2013, in Seoul, South Korea,[36] before screening at the Deauville American Film Festival as the closing film on September 7, 2013,[37] the Berlin International Film Festival as part of Berlin's Forum Sidebar on February 7, 2014,[38] opening the LA Film Festival on June 11, 2014,[39] and the Edinburgh International Film Festival on June 22, 2014.[40] Upon release in cinemas, *Snowpiercer* was met with near-universal praise and strong ticket sales,[41] both in South Korea and abroad. On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 253 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"*Snowpiercer* offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacular for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters.\"[42] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[43] As of April 2014, it is the tenth highest-grossing domestic film in South Korea, with 9,350,141 admissions. The film also holds the domestic record for the fastest movie (domestic and foreign) to reach four million admissions, which it achieved in its fifth day after the premiere, and another record for the highest weekend figure (from Friday to Sunday) for a Korean film, with 2.26 million viewers.[44] In addition to receiving several awards and nominations, *Snowpiercer* appeared on several critics' lists of the ten best films of 2014.[45]\n\n\nIn 2015, Bong's next film, *Okja*, was announced.[46] On April 30, 2015, screenwriter Jon Ronson announced on his Twitter account that he was writing the second draft of Bong's screenplay for the film.[47] Darius Khondji joined the film as cinematographer in February 2016.[48] Filming for the project began in April 2016.[49] It premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or and sparked controversy due to it being produced by Netflix.[50] The film was met with boos, mixed with applause, during a press screening at the film festival, once the Netflix logo appeared on screen and again during a technical glitch; the film was projected in the incorrect aspect ratio for its first seven minutes.[51][52][53] The festival later issued an apology to the filmmakers.[54] However, despite the studio's negative response, the film itself received a four-minute standing ovation following its actual premiere.[55] The film was later released on Netflix on June 28, 2017, and received positive reviews.[56] On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 235 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.54/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"*Okja* sees Bong Joon Ho continuing to create defiantly eclectic entertainment – and still hitting more than enough of his narrative targets in the midst of a tricky tonal juggling act.\"[57] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[58] *New York Times* critic A. O. Scott wrote: \"*Okja* is a miracle of imagination and technique, and *Okja* insists, with abundant mischief and absolute sincerity, that she possesses a soul.\"[59]\n\n\n\n### *Parasite* (2019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bong Joon-ho at the Munich International Film Festival in July 2019\nIn 2019, Bong directed the South Korean film *Parasite*,[60] a black comedy thriller about a poor family that infiltrates a wealthy household by gaining employment as staff. The film premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or, becoming the first Korean film to receive the award and the first film to do so with a unanimous vote since *Blue Is the Warmest Colour* at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.[61] On June 16, 2019, the film won the $60,000 Sydney Film Prize at the Sydney Film Festival[62][63] where it was in competition alongside eleven other features from countries such as North Macedonia, Brazil and Spain, and Australian entrants Mirrah Foulkes (for *Judy and Punch*) and Ben Lawrence (for *Hearts and Bones*).[64]\n\n\n*Parasite* was released in South Korea by CJ Entertainment on May 30, 2019, and in the United States by Neon on October 11, 2019. It received unanimous critical acclaim and earned $266 million at the worldwide box office, becoming Bong's highest-grossing release.[65] On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 99% based on 451 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.37/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"An urgent, brilliantly layered look at timely social themes, *Parasite* finds writer-director Bong Joon Ho in near-total command of his craft.\"[66] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 96 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[67] Regarding motivation of the film's creation, Bong hoped that he would live a comfortable life, however he was disappointed several times in reality. He wanted to express the anxiety, sadness, and deep fear that came from reality of life via his film.[13][14]\n\n\nThroughout the 2019–2020 film awards season, Bong and the film received numerous accolades. Bong received the Hollywood Filmmaker Award at the 23rd Hollywood Film Awards[68] and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director (tied with Sam Mendes for *1917*) at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards.[69][70] He was also nominated[71] for Best Director and Best Screenplay (shared with Han Jin-won) at the 77th Golden Globe Awards,[72] with the film itself winning Best Foreign Language Film.[73] This was the first Golden Globe Award nomination (and win) for any South Korean film.[74] *Parasite* also became the first non-English-language film to win the top prize at the 70th American Cinema Editors Eddie Awards when film editor Yang Jin-mo won Best Edited Feature Film – Dramatic.[75][76] At the 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast of *Parasite* won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, making history as the first foreign-language film to win in the category.[77] At the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, *Parasite* was nominated in four categories,[78] winning two awards—Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Not in the English Language.[79]\n\n\n*Parasite* was later submitted as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film for the 92nd Academy Awards,[80] making the December shortlist.[81] It eventually became the first South Korean film to receive an Academy Award nomination in any category, receiving a total of six nominations and winning four awards—Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. This was also the first time a non-English language film won the Academy Award[82][2] for Best Picture[83] and the first time Asian writers won Academy Awards for screenwriting.[84][85] While accepting the Academy Award for Best Director, Bong expressed his deep respect and appreciation for fellow nominees Martin Scorsese, who inspired his work, and Quentin Tarantino, who supported and praised his earlier films.[86] He also mentioned a quote from Scorsese—\"The most personal is the most creative\"—that also inspired him, which prompted the audience to give Scorsese an enthusiastic standing ovation.[87] Scorsese later wrote and sent a heartfelt letter to Bong after *Parasite*'s Oscar success.[88] *Parasite*'s Best Picture win was well received by film critics, who hailed it as a major step forward for popular appreciation of international film and for restoring the legitimacy of the Academy. \"The academy gave best picture to the actual best picture\", wrote Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times*, who continued that the film awards body was \"startled ... into recognizing that no country's cinema has a monopoly on greatness\".[89] Conversely, U.S. president Donald Trump lambasted *Parasite*'s win at a campaign rally in Colorado on February 20, 2020, questioning why a foreign film won Best Picture;[90] his comments were widely condemned as \"xenophobic\" and \"racist\".[91] Distribution company Neon responded by tweeting: \"Understandable, he can't read.\"[92]\n\n\nIn January 2020, an HBO six-hour limited series based on the film, with Bong and Adam McKay serving as executive producers, currently in early development, was announced as an upcoming project.[93] Bong has stated that the series, also titled *Parasite*, will explore stories \"that happen in between the sequences in the film\".[94][95] In February 2020, Mark Ruffalo was rumored to star while Tilda Swinton was confirmed to being cast as the female lead.[96][97][98] In September 2021, Bong served as jury president of the 78th Venice International Film Festival.[99]\n\n\n\n### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Bong said that he had been working on two scripts after completing *Parasite*, one in English and one in Korean, and that he had finished one of the two. He said that the Korean film \"is located in Seoul and has unique elements of horror and action\" and that the English film is \"a drama film based on a true event that happened in 2016.\"[100]\n\n\nBong is preparing for a Korean animation as one of his next films. This animation was conceived since 2018 and said it is a Korean project that is a drama genre involving deep-sea creatures and humans.[101]\n\n\nIn January 2022, it was revealed Bong's next film would be *Mickey 17*, an adaptation of Edward Ashton's novel *Mickey7*. Bong was given an advance manuscript of the novel in late 2021. The film, which was written, co-produced and directed by Bong, will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and will star Robert Pattinson, Bong's first collaborations with both.[102] In May 2022, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette, and Mark Ruffalo joined the cast and the film is entered in pre-production at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden.[103][104] In July 2022, Steven Yeun joined the cast. Production commenced on August 1, 2022.[105][106]\n\n\n\n## Inspirations and style[edit]\n\n\nAs a child, Bong watched *Black Orpheus* (1959), which made a big impact on him, on Korean television. While he was in film school, Bong watched the *Qatsi* trilogy (1982–2002).[107] His main inspirations are from Guillermo del Toro—his favorite films of del Toro's are *The Devil's Backbone* (2001) and *Pan's Labyrinth* (2006)—and Nagisa Ōshima, describing Oshima as \"one of the most controversial masters\".[107] Bong also studied the films of Martin Scorsese and cited him as one of his major influences during his acceptance speech for the Academy Award for Best Director when he won for *Parasite* (2019).[108] His process when working with actors is to make them feel comfortable and gives them a high amount of freedom when performing, even allowing them to improvise. Bong has commented that he doesn't like the term 'Directing Actors' as he feels that \"acting is the actor's job and it's something I don't feel like I can direct\".\n\n\nThe most defining trademark of Bong's films are their sudden tone shifts (sometimes within scenes) between drama, darkness, and black or slapstick humor. During a TIFF Master Class at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, Bong claimed: \"I'm never really conscious of the tone shifts or the comedy that I apply, I never think 'oh, the tone shifts at this point or it's funny at this point.' I'm never conscious of it during the filmmaking or screenwriting process.\"[109] Bong also uses real filming locations or specially built sets in all his films as opposed to green screens, even to the extent of filming in Seoul's sewers for *The Host* (2006); *Memories of Murder* (2003) set a local record for the number of locations it used.\n\n\nIn an interview promoting *Snowpiercer* (2013), actor Ed Harris described Bong's shooting process as \"cutting while filming\". Harris also said that \"if I was doing a scene and it was a couple of pages long, he would never shoot the whole thing one way. He'd shoot a few lines, like the first beat of the scene, and then he would turn the camera around and get my part for that part of the scene. Then he would change the angle a little bit\". He additionally noted that \"the editor was sitting right there on the stage, right below the set with a big tent, actually getting the footage as they were filming.[110] Fellow actor Daniel Henshall echoed Harris' sentiment calling Bong \"precise\" and \"very sure of what he wants\". Henshall continued by saying: \"He only shoots what he's going to use in the edit. Doesn't do any coverage. I've never worked like that before. You're trimming the fat before you've shot it, which is very brave, because when you get into the edit, if something's missing you haven't got it.

He is known for directing films in a variety of genres, including the family drama *A Little Princess* (1995), the romantic drama *Great Expectations* (1998), the coming of age road film *Y tu mamá también* (2001), the fantasy film *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* (2004), science fiction films such as *Children of Men* (2006) and *Gravity* (2013) and the semi-autobiographical drama *Roma* (2018).\n\n\nCuarón has received 11 Academy Award nominations, winning four: Best Director for *Gravity* and *Roma*, Best Film Editing for *Gravity*, and Best Cinematography for *Roma*. He is the first Mexican filmmaker to win the Best Director award,[2] and the second person to have been nominated for an Academy Award in seven different categories after Kenneth Branagh.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCuarón was born in Mexico City, the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a doctor specializing in nuclear medicine, and Cristina Orozco, a pharmaceutical biochemist.[3] He has a sister Christina, and two brothers; Carlos, also a filmmaker,[4] and Alfredo, a conservation biologist.[5] Cuarón studied philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and filmmaking at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos,[6] a school within the same university. There he met the director Carlos Marcovich and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki,[6] and they made what would be his first short film, *Vengeance Is Mine*.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several film productions including *La Gran Fiesta*, *Gaby: A True Story* and *Romero*, and in 1991 he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.\n\n\nIn 1991, Cuarón directed *Sólo con tu pareja*, a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by Daniel Giménez Cacho) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted AIDS. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán.[8] The film, which also starred cabaret singer Astrid Hadad and model/actress Claudia Ramírez (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993) was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director Sydney Pollack hired Cuarón to direct an episode of *Fallen Angels*, a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included Steven Soderbergh, Jonathan Kaplan, Peter Bogdanovich, and Tom Hanks.\n\n\nIn 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, *A Little Princess*, an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of Charles Dickens's *Great Expectations* starring Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Robert De Niro.\n\n\n\n### 2000s: International success[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cuarón and Clive Owen, who worked together on *Children of Men*.\nIn 2001, Cuarón found himself returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film *Y tu mamá también*, starring Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna and Maribel Verdú. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman who is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother Carlos Cuarón.\n\n\nIn 2004, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful *Harry Potter* series, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. Cuarón faced criticism at the time from some *Harry Potter* fans for his approach to the film, notably its tendency to take more creative liberties with the source material than its predecessors. However, author J. K. Rowling, who had seen and loved Cuarón's film *Y tu mamá también*, said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.[9] Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking its new tone and for being the first *Harry Potter* film to truly capture the essence of the novels.[10] It has been subsequently rated by audience polls and critics as the best of the movie franchise series.\n\n\nIn 2006, Cuarón's feature *Children of Men*, an adaptation of the P. D. James novel starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine, received wide critical acclaim including three Academy Award nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film, in Best Film Editing (with Alex Rodríguez) and Best Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).\n\n\nHe created the production and distribution company Esperanto Filmoj (\"Esperanto Films\", named because of his support for the international language Esperanto[11]), which has credits in the films *Duck Season*, *Pan's Labyrinth*, and *Gravity*.\n\n\nCuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement *I Am Autism* for Autism Speaks that was criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.[12]\n\n\n\n### 2010s: Awards success[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cuaron at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival\nIn 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film *Gravity*, a drama set in space. He was joined by producer David Heyman, with whom Cuarón worked on *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. Starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the film opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August.

They began their career as directors of music videos,[3] including ones for \"Houdini\" (2012) by Foster the People and \"Turn Down for What\" (2013) by DJ Snake and Lil Jon, both of which earned them nominations at the Grammy Awards.\n\n\nThey have since ventured into film, having written and directed the absurdist comedy-dramas *Swiss Army Man* (2016) and *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022). The latter became the independent production company A24's highest-grossing release,[4] and won the duo many awards, including three Academy Awards: for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Careers[edit]\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\nKwan and Scheinert met while they were both studying film at Emerson College in Boston.[8] Kwan graduated in 2010 and Scheinert graduated in 2009.[9] They went to college with Sunita Mani, who starred with Kwan in the music video for \"Turn Down for What\",[10] which they directed.[11]\n\n\nSince 2011, the duo have directed music videos for artists including Foster the People, The Shins and Tenacious D. In 2018, Kwan co-founded the group We Direct Music Videos (W.D.M.V.), described as \"a global community of music video directors who are committed to sustainable directorial labor practices\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Transition to film and television[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, the duo expanded to feature films, writing and directing *Swiss Army Man*, starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe,[13] which received positive reviews,[14] as well as the duo winning the Directing Award at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.[15] In 2019, Scheinert directed the black comedy-drama film *The Death of Dick Long*, which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and received positive reviews.\n\n\nThe Daniels have since accumulated several television directing credits, including *Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens, Legion* (Kwan only) *and On Becoming a God in Central Florida* (Scheinert only). The duo were attached as directors on a prospective TV adaption of *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut, being developed by Noah Hawley, but the project was not picked up.[16]\n\n\n\n### *Everything Everywhere All at Once*[edit]\n\n\nThe Daniels announced in 2017 they would write, direct, and produce a science-fiction film with their producing partner Jonathan Wang and the Russo brothers.[17][18] *Everything Everywhere All at Once,* starring Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis, was released in March 2022 to widespread critical acclaim and box office success, garnering several awards and accolades for the duo including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Director at the 95th Academy Awards.[19] The film received 11 Academy Award nominations, more than any other film that year, and won seven. Prior to the Oscars ceremony, IGN calculated that *Everything Everywhere All at Once* had surpassed *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) as the most awarded film of all time.[20]\n\n\n\n### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the Daniels have signed a first look TV deal with A24.[21] The same year, they also signed a five-year film deal with Universal Pictures.[22]\n\n\nThe duo were on the *Time* 100 Next list in 2022.[23]\n\n\nIn March 2023, it was revealed that the Daniels had directed one episode of *Star Wars: Skeleton Crew* (2024).[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Personal lives[edit]\n\n\nKwan was born in Westborough, Massachusetts, to a Taiwanese mother and a father from Hong Kong. He is married to fellow filmmaker and animator Kirsten Lepore since 2016, and together they have one son.[26][27] Kwan was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after researching the condition for *Everything Everywhere All At Once*.[28]\n\n\nScheinert was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of Becky and Ken Scheinert.[29][30] He attended Oak Mountain Elementary and Middle School, and was a student at the advanced magnet program Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School at the campus of Shades Valley High School.[29]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Short films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | *Swingers* | Yes\n | Yes\n | [10] |\n| 2010\n | *Puppets* | Yes\n | Yes\n | [10] |\n| 2011\n | *My Best Friend's Wedding/My Best Friend's Sweating* | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *Possibilia* | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *Interesting Ball* | Yes\n | Yes\n |  |\n\n\n**Scheinert only**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007\n | *I'm Nostalgic* | Yes\n | No\n |\n| 2008\n | *Trust* | Yes\n | Yes\n |\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\n | *Swiss Army Man* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |\n| 2022\n | *Everything Everywhere All at Once* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |\n\n\n### Feature films (segments only)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020\n | *Omniboat: A Fast Boat Fantasia* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |\n\n\n**Scheinert only**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Producer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | *The Death of Dick Long* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also portrayed Dick Long;Also performed \"It's Been A While\"\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Episode\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013\n | *NTSF:SD:SUV::* | \"Comic Con Air\"\n |\n| \"Wreck the Malls\"\n |\n| *Childrens Hospital* | \"Coming and Going\"\n |\n| *Infomercials* | \"Broomshakalaka!\"\n |\n| 2020\n | *Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens* | \"Grandma & Chill\"\n |\n| 2023\n | *Star Wars: Skeleton Crew* | Post-production\n |\n\n\n**Kwan only**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Episode\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | *Legion* | \"Chapter 23\"\n |\n\n\n**Scheinert only**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Episode\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | *Right Now Kapow* | \"Radical Mutants/My Fair Peasant\"\n |\n| 2019\n | *On Becoming a God in Central Florida* | \"Many Masters\"\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Artist\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | \"Underwear\"\n | FM Belfast | [31] |\n| \"Pigeons\"\n | The Hundred in the Hands |  |\n| \"Commotion\"\n |  |\n| 2011\n | \"Simple Math\"\n | Manchester Orchestra |  |\n| \"Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)\"\n | Foster the People | [10] |\n| \"When the Night Falls\"\n | Chromeo (featuring Solange Knowles)\n |  |\n| 2012\n | \"My Machines\"\n | Battles |  |\n| \"Simple Song\"\n | The Shins | [10] |\n| \"Houdini\"\n | Foster the People\n | [10] |\n| \"Rize of the Fenix\"\n | Tenacious D | [10] |\n| 2013\n | \"Cry Like a Ghost\"\n | Passion Pit |  |\n| 2014\n | \"Turn Down for What\"\n | DJ Snake and Lil Jon | [10] |\n| \"Tongues\"\n | Joywave |  |\n| 2017\n | \"The Sunshine\"\n | Manchester Orchestra\n |  |\n| \"The Alien\"[32] |  |\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Work\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013 | Grammy Awards | Best Short Form Music Video | \"Houdini\" | Nominated\n | [33] |\n| 2015 | Best Music Video | \"Turn Down for What\"\n | Nominated\n | [34] |\n| 2016\n | Gotham Independent Film Awards | Breakthrough Director | *Swiss Army Man* | Nominated\n | [35] |\n|  | Sundance Film Festival | Directing Award Dramatic | Won\n | [36][37][38][39] |\n| 2017\n | Independent Spirit Awards | Best First Feature | Nominated\n | [40] |\n| 2022\n | Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards | Best Picture\n | *Everything Everywhere All at Once* | Won\n | [41] |\n| Best Director\n | Won\n |\n| Best Screenplay\n | Won\n |\n| Best Indie Film\n | Won\n |\n| Saturn Awards | Best Fantasy Film | Won\n | [42][43] |\n| Best Writing | Nominated\n |\n| Gotham Independent Film Awards | Best Feature | Won\n | [44] |\n| British Independent Film Awards | Best InternationalIndependent Film | Nominated\n | [45] |\n| National Board of Review Awards | Top Ten Films | Won\n | [46] |\n| American Film Institute Awards | Top 10 Films of the Year\n | Won\n | [47] |\n| New York Film Critics Online Awards | Best Director\n | Won\n | [48] |\n| Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards | Best Film | Won\n | [49] |\n| Washington D.C.

I generally avoid hyperbole, unless it's a joke, but this really was one of the best weekends of my life.

The film also stars Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., and James Hong in supporting roles.\n\n\nKwan and Scheinert began work on the project in 2010. Production was announced in 2018, and principal photography ran from January to March 2020. The filmmakers initially sought Jackie Chan for the lead role before the script was revised to feature a female protagonist as part of a wife-husband duo.[8] The works of Hong Kong film director Wong Kar-wai, as well as the children's book *Sylvester and the Magic Pebble* and the video game *Everything,* served as inspiration for several scenes. The soundtrack features compositions by Son Lux, including collaborations with Mitski, David Byrne, André 3000, John Hampson, and Randy Newman. The film explores philosophical themes such as existentialism, nihilism, surrealism, and absurdism, as well as themes such as neurodivergence, depression, generational trauma, and Asian American identity.\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2022, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 25, 2022, before a wide release by A24 on April 8. The film grossed over $141 million worldwide, becoming A24's highest-grossing film. It garnered widespread critical acclaim and was a success at the 95th Academy Awards, winning a leading seven awards out of eleven nominations: Best Picture, Best Actress for Yeoh, Best Supporting Actor for Quan, Best Supporting Actress for Curtis, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Kwan and Scheinert, and Best Film Editing.[9][10][11][12] It also won two Golden Globe Awards, five Critics' Choice Awards (including Best Picture), a BAFTA Award, a record four SAG Awards (including Best Ensemble), a record seven Independent Spirit Awards (including Best Feature),[13][14] and swept the four major guild awards (DGA, PGA, SAG, and WGA).[15] With 266 awards out of 405 nominations, *Everything Everywhere All at Once* is currently estimated to be the most awarded film of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nEvelyn Quan Wang is a middle-aged Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond; two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy. In the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage, Evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as *Gong Gong*, Cantonese for \"grandfather\"[16]) is visiting for her Chinese New Year party, and Joy is dealing with depression[17] and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes Evelyn's reluctance to accept Joy's lesbian relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky.\n\n\nAt a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the \"Alphaverse.\" Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. In the Alphaverse, the late Alpha-Evelyn developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki (Alpha-Joy), whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to verse-jump beyond her endurance; Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. She has created a black hole-like \"Everything Bagel\" topped with *everything*,[18] which appears as a toroid singularity[19] that could destroy the multiverse.\n\n\nEvelyn is given verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu's minions, who converge on the IRS building. She discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of Waymond's plans with the divorce papers. Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu from using her to enter Evelyn's universe. Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe, Evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses.\n\n\nEvelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the Evelyns that do not agree with her. She brings Evelyn to the Everything Bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the Bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and behaves cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her.\n\n\nAs Evelyn is about to enter the Bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. Evelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond's absurdist[20] and humanist[21] advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy[22] and bring happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and tells Gong Gong of it, and talks with Deirdre after Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes. Jobu decides to enter the Bagel alone while, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy begs Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the Bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace.\n\n\nSome time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n(Clockwise) *Everything Everywhere All at Once* stars Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu, Jamie Lee Curtis, and James Hong\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Quan Wang, a dissatisfied and overwhelmed laundromat owner; and as several other versions of Evelyn in alternate universes.\n* Stephanie Hsu as Joy Wang, Evelyn's daughter; and Jobu Tupaki, Alpha-Evelyn's omnicidal daughter whose growing nihilism is a threat to the entire multiverse.\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang, Evelyn's meek and goofy husband whose humanist existentialism is the antidote to Jobu's nihilism; and as Alpha-Waymond, from the Alphaverse; and other versions of Waymond in alternate universes.\n* Jenny Slate as Debbie the Dog Mom, a laundromat customer. Her original name of Big Nose was changed for the film's digital release because of its association with Jewish stereotypes.[23]\n* James Hong as Gong Gong (Cantonese for \"grandfather\"[16]), Evelyn's demanding father; and Alpha-Gong Gong, Alpha-Evelyn's father in the Alphaverse who wants Evelyn to sacrifice Joy to impede Jobu.\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre, an IRS inspector; and as other versions of Deirdre in alternate universes.\n\n\nTallie Medel appears as Becky Sregor, Joy's girlfriend; Biff Wiff appears as Rick, a laundromat customer; Sunita Mani and Aaron Lazar appear as actors in a musical film Evelyn watches; Audrey Wasilewski and Peter Banifaz appear as Alpha RV Officers; Andy Le and Brian Le appear as Alpha Trophy Jumpers; Li Jing appears as Evelyn's kung-fu teacher,[24] and Michiko Nishiwaki appears as Evelyn's kung-fu opponent and co-star. Harry Shum Jr. plays Chad, a *teppanyaki* chef working alongside an alternative Evelyn in another universe.\n\n\nRandy Newman, who has scored nine Disney–Pixar films, appears as the voice of Raccacoonie, a reference to the Pixar-animated film *Ratatouille* (2007); he is credited as a featured artist on the soundtrack \"Now We're Cookin'\".[25] Cameos include Scheinert as District Manager, and Kwan uncredited as a man sucked into the bagel and as a mugger.[26]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Writer-directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan\nCo-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known as the Daniels, began researching the concept of the multiverse as early as 2010, after being exposed to the concept of modal realism in the Ross McElwee documentary *Sherman's March* (1986).[19] Kwan described the release of the animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), which also deals with a multiversal concept, as \"a little upsetting because we were like, 'Oh shit, everyone's going to beat us to this thing we've been working on.'\"[19] He also stated \"Watching the second season of *Rick and Morty* (2013-present) was really painful. I was like, 'They've already done all the ideas we thought were original!' It was a really frustrating experience. So I stopped watching *Rick and Morty* while we were writing this project\".[19]\n\n\nIn early drafts of the screenplay, the directors planned for the main character to be a professor and have undiagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); through his research for the project, Kwan learned that he had undiagnosed ADHD.[27]\n\n\nScenes in which Evelyn trains in martial arts and becomes an action film star were visually and contextually inspired by the films of Wong Kar-wai. Chris Lee of *Vulture* writes that they \"conjur[e] a mood of exquisite romantic yearning that will be instantly recognizable ... as touchstones\" of Wong's works. The universe in which Evelyn and Joy are rocks was influenced by the children's book *Sylvester and the Magic Pebble* (1969) and the video game *Everything* (2017).[19]\n\n\nKwan has said the idea of the everything bagel \"started as just a throwaway joke\", a play on a type of American bagel called an \"everything bagel\", which is baked with a large variety of toppings. Scheinert said they spent time attempting to develop the religion of bagel followers, but encountered complications: \"Jobu Tupaki's a nihilist; should there be dogma? Should there be a book? What should their practices be as a religion? The bagel stuck because it became such a useful, simple symbol that we could point to as filmmakers. And you don't have to explain it much beyond the joke.\"[19][18]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ke Huy Quan, pictured in 2018, retired from acting in 2002 and returned shortly before being cast in this film.\nThe script was written for Jackie Chan until Kwan and Scheinert reconceived the protagonist as a woman, feeling it would make the husband–wife dynamic in the story more relatable.[28]\n\n\nThe new script's lead character was initially named Michelle Wang, after the film's lead actress Michelle Yeoh, who said, \"If you ask the Daniels, when they started on this draft, they focused on, 'Well, we are doing this for Michelle Yeoh.'\"[29] The character's name was eventually changed to Evelyn. With her resemblance to the version of Evelyn as a martial artist and film star,[30] Yeoh opposed naming the character Michelle. \"Evelyn deserves her own story to be told. This is a very ordinary mother [and] housewife who is trying her best to be a good mother to her daughter, a good daughter to her father, a wife that's trying to keep the family together [...] I don't like to integrate me, Michelle Yeoh, into the characters that I play, because they all deserve their own journey and their stories to be told\".[30]\n\n\nIt was announced in August 2018 that Yeoh and Awkwafina had been cast to star in what was described as an \"interdimensional action film\" from Kwan and Scheinert, with Anthony and Joe Russo attached to produce.[31] Awkwafina left the project in January 2020 due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced with Stephanie Hsu. James Hong, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis joined the cast. It marked Quan's return to film acting, from which he had retired after *Second Time Around* (2002) due to a lack of casting opportunities.[32][33] Kwan and Scheinert were inspired to cast Quan after seeing a meme of former New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang being shown as a grown-up version of Short Round, Quan's character from *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* (1984). They were curious to learn what Quan had been doing, and learned that he was the right age to portray Waymond. Coincidentally, Quan had returned to acting, inspired by the success of *Crazy Rich Asians* (2018), soon before he was approached for the role.[34] This is a result of a domino effect where the director Jon M. Chu was inspired to create *Crazy Rich Asians* because of #StarringJohnCho, a movement about Asian representation in leading roles in Hollywood.[35] Jeff Cohen, Quan's former co-star from *The Goonies* (1985), was his attorney to negotiate his contract.[36]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in January 2020, with A24 announcing that it would finance and distribute the film.[33] Around this time, Kwan and Schneirt were invited by Marvel Studios to discuss the possibility of them developing the first season of the Disney+ series *Loki*, which also deals with a storyline involving the multiverse, but the duo, already not really interested in the project, declined as they were about to start shooting their own movie about the same concept.[37] Shooting took 38 days,[38] mostly in Simi Valley, California.[39] Much of the film was shot overcranked at a very high frame rate to accommodate extensive time remapping in post production.[40] The Daniels said the kung-fu fight scenes were shot unusually quickly; for example, the fanny-pack fight was shot in a day and a half.[41] Filming wrapped in early March 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[42] The first cut ran around 170 minutes.[40]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects post-production for the film was done in-house, after the Daniels' negative experience with a dedicated post-production studio for their previous film *Swiss Army Man*.[43] Instead, the filmmakers assembled a small team of five artists headed by Zak Stoltz, who produced all visual effects using Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, and used Resilio Sync to share the large amounts of data once the pandemic hit.[43]\n\n\nFor Deirdre's appearance, Kwan discovered a picture of a real IRS agent he found online, which Curtis liked and wanted to emulate. Curtis wanted the character to be as \"real\" as possible and used her real belly for the film, as opposed to a prosthetic.[44]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* incorporates elements from a number of genres and film mediums, including surreal comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts films and animation.[5][6][7] A. O. Scott of *The New York Times* described the film as a \"swirl of genre anarchy\", explaining that \"while the hectic action sequences and flights of science-fiction mumbo-jumbo are a big part of the fun (and the marketing), they aren't really the point. [It is] a bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love\".[7] Laura Zornosa from *The New York Times* elaborates its addressing of intergenerational trauma through healing relationships. Additionally, Emily St. James wrote on Vox that the film is part of a rising subgenre of \"millennial parental apology fantasy\", imagining worlds in which parents and children reconcile.[45]\n\n\nAccording to Charles Bramesco of *The Guardian*, \"The bagel of doom and its tightening grip on Evelyn's daughter lend themselves to the climactic declaration that there's nothing worse than submitting to the nihilism so trendy with the next generation. Our lone hope of recourse is to embrace all the love and beauty surrounding us, if only we're present enough to see it.\"[46] This nihilism is also incorporated into the film's exploration of Asian American identity. Anne Anlin Cheng wrote in *The Washington Post,* \"It's not only that the multiverse acts as a metaphor for the immigrant Asian experience, or a convenient parable for the dislocations and personality splits suffered by hyphenated (that is, 'Asian-American') citizens, including LGBT culture. It also becomes a rather heady vehicle for confronting and negotiating Asian-pessimism\", a term she uses in reference to Afro-pessimism.[47]\n\n\n*Consequence*'s Clint Worthington wrote that \"for all its dadaist absurdism and blink-if-you-miss-it pace, Daniels weaves the chaotic possibilities into the multiverse into a cohesive story about the travails of the road not traveled, and the need to carve out your own meaning in a meaningless universe.\"[48] Describing Jobu Tupaki's modus operandi, Worthington notes \"the living contradiction that is the everything bagel: if you put everything on a bagel, what more is left? And if you've experienced everything that the multiverse can offer, what's the point of any of it?\"[48] Kwan said that the everything bagel concept \"did two things. It allowed us to talk about nihilism without being too eye roll-y. And it creates a MacGuffin: a doomsday device. If, in the first half of the movie, people think that the bagel is here to destroy the world, and in the second half you realize it's a depressed person trying to destroy themselves, it just takes everything about action movies and turns it into something more personal.\"[19] The writer George Gillett argues that the movie is \"a coming-of-age film for the internet generation\", with the multiverse resembling virtual environments which viewers increasingly exist within.[49]\n\n\nThe film engages textually and metatextually with the \"real world\" of the viewer.[50][51] Critics have noted that one version of Evelyn—a famous martial arts movie star—is a portrayal of Yeoh,[51][52][53] that Ke Huy Quan's experience as a stunt coordinator is used diegetically in Waymond's fight scenes,[54] and that James Hong's transformation into \"a more sinister, English-fluent, Machiavellian strategist\" parallels his character Lo Pan in *Big Trouble in Little China* (1986).[50][55]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Experimental band Son Lux composed the score.\nThe musical score was composed by Son Lux, whose members are Ryan Lott, Ian Chang, and Rafiq Bhatia.[56] Daniels asked them to approach the score individually, and not as a band. Lott said, \"I think that the complete picture of not only who we are as a band, but also who we are as individuals and what we have accomplished and the places we've gone creatively individually, meant for them that there was a possibility that many of these universes of sound could be within reach with this particular trio.\"[57]\n\n\nSon Lux took two to three years to compose the score, which includes more than a hundred musical cues.[58] The soundtrack album consists of 49 tracks and runs for more than two hours. It features several prominent musicians,[59] including Mitski, David Byrne, a flute-playing André 3000, Randy Newman, Moses Sumney, Hajnal Pivnick, and yMusic.[25][60][61] Two songs—\"This Is a Life\" featuring Mitski and Byrne[62] and \"Fence\" featuring Sumney—were released as singles on March 4 and 14, 2022.[63] The album was released on March 25 to positive critical response.[64][65]\n\n\nThe film features several instances, both in audio and in dialogue, of the 2000 Nine Days song \"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\". When Daniels contacted Nine Days vocalist John Hampson about using the song, Hampson enthusiastically agreed to record three alternate versions of the song for use in the film.[66][67]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe world premiere was at the South by Southwest film festival on March 11, 2022.[68] Its limited release in theaters was on March 25, 2022,[69] and its nationwide release was on April 8, in the United States by A24.[70] On March 30, 2022, the film was released in select IMAX theaters in the U.S. for one night only. Due to its popularity, the film returned to select IMAX theaters for one week starting on April 29, 2022.[71][72] The film was not released in most parts of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, due to censorship of LGBT issues in those countries.[73] The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 13, 2022.[74] The film was re-released in U.S. theaters on July 29, 2022, unchanged but adding an introduction by Daniels and eight minutes of outtakes after the credits.[75][76] It was re-released again in U.S. theaters on January 27, 2023, on 1,400 screens to celebrate its Oscar nominations.[77][78]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released on digital streaming platforms on June 7, 2022, and was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on July 5, 2022, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment.[79][80]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* grossed $77.2 million in the United States and Canada and $64 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $141.2 million.[4] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the net profit of the film to be $32 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[81]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film earned $509,600 from ten venues in its opening weekend. Its debut had a theater average of $50,965, the second-best since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for a platform release (behind *Licorice Pizza*) and the then-best opening theater average in 2022.[82] In its second weekend, the film grossed $1.1 million from 38 theaters, finishing ninth at the box office.[83] It received a wide expansion in its third weekend, going from 38 to 1,250 theaters.[84][85] It made $6.1 million, finishing sixth at the box office.[86][87] Playing in 2,220 theaters the following weekend, it earned $6.2 million, finishing fourth.[88] In its sixth weekend, it added $5.5 million, part of which was attributed to a wider IMAX release following its successful box office run until then.[5] It added $3.5 million in its seventh weekend,[89] and another $3.3 million in its eighth.[90] By May 21, it had made over $51 million, surpassing *Uncut Gems* ($50 million) as A24's highest-grossing film domestically.[91] By June 9, it had made over $80 million, surpassing *Hereditary* ($79 million) as A24's highest-grossing film of all time.[92] It remained in the box office top ten until its sixteenth weekend, which ended on July 10.[93] The film crossed the $100 million mark worldwide on July 31, making it the first independent film released during the pandemic (and in A24's history) to achieve this distinction.[2]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, other top-earning territories as of July 31 were the United Kingdom ($6.2 million), Canada ($5.1 million), Australia ($4.5 million), Russia ($2.4 million), Taiwan ($2.3 million), Mexico ($2 million), Hong Kong ($1.7 million), Germany ($1.5 million), and the Netherlands ($1.1 million).[2]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michelle Yeoh won the Academy Award for Best Actress, with some reviewers calling her performance the best of her career.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 405 critic reviews are positive for the film and the average rating is 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Led by an outstanding Michelle Yeoh, *Everything Everywhere All at Once* lives up to its title with an expertly calibrated assault on the senses.\"[94] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[95] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave it an 89% positive score, with 77% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[86]\n\n\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire called the film an \"orgiastic work of slaphappy genius\", praising the direction and performances, particularly Yeoh's, calling it the \"greatest performance that Michelle Yeoh has ever given\".[96] *The Hollywood Reporter'*s David Rooney called it a \"frenetically plotted serve of stoner heaven [that] is insanely imaginative and often a lot of fun\", complimenting the cast and score but found the handling of the story's underlying theme underwhelming.[97] In her review for *RogerEbert.com*, Marya E. Gates lauded Yeoh's performance, writing, \"Yeoh is the anchor of the film, given a role that showcases her wide range of talents, from her fine martial art skills to her superb comic timing to her ability to excavate endless depths of rich human emotion, often just from a glance or a reaction.\"[98] Bramesco praised the Daniels for constructing a \"large, elaborate, polished, and detailed expression of a vision,\"[46] Amy Nicholson of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote, \"Over its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, the movie's ambitions double, and double again, as though it's a petri dish teeming with Mr. Kwan and Mr. Scheinert's wildest ideas.\"[18]\n\n\nSome reviewers called Yeoh's performance as the best of her career.[99][100][101] In her review for *Vanity Fair*, Maureen Ryan highlighted it, writing, \"Yeoh imbues Evelyn with moving shades of melancholy, regret, resolve, and growing curiosity\" and adding that she \"makes her embrace of lead-character energy positively gripping.\"[102] Adam Nayman of *The Ringer* referred to the film as \"a love letter to Yeoh [and] extremely poignant, giving its 59-year-old star a chance to flex unexpected acting muscles while revisiting the high-flying fight choreography that made her a global icon back in the 1990s\".[103] In his review for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, Jake Coyle wrote that although it \"can verge on overload, it's this liberating sense of limitless possibility that the movie leaves you filled with, both in its freewheeling anything-goes playfulness and in its surprisingly tender portrait of existential despair\".[104] Tasha Robinson of *Polygon* named the scene of Evelyn and Joy Wang as rocks with their dialogue appearing as on-screen subtitles, all while trying to find common ground, as one of the best movie scenes of 2022, saying \"...it's a perfect moment. Like so many *EEAAO* sequences, it turns between emotions on a dime. But the quiet of the moment is essential. Out of context, it's just an odd moment between rocks. But within the context of the film, it's a breather the audience and characters both desperately need, and the emotions are so heightened that just the sight of rock-Joy and rock-Evelyn sharing a companionable laugh is remarkably heartening and hilarious.\"[105]\n\n\nDissenting reviews include that of Richard Brody for *The New Yorker*, who dismissed it as a \"sickly cynical feature-length directorial pitch reel for a Marvel movie\",[106] and that of Peter Bradshaw for *The Guardian* who described it as \"a formless splurge of Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time\".[107]\n\n\nArmond White of *National Review* wrote: \"Unschooled Marvel addicts who never heard of Kafka, Buñuel, or Chuck Jones easily fall for the entropy farce. The Daniels refuse narrative convention in order to represent our culture's gradual decline into disorder.... The film's ultimate message: \"Be Kind,\" spoken by two rocks. It's a childish palliative.... Yeoh brings adult stability to the blackout-skit chaos and cast of \"stupid human\" clowns. But the Daniels reduce life to \"just a statistical inevitability, it's nothing special.\"\"[108]\n\n\n*The New York Times* named the character Jobu Tupaki, played by Hsu, one of the 93 Most Stylish \"People\" of 2022.[109]\n\n\n\n### Legacy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Screen Rant* ranked it as the \"Best Movie of the 2020s (So Far),\" calling it the \"best, most exciting movie\" on the subject matter of the multiverse and a \"turning point after the box-office-slumping COVID-19 pandemic and superhero-centric 2010s.\"[110] The site also included it on its list of films from the decade that are \"Destined To Become Classics,\" calling it \"both a massively entertaining sci-fi actioner and a deeply affecting family drama.\"[111] It also ranked number 2 on *MovieWeb*'s list of the \"Best LGBTQ+ Movies of the 2020s (So Far)\" and number 13 on the its list of \"20 Movies That Require Your Full Attention From Start to Finish.\" For the latter list, Taryn Flaherty wrote, \"...there is not a second of this 139-minute eccentric film that does not demand your dedicated attention. With the multiverse driving the story's narrative forward, it should come as no surprise that every detail of this film will require its viewer to remain focused.\"[112][113] *IndieWire* ranked it at number 8 on its list of the \"50 Best Action Movies of the 21st Century\" and number 5 on its list of the \"55 Best Science Fiction Films of the 21st Century.\"[114][115] It also ranked number 33 on *Comic Book Resources*' list of \"The Best Movies of All Time.\"[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Everything Everywhere All at Once*\n\nPrior to the 95th Academy Awards, *IGN* reported that *Everything Everywhere All at Once* had already surpassed *The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) as \"the most awarded film of all time\".[9][117]\n\n\nIt won seven of its 11 Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Yeoh), Best Supporting Actor (Quan), Best Supporting Actress (Curtis), Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.[118][119] The film received 10 BAFTA nominations (winning one),[120] 13 Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations (winning five),[121] eight Independent Spirit Awards nominations (winning a record-breaking seven),[122] and six Golden Globe Awards nominations (winning two).[123] It was named one of the top 10 films of 2022 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[124][125] The film also won top prizes from the Directors Guild of America Awards, Producers Guild of America Awards, Writers Guild of America Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards (the last of which it won a record-breaking four awards);[126] the film became the 5th film to sweep all four top prizes from the major guilds (DGA, PGA, WGA, SAG), after *American Beauty*, *No Country for Old Men*, *Slumdog Millionaire*, and *Argo* (all 5 films ended up winning Best Picture at their respective Academy Awards).[127]\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* made Academy Awards history in several categories. Yeoh was the first woman of Chinese ethnicity to win Best Actress, the second woman of color after Halle Berry in 2002, and the first Malaysian to win any Academy Award. Stephanie Hsu's nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category, alongside Hong Chau's nomination for *The Whale*, marked the first time two actresses of Asian ethnicity were nominated in that category in the same year. Ke Huy Quan is the first Vietnam-born actor to win an Academy Award. It is also the first science-fiction film to win Best Picture,[128] and the first science-fiction film to win five of the top six Academy Awards. While no film has ever won in all four acting categories, it was the third to win three out of four, after *A Streetcar Named Desire* (1951) and *Network* (1976),[129] and the first to also win Best Picture.[130]\n\n\nThe reaction to the film's Best Picture win was not without criticism, with Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* feeling that the Academy \"chose the wrong best picture\" and believed that now, as a result, \"films that enter the race reeking too obviously of traditional Oscar quality — a group that includes not only *The Fabelmans* but also two earlier Spielberg pictures, *The Post* and *West Side Story* — run the risk of falling by the wayside,\" and compared its win to that of *CODA* at the previous ceremony.[131] Cannes Film Festival president Thierry Frémaux was also happy with the result but felt mixed, saying: \"I thought the ceremony was very good and I was happy to see Michelle Yeoh rewarded. And disappointed that Steven Spielberg wasn't, because his film is a love letter to cinema.\"[132]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Asian Americans in arts and entertainment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\". *British Board of Film Classification*.
