Notable variants include Diet Mountain Dew, Baja Blast, Code Red, LiveWire, Voltage, Major Melon, and Spark.\n\n\n\n\n## Flavors[edit]\n\n\n### Current[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Dates of production\n | Notes\n | Picture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mountain Dew\n | 1940\u2013present\n | A citrus-flavored soda developed in the 1940s by Barney and Ally Hartman, beverage bottlers in Tennessee. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1959. High-fructose corn syrup replaced sugar in the 1990s, though today there is a modified variant made with cane sugar known as Mountain Dew Real Sugar. A zero sugar variant was introduced in 2020. It is notable for including orange juice in the recipe.\n | ![](image) |\n| Diet Mountain Dew | 1988\u2013present\n | A low-calorie variant first introduced in 1988, replacing the similar drink \"Sugar Free Mountain Dew\".[1]\nIn 2006, Diet Mountain Dew was reformulated with a new \"Tuned Up Taste\", using a blend of sucralose, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium as sweeteners. The previous formulation was sweetened exclusively with aspartame.[2]\n | ![](image) |\n| Diet Caffeine-Free Mountain Dew\n | 1989\u2013present\n | A variant without sugar or caffeine, available in parts of the United States.\n |  |\n| Mountain Dew Real Sugar\n | 2009\u2013present\n | A variant containing natural sugar in place of high-fructose corn syrup released during mid-2009 under the name Mountain Dew Throwback.[3] It was initially re-released for brief periods (generally 8\u201312 weeks at a time), including a 2nd wave from December 2009 \u2013 February 2010[4] and a 3rd wave in Summer/Fall 2010.[5] A fourth limited production run began in March 2011, lasting for eight weeks, before it became a permanent addition.[6]\nIn 2020, Mountain Dew Throwback was rebranded as Mountain Dew Real Sugar, with a new design using the 1980s Mountain Dew logo, with the words \"Real Sugar\" in a similar font.\n |  |\n| Mountain Dew Baja Blast | 2004\u2013present (fountain, exclusive to Taco Bell);\n2014-2016, 2018-present (retail, summer only)\n | A tropical lime variant introduced in 2004 exclusively as a fountain drink at Taco Bell restaurants. On May 5, 2014, Baja Blast received a limited release in stores by popular demand. In April 2015, Baja Blast released in retail stores for a limited time, accompanied by an in-store release of sister flavor Sangrita Blast. In 2016, the flavor was re-released for the \"DEWcision\" contest for a limited time, where it lost to Pitch Black.[7] The drink has seen reoccurring, seasonal summer retail releases from 2018 onwards.\nA diet version was briefly offered in Taco Bell fountains in 2015. A zero sugar version was introduced in 2019, and has since seen packaged releases alongside original Baja Blast.\n | ![](image) |\n| Mountain Dew Code Red | 2001\u2013present\n | A cherry variant introduced in 2001 and the first widely successful flavor extension.

The company was founded in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1977 by Jack Fulk and Richard Thomas.[3]\n\n\nBojangles has locations in Honduras and previously franchised restaurants in Grand Cayman Island, Jamaica, Mexico, Ireland[4] and China.[5][6] As of 2023[update], restaurants are in 17 U.S. states[7] (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia) with planned expansions into New Jersey.[8] Its home state of North Carolina has the largest number of locations.[9]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the company announced plans to open 20 restaurants on the West coast, starting in Las Vegas.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo used from 1977 until 2020\nThe first Bojangles location opened in 1977 in Charlotte. In the following year, the first franchised restaurant began operations.\n\n\nJack Fulk sold the Bojangles concept to the now-defunct Horn & Hardart Company of New York[11] in 1981.\n\n\nBojangles received fame in 1989 because its restaurants remained open when Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolinas when most other fast-food restaurants had closed.[12]\n\n\nDuring Horn and Hardart's ownership, the chain grew rapidly and expanded to 335 restaurants including 100 in Florida. Part of this growth was fueled by acquisitions including the Florida-based Biscuits chain.\n\n\nIn 1990, Horn and Hardart sold most of its interest to Sienna Partners and Interwest Partners. The company was then headed by the former KFC executive, Dick Campbell. In 1994, the company attempted a public offering. Campbell was subsequently replaced by CEO Jim Peterson. The company was sold to a group of investors headed by the former Wendy's executive Joe Drury and financed by FMAC in 1998.[13]\n\n\nBojangles expanded throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with the 300th location opened in 2003. The restaurant started its first college campus location on the grounds of Central Piedmont Community College in 2005. The company also purchased naming rights to the original Charlotte Coliseum on Independence Boulevard in Charlotte.\n\n\nBojangles was purchased again in 2007 by Falfurrias Capital Partners,[14] a private equity firm. The first airport location was opened in 2008 at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. In August 2011, Falfurrias sold Bojangles to Boston-based Advent International, another private equity firm, after a competitive bidding process with other investors.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for Bojangles' at Durham Athletic Park in Durham, North Carolina (1989)\nIn 2012, Bojangles began sponsoring the NASCAR race Bojangles' Southern 500, and opened another college campus restaurant at UNC Greensboro.[16]\n\n\nThe company's 600th restaurant opened on July 8, 2014, on Galleria Road in Charlotte with Charlotte mayor Dan Clodfelter cutting the celebratory ribbon.[17]\n\n\nIn April 2015, the company filed with the US regulator for an initial public offering of its common stock, expecting to raise $372 million.[18]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Randy Kibler was replaced by Jose Armario as the chief executive officer and brought with him Brian Unger as the chief operating officer.

The company has operations across most of the United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam) and Canada, as well as in China, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates; as of June 23, 2020, the company had 719 locations worldwide.[6][1] Golden Gate Capital became Red Lobster's parent company when it was acquired from Darden Restaurants on July 28, 2014.[7] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million, and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC.[8]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2014, Red Lobster announced its new headquarters location in CNL Center City Commons in Orlando.[9] On March 6, 2015, Red Lobster officially opened the Restaurant Support Center.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Formation and growth[edit]\n\n\nThe first Red Lobster restaurant was opened on January 18, 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, by entrepreneurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby.[11][12] The oft-quoted date of March 27, 1968 is based on the incorporation date of Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. (now GMRI, Inc.) in the Florida Secretary of State's Office.[13]\n\n\nOriginally billed as the \"Harbor for Seafood Lovers\", the first restaurant was followed by four others throughout the American South. In 1970, General Mills acquired Red Lobster as a five-unit company and with new backing, the chain expanded rapidly in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n![](image)A Lobsterfest duo meal\nRed Lobster entered Canada in the 1980s, in many cases by buying Ponderosa restaurant locations. Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada, the bulk in larger urban centres in Ontario (across southern Ontario plus one in Sudbury, in northern Ontario) with a smaller number in larger urban centres in all three Prairie provinces. It exited the Quebec market in September 1997, due to financial losses, and never attempted to enter British Columbia[14]\n\n\nIn 1992, Red Lobster introduced its now famous Cheddar Bay Biscuits, developed by culinary leader Kurt Hankins.[15]\n\n\nOn March 29, 1994, Bill Darden died, after an extended illness, at the age of 75.[16]\n\n\nIn 1995, Red Lobster (along with Olive Garden and other sister chains), became part of Darden Restaurants, Inc. During that time, General Mills decided to release Darden into an independent, publicly traded corporation.[5]\n\n\n\n### 2009 prototype and sale[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The \"Bar Harbor\" prototype design as seen at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana location\nIn 2009, Red Lobster debuted its new Bar Harbor restaurant prototype modeled after coastal New England architecture.[17] The new exterior features include shingle and stone towers, signal flags, and Adirondack-style benches. The interior updates include dark wood paneling, warm-toned fabrics, soft lighting, and nautical decor and artwork.[18]\n\n\nOn December 19, 2013, Darden Restaurants announced plans to sell or spin off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors.[19] This was in direct response to Darden's going over budget on a new digital platform.[20]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of its spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations.[21] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.[22] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.[23]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2014, Red Lobster announced their new headquarters location in CNL Center City Commons in Orlando.[9] On March 6, 2015, Red Lobster officially opened the Restaurant Support Center.[10] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million, and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC.[8]\n\n\n\n## Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A basket of Cheddar Bay Biscuits from Red Lobster\nRed Lobster has offered an endless snow crab leg promotion twice in its history (as of September 2003). However, in 2003, the promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants', taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris's departure from the company.\n\n\nThe ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the amount of time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour.[24]\n\n\nIn February 2016, American singer Beyonc\u00e9 referenced Red Lobster in her single \"Formation\". After unexpectedly releasing the single and performing it during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, Red Lobster reported a 33% sales increase due to the reference.[25]\n\n\nRed Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals.[26]\n\n\n\n## Menu[edit]\n\n\nThe brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp. It also serves chicken, desserts, pasta, and steak.[27][*promotional source?*]\n\n\n\n### Lobster bisque controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, *Inside Edition* reported that Red Lobster used a mix of less expensive langostino along with Maine lobster in their lobster bisque recipe.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Locations[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 23, 2020, the company had 719 locations worldwide. These locations span 44 US states (including Puerto Rico, Guam), China, Canada, Ecuador, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.[6][1]\n\n\n\n* ![The Red Lobster in Kitchener, Ontario (2013).

It later expanded to many locations across North Carolina. It was independently operated until it was acquired by the Belgium-based conglomerate Delhaize Group in 1974.[6][7] In 1983, the company changed its name and branding to Food Lion to allow it to expand into regions where *Food Town* was already in use by unrelated stores. Following further mergers and acquisitions, Food Lion, LLC is currently owned by Ahold Delhaize. The mascot\u2019s name has been George the Food Lion since January 17, 1997[*citation needed*].\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFood Lion was founded in 1957 in Salisbury, North Carolina, as Food Town by Wilson Smith, Ralph Ketner, and Brown Ketner. The Food Town chain was acquired by the Belgium-based Delhaize Group grocery company in 1974.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dairy section of a Food Lion in Hampton, Virginia\nThe Food Lion name was adopted in 1983; as *Food Town* expanded into Virginia, the chain encountered several stores called Foodtown in the Richmond area. Expansion into Maryland would have been a bigger problem since about 100 independent, but affiliated, stores were called *Food Town*. Because Delhaize had a lion in its logo, *Food Town* had asked to use it on product labels and new store signs. Ralph Ketner realized \"lion\" needed only two new letters and the movement of another in the chain's signs. On December 12, 1982, Ketner announced the name change to \"Food Lion,\" and by the end of March 1983, all stores had been rebranded.[8] The name change, while puzzling for American customers, made economic and historic sense, as Delhaize was once known as \"Delhaize Le Lion.\"\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Food Lion expanded throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. The company continued their expansion throughout the late 1980s, opening hundreds of stores in existing markets such as the Carolinas and the Virginias, and entering new markets such as Georgia and Maryland.\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Food Lion stores appeared in new markets such as Delaware and southern Pennsylvania; Orlando, Florida; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Shreveport, Louisiana; Dallas/Fort Worth; and Houston, Texas. (Of these eight markets Food Lion penetrated in the 1990s, the only ones that still have stores are Delaware and parts of southern Pennsylvania, such as Hanover). During this time, the chain was the fastest-growing supermarket company in the U.S., as they opened over 100 new stores each year.[9] In November 1992, a critical *PrimeTime Live* report that showed unsanitary handling of meat and seafood hurt the chain as they attempted to enter new markets in the Northeast and Southwest.[10][11] (See ABC PrimeTime Live section, below.)\n\n\nAccording to some industry sources, the new stores in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma were already operating below sales projections. The small, lackluster Food Lion stores were beginning to compete with national retail leaders, such as Albertsons, Kroger, Tom Thumb, and Jewel-Osco, all of which were already well-respected in the Southwest and which operated larger stores with more features, but the effects of the devastating ABC report could not be denied, and sales and revenue plummeted.[10] In the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, widespread reports were given of stores sending half of their staff home early due to lack of business and of other stores with \"virtually zero meat sales\". In the fiscal quarter that included the Thanksgiving holiday of 1992, Delhaize America reported company-wide same-store sales declines of 9.5%.[12] As a result, Food Lion was forced to greatly scale back its expansion plans in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as delay, then cancel its planned entry into new markets in Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois.\n\n\n\n![](image)Interior of a store in Southern Shores, North Carolina. The interior has since been updated to the Ahold Delhaize look in mid-2018.\nIn 1993, Food Lion agreed to pay $16.2 million to settle claims that they violated federal laws regulating unpaid overtime, minimum wage, and child labor, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In the agreement, which at the time was the largest settlement ever from a private employer accused of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the grocery chain agreed to ensure that all employees would be well-informed about their rights. Additionally, the Labor Department said Food Lion top management provided assurances that no retaliatory action would be taken against employees who filed complaints about unpaid overtime or other potential FLSA violations.[13] On January 7, 1994, Delhaize announced the first major round of store closings in what would become a yearly event. The stores to be closed included 47 of its brand-new stores in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as stores in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia.[14]\n\n\nThroughout the mid-1990s, the company canceled leases for new stores and closed scores of its newly built outlets in recently established markets such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and Oklahoma City.[15][16] Citing double-digit same-store sales declines for the quarter ending in September 1997, Delhaize announced that it was canceling its Midwest expansion, exiting all markets in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, and closing its 6-year-old distribution center in Roanoke, Texas.[17] A bruised and battered Food Lion was forced to recede back to the East Coast, where it faced increasing competition from competitors with larger stores, better customer service, and more variety and amenities; these included regional winners such as Ingles, Harris Teeter, and Publix; newcomers such as specialty retailer Whole Foods Market; and expanding national chains such as Kroger, Target, and Wal-Mart.\n\n\nBeginning in 2003, Food Lion became active in \"market renewals\" in which every year Food Lion picks certain cities in their operating area where they remodel stores and update the product offerings. That same year, Food Lion remodeled 68 stores in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina market, followed by 65 stores in the Charlotte area in 2004. In 2006, Food Lion advanced their market renewals program by using demographic and geographic data to figure out whether certain stores should be branded as Food Lion, Bloom, or Bottom Dollar. If the data supported that an already existing Food Lion was adequate for a certain community, the location would simply be remodeled. Should the data support otherwise, the Food Lion store would be remodeled and rebranded as either Bloom or Bottom Dollar.[18] In early 2012, Food Lion closed 113 stores. These were in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee as well as all the stores in Florida.[19]\n\n\n\n### New concept, mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2013, Food Lion introduced a new concept and decor at a store in Concord, North Carolina. The first official remodel began in late 2014 to 76 of their stores in the greater Wilmington and Greenville, North Carolina markets. In March 2015, plans were announced for remodeling of its 162 locations in the Raleigh, North Carolina, market. The Raleigh market remodels were expected to be completed in stores on a rolling basis between April and October 2015. In June 2015, it was announced that Food Lion's parent company, the Delhaize Group, and Ahold would merge into Ahold Delhaize. This merger was completed in July 2016.[20] In March 2016, the company announced that they would make a $215 million investment in its greater Charlotte-area stores and western NC stores. This included remodeling 142 stores, additional price investments, and investments in associates and the community through its *Food Lion Feeds* initiatives.[21][22]\nIn July 2016, as part of the corporate merger between Delhaize and Ahold, Food Lion was required to divest 61 locations to a variety of competitors including Supervalu and Weis Markets in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's review of the two parent companies' merger.[23] Later that year, Food Lion began remodeling 93 of their stores in the Piedmont Triad region. Remodeling in the Piedmont Triad was completed in the summer of 2017. Richmond, Virginia stores began getting the concepts implemented in 2017. On March 14, 2018, Supervalu announced that Food Lion was purchasing three Farm Fresh locations in Elizabeth City, North Carolina and Hampton and Virginia Beach, Virginia as part of a larger deal to close down the Farm Fresh brand.[24] On April 27, 2018, Food Lion announced plans to acquire four BI-LO locations in Florence, Myrtle Beach, Surfside Beach, and Columbia, South Carolina.[25] Furthermore, on June 3, 2020, Food Lion announced the purchase of 62 Southeastern Grocers stores in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These stores have been rebranded to Food Lion between February and May 2021.[26]\n\n\nFood Lion stores can currently be found in Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.[27]\n\n\nFood Lion's sister chains include Giant-Carlisle, Giant-Landover, Hannaford Brothers, Martin's Food Markets and Stop & Shop.\n\n\n\n![](image)Food Lion featuring new signage in Nags Head, North Carolina\n### International stores[edit]\n\n\nFood Lion spent seven years attempting to establish a presence in Bangkok, Thailand, starting in 1997. Operated locally by Bel-Thai Supermarket Co, in 2004 it withdrew from the country, selling all branches to Tops Supermarkets.[28]\n\n\n\n### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nFor 20 consecutive years, Food Lion has been named Energy Star Partner of the Year and has received the Sustained Excellence Award for 18 consecutive years for its sustainability efforts.[29] In partnership with parent company Ahold Delhaize USA, Food Lion aims to commit to heightened sustainability efforts, which include greater food transparency by 2025; reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 via composting, recycling and animal feed; and a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from its operations and 15% reduction for its supply chains by 2030. Since 2000, Food Lion and Feeding America have partnered to reduce food waste by donating more than 300 million meals to Food Lion's communities through their food rescue initiative. Retailers nationwide implement the food program within their local communities.[30]\n\n\n\n### Promotions and Deals[edit]\n\n\nFood Lion renews every Wednesday the deals and promotions, in the weekly ad. [31]\n\n\n\n## Former banners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Food Lion in Durham, North Carolina. The store has since remodeled to the new signage in 2015.\n### Bloom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bloom (store)\n\n![](image)Bloom store in Accokeek, Maryland. Since 2016, it has been a Weis Markets store.\nBloom was Food Lion's upscale grocery model that opened on May 26, 2004.\n\n\nAs of December 2009, 65 Bloom stores were in North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia.[32]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2011, Delhaize announced that all Bloom supermarkets in North and South Carolina would close or be converted to the Food Lion banner.[33]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Delhaize announced that the Bloom brand would be discontinued and that all Bloom supermarkets would either convert to Food Lion or permanently close.[34]\n\n\n\n### Bottom Dollar Food[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bottom Dollar Food\n\nBottom Dollar Food was Food Lion's discount grocery model that focused on offering a limited selection of both national brands and private label products. These stores had no bakeries or delis and more items were packaged. Customers bought the bags used to sack their own groceries at Bottom Dollar Food. Stores also used alternative display and stocking techniques such as cut cases on shelves, and using pallets and dump bins to reduce costs. Food Lion opened the first Bottom Dollar Food model in High Point, North Carolina, on September 21, 2005.\n\n\nAs of December 2009, Bottom Dollar Food had 28 stores in North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[35] In January 2012, Delhaize announced that it would close six Bottom Dollar stores and convert 22 others to Food Lion supermarkets as part of a restructuring.[36][37] In August 2014, it was reported that Delhaize was putting the entire portfolio of Bottom Dollar Food locations up for sale.[38] Ultimately Bottom Dollar Food was shuttered and the stores sold to Aldi in early 2015.\n\n\n\n### Harveys Supermarket[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harveys Supermarket\n\nHarveys stores are mainly located in rural markets within the Deep South. In May 2013, all Harveys stores were sold to BI-LO LLC.\n\n\n\n### Reid's[edit]\n\n\nReid's was a small chain of stores located in various rural South Carolina communities. The chain's history can trace back to 1972, when its namesake founder Reid Boylston opened his first store in Barnwell, South Carolina.[39] Most of these stores were all formerly branded as Food Lion stores and continue to carry Food Lion branded goods and use the Food Lion infrastructure. In May 2013, Reid's was sold along with its sister supermarket chains Harveys and Sweetbay to BI-LO LLC for $265 million.[40] BI-LO subsequently retired the Reid's name, rebranding the Reid's stores as BI-LO.\n\n\n\n## Store brand[edit]\n\n\nDelhaize America stores use common private brands called Home 360, Nature's Promise, CHA-CHING, and Taste of Inspirations. Sister supermarkets Hannaford and Sweetbay were the last two stores to make the switch, doing so in 2010 and 2011. The move is designed to simplify the company's store-brand products line.[41] Food Lion stores have the My Essentials brand, as well as the Hannaford brand.\nAt the end of 2014, the My Essentials, as well as the Home 360 names, were retired and the more traditional Food Lion brand name was used as a replacement.\n\n\n\n## Slogans[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Food Lion spokesman Michael Mozingo denied the allegations, stating that \"We don't pay less. Our wages are comparable in every market we operate.\"[44] In 1990, labor leaders in Virginia called for a boycott of Food Lion, accusing the chain of paying workers substandard wages and blocking attempts by store workers to unionize. In Belgium, labor organizers observed the American Labor Day as a statement of solidarity with Food Lion labor organizers.[45]\n\n\n\n### *Primetime Live* controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Food Lion gained a degree of notoriety when it was the subject of an ABC News investigation. ABC had received a tip about unsanitary practices at Food Lion. Two ABC reporters had posed as Food Lion employees, and witnessed the unsanitary practices at Food Lion. Much of what they had seen was videotaped with cameras hidden in wigs that they were wearing. The footage was then featured in a segment on the news magazine *Primetime Live*, in which Food Lion employees described unsanitary practices, which included bleaching discolored, expired pork with Clorox and repackaging expired meats with new expiration dates, and the use of nail polish remover to remove the expiration dates from dairy item packages.\n\n\nThe company responded by suing ABC for fraud, claiming that the ABC employees misrepresented themselves; for trespassing, because the ABC employees came on to Food Lion property without permission; and for breach of duty of loyalty, because the ABC employees videotaped nonpublic areas of the store and revealed internal company information. During the court battles between Food Lion and ABC, over 40 hours of unused footage were released that helped Food Lion's case. In the unused footage, two undercover producers are seen trying to encourage violations of company policy; however, employees resisted and correctly followed sanitary practices.[46]\n\n\nFood Lion was awarded US$5.5 million by a jury in 1997. The award was later reduced by a judge to $316,000. The verdict was then largely overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. According to the court: even though ABC was wrong to do what they had done, Food Lion was not suing for defamation, but rather for tort as a way to get around the strict First Amendment standards for defamation. Food Lion did this because the company was not contesting the truth of anything ABC reported in the broadcast.[47] However, the appellate court upheld the finding that the producers involved breached their duty of loyalty as employees to Food Lion, and had trespassed, awarding a nominal $2 fine.[48]\n\n\n\n### Religious discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Food Lion was sued for religious discrimination by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after a meat cutter at a Winston-Salem Food Lion was fired for declining to work on Sundays or Thursdays evenings. The meat cutter was a Jehovah's Witness minister who was required to attend religious services and meetings on those days. The EEOC sought back pay and compensatory and punitive damages. Food Lion agreed to pay the worker $50,500.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Mega Image\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Supermarkets\n* ![flag](image) United States\n* ![](image) Companies\n* ![icon](image) Food\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Food Lion's deal to acquire dozens of Bi-Lo, Harveys Supermarket stores takes step forward\". *www.bizjournals.com*.

Located in the Piedmont region, it is the county seat of Mecklenburg County. The population was 874,579 at the 2020 census,[10] making Charlotte the 15th-most populous city in the United States, the seventh-most populous city in the South, and the second-most populous city in the Southeast behind Jacksonville, Florida. The city is the cultural, economic, and transportation center of the Charlotte metropolitan area, whose 2020 population of 2,660,329 ranked 22nd in the United States.[9] Metrolina is part of a sixteen-county market region or combined statistical area with a 2020 population of 2,822,352.[11]\n\n\nBetween 2004 and 2014, Charlotte was ranked as the country's fastest-growing metro area, with 888,000 new residents.[12][13][14][15][16] Based on U.S. census data from 2005 to 2015, Charlotte tops the U.S. in millennial population growth.[17][18][19][20] It is the third-fastest-growing major city in the United States.[21][22][23][24] Residents are referred to as \"Charlotteans\".[25][26]\n\n\nCharlotte is home to the corporate headquarters of Bank of America, Truist Financial, and the East Coast headquarters of Wells Fargo, which along with other financial institutions has made it the second-largest banking center in the United States.[27][28][29][30]\n\n\nCharlotte's notable attractions include three professional sports teams, the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, and Charlotte FC of MLS. The city is also home to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Opera Carolina, the Charlotte Symphony, the Charlotte Ballet, Children's Theatre of Charlotte, Mint Museum, Harvey B. Gantt Center, Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, the Billy Graham Library, Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte Museum of History, Carowinds amusement park, and the U.S. National Whitewater Center.[31][32][33][34][35][36]\n\n\nCharlotte has a humid subtropical climate. It is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest human-made lake in North Carolina.[37][38] Lake Wylie and Mountain Island Lake are two smaller human-made lakes located near the city.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n### Early history through American Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queen Charlotte of Great Britain and Ireland, c. 1779\nThe Catawba Indians were the first known historic tribe to settle Mecklenburg County (in the Charlotte area) and were first recorded around 1567 in Spanish records. By 1759 half the Catawba tribe had died from smallpox, which was endemic among European colonists because the Catawba had not acquired immunity to the new disease. At the time of their largest population, Catawba people numbered 10,000, but by 1826 their total population had dropped to 110.[41]\n\n\nThe city of Charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of Scots-Irish Presbyterians, or Ulster-Scot settlers from Northern Ireland, who dominated the culture of the Southern Piedmont Region. They made up the principal founding population in the backcountry. German immigrants also settled in the area before the American Revolutionary War, but in much smaller numbers. They still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region.\n\n\nMecklenburg County was initially part of Bath County (1696 to 1729) of the New Hanover Precinct, which became New Hanover County in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into Bladen County in 1734, and its western portion split into Anson County in 1750. Mecklenburg County was formed from Anson County in 1762. Further apportionment was made in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War, with Cabarrus County formed from Mecklenburg.[42]\n\n\nIn 1842, Union County formed from Mecklenburg's southeastern portion and a western portion of Anson County. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the Salisbury District.[43]\n\n\nThe area that is now Charlotte was first settled by European colonists around 1755 when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. Thomas Polk (great-uncle of President James K. Polk), who later married Thomas Spratt's daughter, built his house by the intersection of two Native American trading paths between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers.[44]\nOne path ran north\u2013south and was part of the Great Wagon Road; the second path ran east\u2013west along what is now Trade Street.\n\n\nNicknamed the \"Queen City\",[45] like its county a few years earlier, Charlotte was named in honor of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had become the queen consort of Great Britain and Ireland in 1761, seven years before the town's incorporation.[46] A second nickname derives from the American Revolutionary War, when British commander General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents. He wrote that Charlotte was \"a hornet's nest of rebellion\", leading to the nickname \"The Hornet's Nest\".[47]\n\n\nWithin decades of Polk's settling, the area grew to become the Town of Charlotte, incorporated in 1768.[48] Though chartered as Charlotte, the name appears as a form of \"Charlottesburgh\" on many maps until around 1800.[49] A form of \"Charlottetown\" also appears on maps of British origin depicting General Cornwallis' route of invasion.[50] The crossroads in Piedmont became the heart of Uptown Charlotte. In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development. The east\u2013west trading path became Trade Street, and the Great Wagon Road became Tryon Street, in honor of William Tryon, a royal governor of colonial North Carolina.[51]\nThe intersection of Trade and Tryon\u2014commonly known today as \"Trade & Tryon\", or simply \"The Square\"[44]\u2014is more properly called \"Independence Square\".[52]\n\n\nWhile surveying the boundary between the Carolinas in 1772, William Moultrie stopped in Charlotte, whose five or six houses were \"very ordinary built of logs\".[53]\n\n\nLocal leaders came together in 1775 and signed the Mecklenburg Resolves, more popularly known as the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. While not a true declaration of independence from British rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the American Revolution. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as \"MecDec\", with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina's state flag and state seal also bear the date.\n\n\n\n### Late 18th century through 19th century[edit]\n\n\nCharlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern Presbyterianism, but in the 19th\u00a0century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic formed, eventually giving Charlotte the nickname, \"The City of Churches\".[54]\n\n\nIn 1799, in nearby Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17- pound rock, which his family used as a doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50.[55] The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first gold rush. Many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint.[56] North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States, until the Sierra Nevada find in 1848,[57] although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.\n\n\nSome groups still pan for gold occasionally in local streams and creeks. The Reed Gold Mine operated until 1912.[58] The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861, when Confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the Civil War. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the Mint Museum of Art.\n\n\nThe city's first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.[59]\n\n\nCharlotte's city population at the 1890 census grew to 11,557.[60]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century to present[edit]\n\n\nIn 1910, Charlotte surpassed Wilmington to become North Carolina's largest city with 34,014 residents.[61]\n\n\nThe population grew again during World War I, when the U.S. government established Camp Greene, north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the Piedmont Crescent. In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.[62]\n\n\nUntil 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.[63][64]\n\n\nThe city's modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, largely under the leadership of financier Hugh McColl. McColl transformed North Carolina National Bank (NCNB) into a formidable national bank that through aggressive acquisitions eventually merged with BankAmerica to become Bank of America. First Union, later Wachovia in 2001, experienced similar growth before it was acquired by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo in 2008. Measured by control of assets, Charlotte became the second largest banking headquarters in the United States after New York City.[65]\n\n\nOn September 22, 1989, the city was hit by Hurricane Hugo. With sustained winds of 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) and gusts of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h),[66] Hugo caused massive property damage, destroyed 80,000 trees, and knocked out electrical power to most of the population. Residents were without power for weeks, schools were closed for a week or more, and the cleanup took months. The city was caught unprepared; Charlotte is 200 miles (320\u00a0km) inland, and residents from coastal areas in both Carolinas often wait out hurricanes in Charlotte.[67]\n\n\nIn December 2002, Charlotte and much of central North Carolina were hit by an ice storm that resulted in more than 1.3\u00a0million people losing power.[68] During an abnormally cold December, many were without power for weeks. Many of the city's Bradford pear trees split apart under the weight of the ice.\n\n\nIn August 2015 and September 2016, the city experienced several days of protests related to the police shootings of Jonathan Ferrell and Keith Scott.[69][70]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 312.00 square miles (808.1\u00a0km2), of which 310.02 square miles (802.9\u00a0km2) is land and 1.98 square miles (5.1\u00a0km2) (0.63%) is water.[7] Charlotte is the twenty-sixth-most expansive city in the United States and lies at an elevation of 751 feet (229\u00a0m).\nCharlotte constitutes most of Mecklenburg County in the Carolina Piedmont.[71] Uptown Charlotte sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek, and was built on the gunnies of the St. Catherine's and Rudisill gold mines.[72] Charlotte is 25 miles (40\u00a0km) southwest of Concord,[73] 26 miles (42\u00a0km) northeast of Rock Hill, South Carolina,[74] 83 miles (134\u00a0km) southwest of Greensboro,[75] 135 miles (217\u00a0km) west of Fayetteville,[76] and 165 miles (266\u00a0km) southwest of Raleigh, the state capitol.[77]\n\n\nThough the Catawba River and its lakes lie several miles west, there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center.[78] Consequently, development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size. The lack of these obstructions has contributed to Charlotte's growth as a highway, rail, and air transportation hub.[79]\n\n\n\n### Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Charlotte neighborhoods and List of tallest buildings in Charlotte\n\n![](image)Uptown Charlotte\n![](image)South Park neighborhood\n![](image)NoDa neighborhood and arts district in North CharlotteCharlotte has 199\u00a0neighborhoods radiating in all directions from Uptown.[80][81] Biddleville, the primary historic center of Charlotte's African American community, is west of Uptown, starting at the Johnson C. Smith University campus and extending to the airport.[82][83][84] East of The Plaza and north of Central Avenue, Plaza-Midwood is known for its international population, including Eastern Europeans, Greeks, Middle-Easterners, and Hispanics.[85][86][87] North Tryon and the Sugar Creek area include several Asian American communities.[88][89] NoDa (North Davidson), north of Uptown, is an emerging center for arts and entertainment.[90][91][92] Myers Park, Dilworth, and Eastover are home to some of Charlotte's most affluent, oldest and largest houses, on tree-lined boulevards, with Freedom Park nearby.[93][94][95][96][97]\n\n\nThe SouthPark area offers shopping, dining, and multifamily housing.[98][99] Far South Boulevard is home to a large Hispanic community.[100] Many students, researchers, and affiliated professionals live near UNC\u00a0Charlotte in the northeast area known as University City.[101][102][103]\n\n\nThe large area known as Southeast Charlotte is home to many golf communities, luxury developments, churches, the Jewish community center, and private schools. As undeveloped land within Mecklenburg has become scarce, many of these communities have expanded into Weddington and Waxhaw in Union County.[104] Ballantyne, in the south of Charlotte, and nearly every area on the I\u2011485 perimeter, has experienced rapid growth over the past ten years.[105][106][107] The Steele Creek neighborhood which is primarily in Mecklenburg county is located within minutes near Uptown Charlotte.[108][109][110][111]\n\n\nSince the 1980s in particular, Uptown Charlotte has undergone massive construction of buildings, housing Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Hearst Corporation, and Duke Energy, several hotels, and multiple condominium developments.[112][113][114][115][116]\n\n\n\n### Parks and green space[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Little Sugar Creek Greenway at East 4th Street overpass\n![](image)A view of Romare Bearden Park, also located in Uptown Charlotte\n![](image)Fountain of First Ward Park, located in the First Ward neighborhood of Uptown Charlotte.[117]The 120\u2011acre Park Road Park is a prominent landmark near the SouthPark area.[118] Park Road Park features eight basketball courts, two horseshoe pits, six baseball fields, five picnic shelters, volleyball courts, playgrounds, trails, tennis courts, and an eleven-acre lake.[119] The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Parks & Recreation Department operates 36 tennis facilities and the 12 lighted tennis courts at the park.[120] In September 2013, the 5.4 acre Romare Bearden Park opened to the public.[121][122]\n\n\nThe urban section of Little Sugar Creek Greenway was completed in 2012. Inspired in part by the San Antonio River Walk, and integral to Charlotte's extensive urban park system, it is \"a huge milestone\" according to Gwen Cook, greenway planner for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation.[123] However, the Little Sugar Creek Greenway bears no relation to the San Antonio River Walk. The Little Sugar Creek Greenway is prone to flooding during thunderstorms and periods of heavy rain. Creation of Little Sugar Creek Greenway cost $43 million and was controversial because it required the forced acquisition of several established local businesses.[124]\n\n\nThe city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County began purchasing flood-prone homes in the 1990s. Voluntary buyouts of 700 households have created around 200 acres of open land that can flood safely, thereby saving an estimated $28 million in flood damage and emergency rescues.[125]\n\n\nMcAlpine Creek Park and integrated McAlpine Creek Greenway constructed in 1978 was the first greenway built in the western piedmont of North Carolina.[126][127]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nLike much of the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cfa*), with four distinct seasons; the city itself is part of USDA hardiness zone 8a, transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south.[128] The following narrative reflects 1991-2020 climate data. Winters are short and fairly mild, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 42.1\u00a0\u00b0F (5.6\u00a0\u00b0C). On occasion the temperature can fall below 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22126.7\u00a0\u00b0C) but Charlotte also enjoys multiple warm winter days in excess of 65\u00a0\u00b0F (18.3\u00a0\u00b0C).[129] On average, there are 59 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 1.5 days that fail to rise above freezing.[129] Precipitation is evenly distributed through the year; only August stands out as a slightly wetter month, averaging 4.35 inches of rainfall. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.1\u00a0\u00b0F (26.7\u00a0\u00b0C).[130] Hot and humid days can arrive as early as May and last through the end of September. There is an average of 44 days per year with highs at or above 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C).[129] Official record temperatures range from 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C) recorded six times, most recently from June 29 to July 1, 2012, down to \u22125\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C) recorded on January 21, 1985, the most recent of three occasions. The record cold daily maximum is 14\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 12 and 13, 1899,[129] and the record warm daily minimum is 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) on August 13, 1881.[a] The average window for freezing temperatures is November 5 through March 30, allowing a growing season of 220 days.[129]\n\n\nCharlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny days; precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring.[129] On average, Charlotte receives 43.60 inches (1,110\u00a0mm) of precipitation annually, evenly distributed throughout the year. Annual precipitation has historically ranged from 26.23\u00a0in (666\u00a0mm) in 2001 to 68.44\u00a0in (1,738\u00a0mm) in 1884.[129] There is an average of 3.5 inches (8.9\u00a0cm) of snow, mainly in January and February and rarely December or March, with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain; seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts in 2011\u201312 to 22.6\u00a0in (57\u00a0cm) in 1959\u201360.[129] Snow and ice storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous. Snow has been recorded a small number of times in April, most recently, April 2, 2019.[131][132]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the Charlotte metropolitan area as a whole is noted for having one of the worst weather radar gaps among any major U.S. East Coast city, with little to no coverage in a roughly quadrilateral area spanning Concord, Salisbury and much \nof Statesville.[133] As the nearest NWS-owned NEXRAD is located in Greer, South Carolina, more than 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) to the west-southwest of Charlotte, this deficit is particularly problematic during severe thunderstorm or tornado episodes.[133] The current lowest angle of the radar, based in Greer, is quite far above the surface over Charlotte, so the velocities measurement for detecting rotations cannot be below mid-level in potential tornado-forming storms and thus cannot indicate whether said rotation extends closer to the ground (below 5,000\u00a0ft (1,500\u00a0m)).[133]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for

On August 18, 2012, Channel 14 News says that the initiative is \"... still a few years away\" and the plot of land is \"... just seven miles from the center of uptown\". According to the news channel, \"... the zoo will cost roughly $300 million, and will be completely privately-funded.\"[321] The Charlotte Observer references two other zoos, the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden and the North Carolina Zoological Park as two \"great zoos\" that are accessible from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area, both roughly more than 70 miles away.[322]\n\n\nCharlotte is also served by the Sea Life Charlotte-Concord Aquarium in the nearby city of Concord. The aquarium is 30,000 square feet in size, and is part of the Concord Mills mall. The aquarium opened on February 20, 2014.[323][324]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ImaginOn Children's Theater and Library\nThe Charlotte Mecklenburg Library serves the Charlotte area with a large collection (more than 1.5\u00a0million) of books, CDs and DVDs at 15\u00a0locations in the city of Charlotte, with branches in the surrounding towns of Matthews, Mint Hill, Huntersville, Cornelius and Davidson. All locations provide free access to Internet-enabled computers and WiFi, and a library card from one location is accepted at all 20 locations.[325]\n\n\nAlthough the library's roots go back to the *Charlotte Literary and Library Association,* founded on January 16, 1891,[326] the state-chartered Carnegie Library, which opened on the current North Tryon site of the Main Library, was the first non-subscription library opened to members of the public in the city of Charlotte. The philanthropist Andrew Carnegie donated $25,000 for a library building, on the condition that the city of Charlotte donate a site and $2,500 per year for books and salaries,[327] and that the state grant a charter for the library. All conditions were met, and the Charlotte Carnegie Library opened in an imposing classical building on July 2, 1903.\n\n\nThe 1903 state charter also required that a library be opened for the disenfranchised African-American population of Charlotte. This was completed in 1905 with the opening of the *Brevard Street Library for Negroes*, an independent library in Brooklyn, a historically black area of Charlotte, on the corner of Brevard and East Second Streets (now Martin Luther King Boulevard).[328] The Brevard Street Library was the first library for African Americans in the state of North Carolina,[328] and some sources say in the southeast.[329] The library was closed in 1961 when the Brooklyn neighborhood in Second Ward was redeveloped, but its role as a cultural center for African-Americans in Charlotte is continued by the Beatties Ford and West Boulevard branches of the library system, as well as by Charlotte's African-American Cultural Center.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Charlotte, North Carolina\n\n![](image)Spectrum Center, home of the Charlotte Hornets\n![](image)Truist Field, home of the Charlotte Knights\nCharlotte is home to three major professional sports franchises: the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL), the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and Charlotte FC of Major League Soccer (MLS).[330][331][332] The Panthers have been located in Charlotte since the team's creation in 1995, and the current Hornets franchise has been located in Charlotte since its creation in 1988 (with the exception of the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons).[333] The Panthers and Charlotte FC play their home games in Bank of America Stadium, while the Hornets play in the Spectrum Center.[334] The Panthers have won six division titles from (1996, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, 2015) and two NFC championships in 2003 and 2015.[335] Carolina has reached the Super Bowl twice but has been unsuccessful in both losing to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 and against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 in 2016.[336] The original Hornets NBA franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team,[337] but it relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana in 2002 after animosity grew between the team's fans and principal owner George Shinn.[338] The NBA quickly granted Charlotte an expansion franchise following the departure of the Hornets and the new franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, began to play in 2004.[339][340] The team retook the Hornets name when the New Orleans-based team renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans in 2013.[341] The name change became official on May 20, 2014.[342] On the same day, the franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988\u20132002 Hornets.[343] MLS awarded its expansion team to Charlotte in 2019, which began play as Charlotte FC in 2022.[344][345][346]\n\n\nCharlotte is represented in professional ice hockey by the Charlotte Checkers and in professional baseball at the Triple-A level by the Charlotte Knights.[347][348] Since 1999, the Knights has been the Triple-A Affiliate of the Chicago White Sox.[349][350]\n\n\nThe Charlotte Independence are a minor professional soccer club who play in USL League One the third tier of US professional soccer.[351] The Independence play their home matches at American Legion Memorial Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | Sport\n | Founded\n | League\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Carolina Panthers | Football | 1995\n | National Football League | Bank of America Stadium |\n| Charlotte Hornets | Basketball | 1988\n | National Basketball Association | Spectrum Center |\n| Charlotte FC | Soccer | 2022\n | Major League Soccer | Bank of America Stadium |\n| Charlotte Checkers | Ice hockey | 2010\n | American Hockey League | Bojangles Coliseum |\n| Charlotte Knights | Baseball | 1976\n | International League | Truist Field |\n| Charlotte Independence | Soccer | 2015\n | USL League One | American Legion Memorial Stadium |\n| Charlotte Eagles | Soccer | 1991\n | USL League Two | Sportsplex at Matthews |\n| Charlotte Lady Eagles | Soccer | 2000\n | W-League | Sportsplex at Matthews |\n\n\nThe city is also the home of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) headquarters.

Smith University participates at the NCAA Division II level. Johnson and Wales University participate in the USCAA.[375]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina and City Council of Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nCharlotte has a council-manager form of government. The mayor and city council are elected every two years, with no term limits. The mayor is *ex\u00a0officio* chair of the City Council, and only votes in case of a tie. Unlike other mayors in council-manager systems, Charlotte's mayor has the power to veto ordinances passed by the council; the council can override a mayoral veto by a vote of seven of its ten members.[376] The Council appoints a city manager to serve as chief administrative officer.[377]\n\n\nUnlike some other cities and towns in North Carolina, elections are held on a partisan basis. Vi Lyles, a Democrat elected in 2017, became the 59th mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. She is in her second term.[378]\n\n\nPatrick Cannon, a Democrat, was sworn in as mayor on December 2, 2013.[379] On March 26, 2014, Cannon was arrested on public corruption charges. Later the same day, he resigned as mayor.[380] Mayor Pro Tem Michael Barnes served as Acting Mayor until April 7, when the City Council selected State Senator Dan Clodfelter, also a Democrat, to serve the remainder of Cannon's term.[381] Former Mecklenburg County Commission chairwoman Jennifer Roberts defeated Clodfelter in the 2015 Democratic primary and went on to win the general election, becoming the first Democratic woman to be elected to the post.[382] She was ousted in the 2017 Democratic primary by Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, who later defeated Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith in the general election to become Mayor of Charlotte.[383]\n\n\nHistorically, voters have been friendly to moderates of both parties. However, in recent years, Charlotte has swung heavily to the Democrats. Republican strength is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the city, while Democratic strength is concentrated in the south-central, eastern, and northern areas.[384] The city had a Republican mayor from 1987 to 2009.[385][386][387]\n\n\nThe city council has 11 members (7 from districts and 4 at-large). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all 4 of the at-large seats in the November 2013, 2015, and 2017 municipal elections. While the City Council is responsible for passing ordinances, the city's budget, and other policies, all decisions can be overridden by the North Carolina General Assembly, since North Carolina municipalities do not have home rule. While municipal powers have been broadly construed since the 1960s, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local matters.[388]\n\n\nCharlotte is split between two congressional districts on the federal level. The northern half of the city is in the 12th district, represented by Democrat Alma Adams. The southern half is in the 14th district, represented by Democrat Jeff Jackson.[389] Charlotte is represented by ten members of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Mary Gardner Belk (D-88th), Terry M. Brown Jr. (D-92nd), Nasif Majeed (D-99th), John Autry (D-100th), Carolyn Logan (D-101st), Becky Carney (D-102nd), Brandon Lofton (D-104th), Wesley Harris (D-105th), Carla Cunningham (D-106th), and Kelly Alexander (D-107th), and six members of the North Carolina Senate, Mujtaba A. Mohammed (D-38th), DeAndrea Salvador (D-39th), Joyce Waddell (D-40th), Rachel Hunt (D-42nd), Vickie Sawyer (R-37th), and Natasha Marcus (D-41st).[390]\n\n\nCharlotte was selected in 2011 to host the 2012 Democratic National Convention, which was held at the Spectrum Center.[391] It began September 4, 2012, and ended on September 6, 2012. [1] In 2018, Charlotte was chosen to host the Republican National Convention in August 2020.[392]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of schools in Charlotte, North Carolina\n\n### School system[edit]\n\n\nThe city's public school system, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, is the second largest in North Carolina and 17th largest in the nation.[393][394] In 2009, it won the NAEP Awards, the Nation's Report Card for urban school systems with top honors among 18 city systems for fourth grade math, second place among eighth\u00a0graders.[395][396] An estimated 144,000 students are taught in 164 separate elementary, middle, and high schools.[397] Charlotte is also home to many private and independent schools, including British School of Charlotte,[398] Charlotte Catholic High School,[399] Charlotte Christian School,[400] Charlotte Country Day School,[401] Charlotte Islamic Academy,[402] Charlotte Latin School,[403] Grace Academy,[404] Providence Day School,[405] Hickory Grove Christian School,[406] Northside Christian Academy,[407] Southlake Christian Academy,[408] and United Faith Christian Academy.[409][410]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Student Union Quad of UNC Charlotte's main campus\nCharlotte is home to a number of universities and colleges such as Central Piedmont Community College, Johnson C.

Additionally, Union Presbyterian Seminary has a non-residential campus offering the Master of Arts in Christian Education, and the Master of Divinity in Charlotte near the Beverley Woods area.[432]\n\n\nThe North Carolina Research Campus, a 350-acre biotechnology hub located northeast of Charlotte in the city of Kannapolis, is a public-private venture including eight universities, one community college, the David H. Murdock Research Institute (DHMRI), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and corporate entities that collaborate to advance the fields of human health, nutrition and agriculture.

Part of Central Florida, it is the center of the Orlando metropolitan area, which had a population of 2,509,831 in 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States and the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida behind Miami and Tampa Bay. Orlando had a city population of 307,573 in the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Florida behind Jacksonville, Miami, and Tampa. It is the state's most populous inland city.\n\n\nOrlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due to tourism, major events, and convention traffic. It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles with over 4.4 million visitors as of 2019.[3] Orlando International Airport is the 13th-busiest airport in the United States and the 29th-busiest in the world.[4] The two largest and most internationally renowned tourist attractions in the Orlando area are the Walt Disney World Resort, opened by the Walt Disney Company in 1971 and located about 21 miles (34\u00a0km) southwest of downtown Orlando in Bay Lake, and the Universal Orlando Resort, opened in 1990 as a major expansion of Universal Studios Florida and the only theme park inside Orlando city limits.\n\n\nWith the exception of the theme parks, most major cultural sites like the Orlando Museum of Art and Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and world-renowned nightlife, bars and clubs are located in Downtown Orlando. Other attractions like The Wheel at ICON Park are located along International Drive. The city is also one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions; Orange County Convention Center is the second-largest convention facility in the United States.\n\n\nLike other major cities in the Sun Belt, Orlando grew rapidly from the 1960s into the first decade of the 21st century. Orlando is home to the University of Central Florida, which became the largest university campus in the United States in terms of enrollment as of 2015.[*needs update*] In 2010, Orlando was listed as a \"Gamma+\" level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFort Gatlin, as the Orlando area was once known, was established at what is now just south of the city limits by the 4th U.S. Artillery under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander C. W. Fanning on November 9, 1838, during the construction of a series of fortified encampments across Florida during the Second Seminole War.[6] The fort and surrounding area were named for John S. Gatlin, an Army physician who was killed in Dade's Massacre on December 28, 1835. The site of construction for Fort Gatlin, a defensible position with fresh water between three small lakes, was likely chosen because the location was on a main trail and is less than 250 yards from a nearby Council Oak tree, where Native Americans had traditionally met. King Phillip and Coacoochee frequented this area and the tree was alleged to be the place where the previous 1835 ambush that had killed over 100 soldiers had been planned.[7] When the U.S. military abandoned the fort in 1839, the surrounding community was built up by settlers.[6]\n\n\nPrior to being known by its current name, Orlando was once known as Jernigan. This name originates from the first European permanent settlers, Issac and Aaron Jernigan, cattlemen who moved from the state of Georgia and acquired land 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Gatlin along the west end of Lake Holden in July 1843 by the terms of the Armed Occupation Act.[8][9] Aaron Jernigan became Orange County's first state representative in 1845, but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered.\n\n\nFort Gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during October and November 1849, and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement.[9] A historical marker indicates that by 1850, the Jernigan homestead (or Fort Gatlin in some sources)[10] served as the nucleus of a village named Jernigan.[11] According to an account written years later by his daughter, at that time, about 80 settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in \"a stockade that Aaron Jernigan built on the north side of Lake Conway\". One of the county's first records, a grand jury's report, mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were \"driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in hasty defences [sic].\" Aaron Jernigan led a local volunteer militia during 1852.[9]\n\n\nA post office opened at Jernigan in 1850. Jernigan appears on an 1855 map of Florida, and by 1856, the area had become the county seat of Orange County.[12][6] In 1857, the post office was removed from Jernigan, and opened under the name of Orlando at a new location in present-day downtown Orlando.[9] During the American Civil War, the post office closed, but reopened in 1866. The move is believed to be sparked, in part, by Aaron Jernigan's fall from grace after he was relieved of his militia command by military officials in 1856. His behavior was so notorious that United States Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote, \"It is said they [Jernigan's militia] are more dreadful than the Indians.\"[13] In 1859, Jernigan and his sons were accused of committing a murder at the town's post office. They were then transported to Ocala, but escaped.[11]\n\n\nAt a meeting in 1857, debate had grown concerning the name of the town. Pioneer William B. Hull recalled how James Speer (a local resident, and prominent figure in the stories behind the naming of Orlando) rose in the heat of the argument and said, \"This place is often spoken of as 'Orlando's Grave.' Let's drop the word 'grave' and let the county seat be Orlando.\"[10][13]\n\n\nThe origin of the name is unknown but at least five stories relate how Orlando got its name. The most common stories are that the name Orlando originated from the tale of a man who died in 1835 during an attack by Native Americans in the area during the Second Seminole War. Several of the stories relay an oral history of the marker for a person named Orlando, and the *double entendre*, \"Here lies Orlando.\" One variant includes a man named Orlando who was passing by on his way to Tampa with a herd of oxen, died, and was buried in a marked grave.[14]\n\n\nThrough a retelling of history, a marker of some sort was believed to have been found by one of the original pioneers, but Speer's family has since claimed that Speer simply used the Orlando Reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the Shakespearean character from *As You Like It*, his favorite play.[10] This has become the most common accepted version of how Orlando got its name.\n\n\n\n### Orlando Reeves[edit]\n\n\nHistorians agree that likely no soldier was named Orlando Reeves.[15] Folklore is that Reeves was acting as a sentinel for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of Sandy Beach Lake.[16] Several different lakes are mentioned in the various versions, as no soldiers were in what is now downtown during 1835.[17]\n\n\nThe legend grew throughout the early 1900s, particularly with local historian Olive Brumbaugh (or Kena Fries[16][*verification needed*]) retelling in various writings and on local radio station WDBO in 1929.[10] Another historian, Eldon H. Gore, promoted the Reeves legend in *History of Orlando* published in 1949.[10] A memorial beside Lake Eola \u2013 originally placed by students of Orlando's Cherokee Junior School in 1939 and updated in 1990 \u2013 designates the spot where the city's supposed namesake fell.[15][16]\n\n\nConflicting legends exist. One legend has Reeves killed during an extended battle with the Seminoles after being field promoted after his platoon commander fell.[10] An in-depth review of military records in the 1970s and 1980s, though, turned up no record of Orlando Reeves ever existing.[10][15][16] Some versions attempt to account for Reeves having no military records by using the name of other people named Orlando that exist in some written records \u2013 Orlando Acosta; however, not much is known about Acosta or whether he even existed. Another version of the story has Orlando Reed, supposedly an Englishman and mail carrier between Fort Gatlin and Fort Mellon, allegedly killed while camping with his friends near Fort Gatlin.[10]\n\n\nA second variation also places the story in 1835 during the Second Seminole War. This name is taken from a South Carolinian cattle rancher named Orlando Savage Rees. Rees owned a Volusia County sugar mill and plantation, as well as several large estates in Florida and Mississippi.[10] Rees' sugar farms in the area were burned out in the Seminole attacks of 1835 (the year Orlando Reeves supposedly died). Subsequently, Rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle. In 1837, Rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the Seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops.[13]\n\n\nRees could have left a pine-bough marker with his name next to the trail; later residents misread \"Rees\" as \"Reeves\" and also mistook it as a grave maker.[13] In subsequent years, this story has merged with the Orlando Reeves story (which may have originally incorporated part of Dr. Gatlin's story).[10]\n\n\nOn two separate occasions, relatives of Rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city. F. K. Bull of South Carolina (Rees' great-grandson) told an Orlando reporter of a story in 1955; years later, Charles M. Bull Jr., of Orlando (Rees' great-great-grandson) offered local historians similar information.[13] Unlike Orlando Reeves, who cannot be traced to any historical record, the record is considerable that Orlando Rees did exist and was in Florida during that time. For example, in 1832, John James Audubon met with Rees in his large estate at Spring Garden, about 45 minutes from Orlando.[13]\n\n\n\n### Orlando (*As You Like It*)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Lucerne, c. 1905\nThe final variation has the city named after the protagonist in the Shakespeare play *As You Like It*.[10]\n\n\nIn 1975, Judge Donald A. Cheney put forth a new version of the story in an *Orlando Sentinel* article.[13] Cheney (a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission[18]) recounted a story told to him by his father, Judge John Moses Cheney (a major figure in Orlando's history, who arrived in Orlando in 1885).\n\n\nThe elder Cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time, James Speer, proposed the name Orlando after the character in *As You Like It*.[10] According to Cheney, Speer, \"was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of William Shakespeare ...\"[13] Quoting a letter that Speer wrote, \"Orlando was a veritable Forest of Arden, the locale of *As You Like It*.\"[19] Speer's descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow.[13]\n\n\nThis account also has some validity in that, as mentioned above, Speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from Jernigan to Orlando, though he may have used the Orlando Reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the Shakespearean character. According to yet another version of the story, Orlando may have been the name of one of his employees.[10][14] One of downtown Orlando's major streets is named Rosalind Avenue; Rosalind is the heroine of *As You Like It*, but this could also be a coincidence.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Orlando, Florida\n\n### Settlement[edit]\n\n\nIn 1823, the Treaty of Moultrie Creek created a Seminole reservation encompassing much of central Florida, including the area that would become Orlando. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized relocation of the Seminole from Florida to Oklahoma, leading to the Second Seminole War. In 1842, white settlement in the area was encouraged by the Armed Occupation Act. The first settler, Mr. Aaron Jernigan of Camden County, Georgia, arrived the following year and settled near Lake Holden.\n\n\n\n![](image)Historical Marker to Orlando's First Settler; Aaron Jernigan migrated to Lake Holden from Georgia in 1843.\n![](image)Mizell-Leu House (built 1888), a fine example of Florida Vernacular Style Architecture. The home is located in the Mizell-Leu House Historic District.\nMosquito County was renamed Orange County in 1845, with the county seat shortly thereafter relocated to Mellonville, a few miles west of Sanford. By 1856, settlement had begun in earnest in the interior of the county and a more centrally-located Courthouse was sought. The new town of Orlando, laid out in 1857,[6] consisted of four streets surrounding a courthouse square. The fledgling village suffered greatly during the Union blockade. The Reconstruction Era brought on a population explosion, resulting in the incorporation of the Town of Orlando on July 31, 1875, with 85 residents (22 voters). For a short time in 1879, the town revoked its charter, and was subsequently reincorporated.[20] Orlando was established as a city in 1885.[21]\n\n\nThe period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's citrus industry. The period ended with the Great Freeze of 1894\u201395, which forced many owners to give up their independent citrus groves, thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few \"citrus barons\", who shifted operations south, primarily around Lake Wales in Polk County.[14] The freeze caused many in Florida, including many Orlandoans, to move elsewhere, mostly to the North, California, or the Caribbean.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Wyoming Hotel, c. 1905\nNotable homesteaders in the area included the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the Econlockhatchee River, which travelers crossed by fording. This was commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the Orlando International Airport in the Boggy Creek area are 150 acres (0.61\u00a0km2) of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from southbound flights out of Orlando International Airport immediately on the south side of SR 417.\n\n\n\n### Post-Industrial Revolution[edit]\n\n\nOrlando became a popular resort during the years between the Spanish\u2013American War and World War I. In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the Florida Land Boom, causing land prices to soar. During this period, dozens of neighborhoods in the vicinity of downtown were constructed. The boom ended when several hurricanes hit Florida in the late 1920s, along with the Great Depression.\n\n\nDuring World War II, a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956, the aerospace and defense company Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the United States Air Force in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as air force bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base after Colonel Michael N. W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a B-47 Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the Strategic Air Command, operating B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by EC-121 and U-2 aircraft.\n\n\nIn 1968, Orlando AFB was transferred to the United States Navy and became Naval Training Center Orlando. In addition to boot camp facilities, the NTC Orlando was home of one of two Navy Nuclear Power Schools, and home of the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division. When McCoy AFB closed in 1976, its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become Orlando International Airport, while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the Navy as McCoy NTC Annex. That closed in 1995, and became a housing, though the former McCoy AFB still hosts a Navy Exchange, as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service. NTC Orlando was completely closed by the end of 1999 by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, and converted into the Baldwin Park neighborhood. The Naval Air Warfare Center had moved to Central Florida Research Park near UCF in 1989.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lucerne Circle, c. 1905\n### Tourism in history[edit]\n\n\nPerhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World. Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and Tampa for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes \u2013 Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses Orange, Seminole, Osceola, and Lake Counties. As a result, tourism became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.[22]\n\n\nAnother major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present-day Orlando International Airport, was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines (Delta Air Lines, National Airlines, Eastern Airlines, and Southern Airways) were providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO).\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of downtown Orlando (center) and periphery to Lake Apopka (upper-right); January 2011\nToday, the historic core of \"Old Orlando\" resides in downtown Orlando along Church Street, between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue.\nThe urban development and the central business district of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history. The present-day historic district is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around Lake Eola but stretches west across the city to Lake Lorna Dune and north into the College Park Neighborhood where you can find century-old oaks line brick streets. These neighborhoods include the \"Downtown Business District,\" \"North Quarter,\" \"Parramore,\" \"Callahan,\" \"South Eola Heights, \"Lake Eola Heights,\"Thornton Park\" and \"College Park\", and contain some of the oldest homes in Orlando.\n\n\n\n#### 2016 mass shooting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orlando nightclub shooting\n\nOn June 12, 2016, more than 100 people were shot at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Fifty (including the gunman) were killed and 60 were wounded. The gunman, whom the police SWAT team shot to death, was identified as 29-year-old Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, an American security guard. The act of terrorism was both the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history at the time and one of the deadliest mass shootings perpetrated by a single person in recorded world history. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during his unsuccessful negotiations with police.[23] After the shooting, the city held numerous vigils. In November 2016, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer announced the city's intention to acquire the Pulse Nightclub to build a permanent memorial for the 49 victims of the shooting. The city offered to buy it for $2.25\u00a0million, but the club's owner declined to sell.[24]\n\n\n\n## Geography and cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Eola in 1911\nThe geography of Orlando is mostly wetlands, consisting of many lakes and swamps. The terrain is generally flat, making the land fairly low and wet.[25] The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes, the largest of which is Lake Apopka. Central Florida's bedrock is mostly limestone and very porous; the Orlando area is susceptible to sinkholes. Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park, a city immediately north of downtown Orlando, dubbed \"The Winter Park Sinkhole\".\n\n\n\nSee also: List of neighborhoods in Orlando, Florida\n\nThere are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits and many unincorporated communities. Orlando's city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits. Such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando. This also explains Orlando's relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population. The city and county are working together in an effort to \"round-out\" the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits.[26][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Skyscrapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of the Orlando skyline in 2010\nMetro Orlando has a total of 19 completed skyscrapers. The majority are located in downtown Orlando and the rest are located in the tourist district southwest of downtown.[27] Skyscrapers built in downtown Orlando have not exceeded 441\u00a0ft (134\u00a0m), since 1988, when the SunTrust Center was completed.[*citation needed*] The main reason for this is the Orlando Executive Airport, just under 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) from the city center, which does not allow buildings to exceed a certain height without approval from the FAA.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Downtown Orlando[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of tallest buildings in Orlando\n\n* 200 South Orange, 1988, 441\u00a0ft (134\u00a0m), formerly SunTrust Center it's the tallest skyscraper in Greater Orlando[29]\n* The Vue at Lake Eola, 2008, 426\u00a0ft (130\u00a0m)\n* Orange County Courthouse, 1997, 416\u00a0ft (127\u00a0m)\n* Bank of America Center, 1988, 409\u00a0ft (125\u00a0m)\n* 55 West on the Esplanade, 2009, 377\u00a0ft (115\u00a0m)\n* Solaire at the Plaza, 2006, 359\u00a0ft (109\u00a0m)\n* Church Street Plaza Tower 1, 2019, 315\u00a0ft (96 m)\n* Dynetech Center, 2009, 357\u00a0ft (109\u00a0m)\n* Regions Bank Tower, 1986, 292\u00a0ft (89\u00a0m)\n* Premiere Trade Plaza Office Tower II 2006, 277\u00a0ft (84 m)\n* Citrus Center, 1971, 281\u00a0ft (85 m)\n* Citi Tower, 2017, 275\u00a0ft (83 m)\n* SkyHouse Orlando, 2013, 262\u00a0ft (80 m)\n* Modera Central, 2018, 260\u00a0ft (76 m)\n* The Waverly on Lake Eola, 2001, 280\u00a0ft (85 m)\n\n\n#### Outside downtown Orlando[edit]\n\n\n* Hyatt Regency Orlando, 2010, 428\u00a0ft (130\u00a0m)\n* SeaWorld SkyTower, 400\u00a0ft (122\u00a0m)\n* The Wheel at ICON Park, 2015, 400\u00a0ft (122\u00a0m)\n* Orlando International Airport's ATC tower, 2002, 346\u00a0ft (105\u00a0m)\n* StarFlyer Orlando on International Drive, 2018, 450\u00a0ft (137\u00a0m)\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rainy season in the city\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Orlando has a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) like much of the deep Southern United States. The two basic seasons in Orlando are a hot and rainy season, lasting from May until late October (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season), and a warm and dry season from November through April.[30] The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation, its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer, and its location in the center of a peninsula. Many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the Gulf Stream, which flows around the peninsula of Florida.\n\n\nDuring the height of Orlando's humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the low 90s \u00b0F (32\u201334\u00a0\u00b0C), while low temperatures rarely fall below the low 70s \u00b0F (22\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C). The average window for 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) temperatures is April 9 to October 14. The area's humidity acts as a buffer, usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C), but also pushing the heat index to over 110\u00a0\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C). The city's highest recorded temperature is 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C), set on September 8, 1921. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular lightning and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as rare damaging hail.[31]\n\n\nDuring the winter, humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is 60.6\u00a0\u00b0F (15.9\u00a0\u00b0C). Temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only 1.6 nights per year and the lowest recorded temperature is 18\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22128\u00a0\u00b0C), set on December 28, 1894. The annual mean minimum is just above 30\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121\u00a0\u00b0C) putting Orlando in hardiness zone 10a. Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare. The only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since record keeping began was in 1948, although some accumulation occurred in surrounding areas in a snow event in January 1977 that reached Miami. Flurries have also been observed in 1989, 2006,[32] and 2010.[33]\n\n\nThe average annual rainfall in Orlando is 51.45 inches (1,307\u00a0mm), a majority of which occurs in the period from June to September. October through May are Orlando's dry season. During this period (especially in its later months), often a wildfire hazard exists. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, a strong El Ni\u00f1o caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air-quality alerts in Orlando and severely affected normal daily life, including the postponement of that year's Pepsi 400 NASCAR race in nearby Daytona Beach.[34]\n\n\nOrlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk, although it is not as high as in South Florida's urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located 42 miles (68\u00a0km) inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles (124\u00a0km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico,[a] hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 feet (30\u00a0m) above mean sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious 2004 hurricane season, Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with Hurricane Charley the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during Hurricane Donna in 1960.[35]\n\n\nTornadoes are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the humid summer. They are more common during the infrequent cold days of winter, as well as in passing hurricanes. The two worst major outbreaks in the area's history, a 1998 outbreak that killed 42 people and a 2007 outbreak that killed 21, both happened in February.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Orlando (Orlando International Airport), Florida (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1892\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 88(31)\n | 90(32)\n | 97(36)\n | 99(37)\n | 102(39)\n | 101(38)\n | 101(38)\n | 101(38)\n | 103(39)\n | 98(37)\n | 93(34)\n | 91(33)\n | 103(39)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 83.5(28.6)\n | 85.5(29.7)\n | 88.4(31.3)\n | 91.1(32.8)\n | 94.5(34.7)\n | 96.1(35.6)\n | 96.1(35.6)\n | 95.4(35.2)\n | 93.8(34.3)\n | 91.0(32.8)\n | 86.7(30.4)\n | 83.7(28.7)\n | 97.2(36.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 74.9(23.8)\n | 78.9(26.1)\n | 83.6(28.7)\n | 88.4(31.3)\n | 90.8(32.7)\n | 92.0(33.3)\n | 91.6(33.1)\n | 89.6(32.0)\n | 84.7(29.3)\n | 78.3(25.7)\n | 73.8(23.2)\n | 83.2(28.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 60.6(15.9)\n | 63.6(17.6)\n | 67.3(19.6)\n | 72.2(22.3)\n | 77.3(25.2)\n | 81.2(27.3)\n | 82.6(28.1)\n | 82.6(28.1)\n | 81.0(27.2)\n | 75.5(24.2)\n | 68.2(20.1)\n | 63.3(17.4)\n | 73.0(22.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 49.5(9.7)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 55.8(13.2)\n | 60.7(15.9)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 71.6(22.0)\n | 73.2(22.9)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 72.4(22.4)\n | 66.2(19.0)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 52.9(11.6)\n | 62.7(17.1)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 33.2(0.7)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 41.3(5.2)\n | 49.2(9.6)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 67.5(19.7)\n | 70.5(21.4)\n | 70.7(21.5)\n | 67.8(19.9)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 44.4(6.9)\n | 37.6(3.1)\n | 31.3(\u22120.4)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 19(\u22127)\n | 19(\u22127)\n | 25(\u22124)\n | 37(3)\n | 47(8)\n | 53(12)\n | 64(18)\n | 63(17)\n | 50(10)\n | 38(3)\n | 28(\u22122)\n | 18(\u22128)\n | 18(\u22128)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.48(63)\n | 2.04(52)\n | 3.03(77)\n | 2.58(66)\n | 4.02(102)\n | 8.05(204)\n | 7.46(189)\n | 7.69(195)\n | 6.37(162)\n | 3.46(88)\n | 1.79(45)\n | 2.48(63)\n | 51.45(1,307)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 7.0\n | 6.4\n | 6.8\n | 6.3\n | 8.4\n | 16.2\n | 17.1\n | 17.2\n | 14.2\n | 8.4\n | 6.0\n | 7.1\n | 121.1\n |\n| Source: NOAA[36][37] |\n\n## Neighborhoods and Suburbs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of neighborhoods in Orlando, Florida\n\n* Downtown Orlando\n* Winter Park, Florida\n* Celebration, Florida\n* Pine Hills, Florida\n* Windermere, Florida\n* Dr. Phillips, Florida\n* Hunter's Creek, Florida\n* Lake Nona\n* Parramore\n* Williamsburg, Florida\n* Lake Buena Vista, Florida\n\n\n![](image)Disney Springs, formerly known as Downtown Disney, in Lake Buena Vista\n* Bay Lake, Florida\n* Winter Garden, Florida\n* Four Corners, Florida\n* Altamonte Springs, Florida\n* Meadow Woods, Florida\n* Debary, Florida\n* MetroWest\n* College Park\n* Baldwin Park\n* Wedgefield\n* Avalon\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1890 | 2,856 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1900 | 2,481 | \u221213.1% |\n| 1910 | 3,894 | +57.0% |\n| 1920 | 9,282 | +138.4% |\n| 1930 | 27,330 | +194.4% |\n| 1940 | 36,736 | +34.4% |\n| 1950 | 52,367 | +42.5% |\n| 1960 | 88,135 | +68.3% |\n| 1970 | 99,006 | +12.3% |\n| 1980 | 128,251 | +29.5% |\n| 1990 | 164,693 | +28.4% |\n| 2000 | 185,951 | +12.9% |\n| 2010 | 238,300 | +28.2% |\n| 2020 | 307,573 | +29.1% |\n| 2022 | 316,081 | +2.8% |\n| Population 1890\u20132010[38][39]2018 Estimate[40][41]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[42] |\n\n\n### 2010 and 2020 census[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Orlando racial composition**  \n (Hispanics excluded from racial categories)  \n (*NH = Non-Hispanic*)  \n\n| Race\n | Pop 2010[43] | Pop 2020[44] | % 2010\n | % 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White (NH)\n | 98,533\n | 103,010\n | 41.35%\n | 33.49%\n |\n| Black or African American (NH)\n | 63,584\n | 70,183\n | 26.68%\n | 22.81%\n |\n| Native American or Alaska Native (NH)\n | 483\n | 446\n | 0.20%\n | 0.15%\n |\n| Asian (NH)\n | 8,756\n | 12,984\n | 3.67%\n | 4.22%\n |\n| Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian (NH)\n | 130\n | 177\n | 0.06%\n | 0.06%\n |\n| Some other race (NH)\n | 1,688\n | 3,908\n | 0.71%\n | 1.27%\n |\n| Two or more races/Multiracial (NH)\n | 4,643\n | 15,804\n | 1.95%\n | 5.14%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n | 60,483\n | 101,061\n | 25.38%\n | 32.86%\n |\n| **Total** | **238,300** | **307,573** | **100.00%** | **100.00%** |\n\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 307,573 people, 113,238 households, and 61,667 families residing in the city.[45]\n\n\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 238,300 people, 97,661 households, and 51,716 families residing in the city.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in Orlando, 2010 U.S. Census.

The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.[47]\n\n\nOrlando not only has the largest population of Puerto Ricans in Florida, but it is also home to the fastest-growing Puerto Rican community on the mainland US.[48] Between 1980 and 2010,[49] the overall Latino/Hispanic population in Orlando increased from 4.1 to 25.4%. In addition to Puerto Ricans, Cubans also have a large presence in the city.[50] Orlando also has a large and growing Brazilian population, and is a popular travel destination for many Brazilians. There are Brazilian restaurants and shops located on International Drive and, in addition to Spanish and English, Portuguese-language signs and information can be found throughout Orlando International Airport.\n\n\nA large Caribbean population is also present in Orlando, with a significant West Indian community (particularly Bahamians, Dominicans, Jamaicans, Guyanese people\u2014of both Indian and African descent\u2014and Trinidadian and Tobagonian populations) and an established Haitian community.[*citation needed*] Orlando has an active Jewish community, as well.[51][52]\n\n\nOrlando has a large LGBT+ population and is recognized as one of the most accepting and tolerant cities in the Southeast. As of 2015[update], around 4.1% of Orlando's population identify as LGBT+,[53] making Orlando the city with the 20th-highest percentage of LGBT residents in the country.[54] The city is host to Gay Days every June (a Pride Month event at Walt Disney World),[55] holds a huge Pride festival and parade every October (since 2005), and is home to Florida's first openly gay City Commissioner, Patty Sheehan.[56]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Census map\nAs of 2000, 75% of all residents speak English as their first language, while 16.60% speak Spanish, 1.9% speak Haitian Creole, 1.3% speak French, 0.99% speak Portuguese, and 0.5% of the population speak Arabic as their mother language. In total, 24% of the population 5 years and older speak a language other than English at home.[57]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey of 2006\u20132008, 69% of Orlando's residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Spanish-speakers represented 19.2% of Orlando's population. Speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 9% of the city's population. Those who spoke an Asian language made up 1% of the population, and speakers of other languages made up the remaining 0.6% of the populace.[58]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan statistical area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greater Orlando\n\nOrlando is the hub city of the **Orlando\u2013Kissimmee\u2013Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area**, colloquially known as \"**Greater Orlando**\" or \"**Metro Orlando**\". The area encompasses four counties (Lake, Orange, Osceola, and Seminole). As of 2020, the population of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was 2,673,376, making it the third largest in Florida and the 22nd-largest metro area in the United States.\n\n\nWhen Combined Statistical Areas (CSA) were instituted in 2000, Orlando was initially joined with The Villages, Florida, Micropolitan Statistical Area, to form the \"Orlando-The Villages, Florida, Combined Statistical Area\". In 2006, the metropolitan areas of Deltona (Volusia County) and Palm Coast (Flagler County) were added to create the \"Orlando-Deltona-Daytona Beach, Florida, Combined Statistical Area\".[59] As of 2020, the CSA has been renamed the **Orlando\u2013Lakeland\u2013Deltona, Florida Combined Statistical Area** and had the 15th highest population in the US, with a total of 4,197,095 people.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Florida companies and List of Orlando companies\n\n![](image)The North/South Concourse of the Orange County Convention Center\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nOrlando is a major industrial and hi-tech center. The metro area has a $13.4\u00a0billion technology industry employing 53,000 people;[*citation needed*] and is a nationally recognized cluster of innovation in digital media, agricultural technology, aviation, aerospace, and software design. More than 150 international companies, representing approximately 20 countries, have facilities in Metro Orlando.\n\n\nOrlando has the 7th-largest research park in the country, Central Florida Research Park, with over 1,025 acres (4.15\u00a0km2). It is home to over 120 companies, employs more than 8,500 people, and is the hub of the nation's military simulation and training programs. Near the end of each year, the Orange County Convention Center hosts the world's largest modeling and simulation conference: Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC). Metro Orlando is home to the simulation procurement commands for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.\n\n\nLockheed Martin has a large manufacturing facility for missile systems, aeronautical craft and related high-tech research. Other notable engineering firms have offices or labs in Metro Orlando: KDF, General Dynamics, Harris, Mitsubishi Power Systems, Siemens, Veritas/Symantec, multiple United States Air Force facilities, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Delta Connection Academy, Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University, General Electric, Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation, U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, United States Army Simulation and Training Technology Center, AT&T, Boeing, CAE Systems Flight and Simulation Training, Hewlett-Packard, Institute for Simulation and Training, National Center for Simulation, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. The Naval Training Center until a few years ago was one of the two places where nuclear engineers were trained for the United States Navy. Now the land has been converted into the Baldwin Park development. Numerous office complexes for large corporations have popped up along the Interstate 4 corridor north of Orlando, especially in Maitland, Lake Mary and Heathrow.\n\n\nOrlando is close enough to Patrick Space Force Base, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, and Kennedy Space Center for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs. It also allows easy access to Port Canaveral, a cruise ship terminal.\n\n\nOrlando is the home base of Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, and the largest operator of casual dining restaurants in the world by revenue. In September 2009 it moved to a new headquarters and central distribution facility.[60]\n\n\nFormer Darden Restaurants subsidiary Red Lobster is based in Downtown Orlando.\n\n\n\n### Film, television, and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nAnother important sector is the film, television, and electronic gaming industries, aided by the presence of Universal Studios, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Full Sail University, UCF College of Arts and Humanities, the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, and other entertainment companies and schools. The U.S. modeling, simulation, and training (MS&T) industry is centered on the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to University of Central Florida (UCF). Nearby Maitland is the home of Tiburon, a division of the video game company Electronic Arts. Tiburon Entertainment was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the Madden NFL series and NCAA Football series of video games. Nearby Full Sail University, located in Winter Park, draws new-media students in the areas of video game design, film, show production, and computer animation, among others, its graduates spawning several start-ups in these fields in the Orlando area. The headquarters of Ripley Entertainment Inc. are also located in Orlando.\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nOrlando has two non-profit hospital systems: Orlando Health and AdventHealth. Orlando Health's Orlando Regional Medical Center is home to Central Florida's only Level I trauma center, and Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies and AdventHealth Orlando have the area's only Level III neonatal intensive care units. Orlando's medical leadership was further advanced with the completion of University of Central Florida's College of Medicine, a new VA Hospital and the new Nemours Children's Hospital, which is located in a new medical district in the Lake Nona area of the city.[61]\n\n\n\n### Housing and employment[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, the unemployment rate in Greater Orlando was low, which resulted in growth that led to urban sprawl in the surrounding area and, in combination with the United States housing bubble, to a large increase in home prices. Metro Orlando's unemployment rate in June 2010 was 11.1 percent, was 11.4 percent in April 2010, and was about 10 percent in about the same time of year in 2009.[62] As of August 2013, the area's jobless rate was 6.6 percent.[63] Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 37.08% in one year, from a median of $182,300 in November 2004 to $249,900 in November 2005, and eventually peaked at $264,436 in July 2007. From there, with the economic meltdown, prices plummeted, with the median falling below $200,000 in September 2008, at one point falling at an annual rate of 39.27%. The median dipped below $100,000 in 2010 before stabilizing around $110,000 in 2011. As of April 2012, the median home price is $116,000.[64]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of amusement parks in Central Florida and List of Orlando, Florida attractions\n\n![](image)Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney World One of the main driving forces in Orlando's economy is its tourism industry and the city is one of the leading tourism destinations in the world. Nicknamed the 'Theme Park Capital of the World', the Orlando area is home to Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando, Legoland, and Fun Spot America Theme Parks. A record 75\u00a0million visitors came to the Orlando region in 2018, making it the top tourist destination in the United States.[65]\n\n\nThe Orlando area features 7 of the 10 most visited theme parks in North America (5 of the top 10 in the world), as well as the 4 most visited water parks in the U.S.[66] The Walt Disney World resort is the area's largest attraction with its many facets such as the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, and Disney Springs. Universal Orlando, like Walt Disney World, is a multi-faceted resort comprising Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, Volcano Bay, and Universal CityWalk. SeaWorld Orlando is a large park that features numerous zoological displays and marine animals alongside an amusement park with roller coasters like Mako, Manta, and Kraken. The property also comprises more than one park, alongside Aquatica water park and Discovery Cove. Fun Spot Orlando and Kissimmee are more typical amusement parks with big thrills in a small space with roller coasters like White Lightning and Freedom Flyer in Orlando and Mine Blower and Rockstar Coaster in Kissimmee. Orlando is also home to I-Drive 360 on International Drive home to The Wheel at ICON Park, Madame Tussauds, and Sealife Aquarium. Orlando attractions also appeal to many locals who want to enjoy themselves close to home.\n\n\nThe convention industry is also critical to the region's economy. The Orange County Convention Center, expanded in 2004 to over two million square feet (200,000 m2) of exhibition space, is now the second-largest convention complex in terms of space in the United States, trailing only McCormick Place in Chicago. The city vies with Chicago and Las Vegas for hosting the most convention attendees in the United States.[67]\n\n\n\n#### Golf[edit]\n\n\nNumerous golf courses can be found in the city, with the most famous[68] being Bay Hill Club and Lodge, home to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Orlando was known as \"Hollywood East\" because of numerous film production studios in the area, although such activity has slowed down considerably into the 2000s. Perhaps the most famous film-making moment in the city's history occurred with the implosion of Orlando's previous City Hall for the movie *Lethal Weapon 3*. The same year, Orlando native Wesley Snipes starred in the film *Passenger 57*, which was shot predominantly in his hometown. For the next decade, Orlando was production center for television shows, direct-to-video productions, and commercial production.[69] In 1997, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio in Disney's Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World. The feature animation studio produced the films *Mulan*, *Lilo & Stitch*, and the early stages of *Brother Bear*, but shutdown in 2004 due to the company's newfound focus on computer animation.[70] Universal Studios Florida's Soundstage 21 is home to TNA Wrestling's flagship show TNA Impact!. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 1990s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children,[*citation needed*] no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. In the 2000s\u20132020s, entertainment related operations have predominantly consolidated the city's tourism-related businesses \u2014 namely events, concerts, hotels, and trade shows.[71]\n\n\nThe Florida Film Festival, which takes place in venues throughout the area, is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. Orlando's indie film scene has been active since Haxan Film's *The Blair Witch Project* (1999) and a few years later with Charlize Theron winning her Academy Award for *Monster* (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the number of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.\n\n\n\n### Theater and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Metropolitan Area is home to a substantial theater population. Several professional and semi-professional houses and many community theaters include the Central Florida Ballet, Orlando Ballet, Orlando Shakespeare Theater, Orlando Repertory Theatre, and IceHouse Theatre in Mount Dora. Orlando Theatre Project, closed in 2009. Additionally, both University of Central Florida and Rollins College (Winter Park) are home to theater departments that attract an influx of young artists to the area.\n\n\nThe Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre had hosted national Broadway tours on a regular basis. This venue was built in 1926 and underwent a major renovation in 1974.[72] The Bob Carr has since closed due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and has yet to host a show since February 2020. While waiting on the completion of Phase II construction of the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, the newly designated Bob Carr Theater will continue to host non-Broadway events.[73]\n\n\nThe Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival, which draws touring companies from around the world, is hosted in various venues over Orlando's Loch Haven Park every spring. At the festival, there are also readings and fully staged productions of new and unknown plays by local artists.[74] Also in the spring, there is The Harriett Lake Festival of New Plays, hosted by Orlando Shakespeare Theater.[75] Founded in 2002, the Orlando Cabaret Festival showcases local, national, and internationally renowned cabaret artist to Mad Cow Theatre in Downtown Orlando each spring.[76]\n\n\nClassical Music and Music Theater are also represented. Orlando has two professional orchestras - the Orlando Symphony Orchestra, which was founded in 1991 when the Central Florida Friends of Music reorganized, and the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 1993, the second of which also serves as the orchestra for productions of Opera Orlando, which developed when the Florida Opera Theater, founded in 2009, reorganized in 2016.\n\n\n\n### Literary Arts[edit]\n\n\nThe indie literary presses Burrow Press and Autofocus are based in Orlando. There is also a large concentration of slam poets and poetry events in and around the metro area which has led to the city being dubbed Litlando. This name is fitting as legend goes that the city's name and Rosalind Avenue in downtown Orlando were taken from characters from the Shakespeare play \"As You Like It\" while Lake Ivanhoe was named after the namesake character from the 1820 book, Ivanhoe, by Walter Scott.\n\n\n\n### Music and local culture[edit]\n\n\nOrlando is home to numerous recording studios and producers, and as a result, contributed heavily to the boyband craze of the mid-1990s. The groups Backstreet Boys, NSync, and O-Town all started in Orlando before becoming nationwide successes. The alternative groups Matchbox Twenty, Seven Mary Three, and Alter Bridge are from Orlando, as is the Christian hip-hop act Group 1 Crew. Orlando also has a prominent metal scene, spawning bands such as Death and Trivium. There are also hip hop music, metal, rock music, reggaeton and Latino music scenes are all active within the city.\n\n\nA substantial amount of the teenage and young adult populations identify as being goth, emo, or punk.[77][*failed verification*] Orlando experienced its own Second Summer of Love between 1991 and 1992 that popularized the subculture surrounding electronic dance music in Florida.[78] The culture progressed as time went on, starting in 1995 from when alternative-rock band Matchbox Twenty, and pop bands NSync and Backstreet Boys originated.[79] Over the years, the intensity of the music increased. In the late 1990s, Skrape, a metal band, was established, shortly followed by the screamo band From First to Last as well as the alternative metal band Fireflight.[*citation needed*] In the early 2000s, the heavy metal bands Trivium and Mindscar formed.[*citation needed*] In the later 2000s, more screamo bands, such as Blood on the Dance Floor, Sleeping with Sirens, and Broadway were established.[80][*failed verification*] The Vans Warped Tour, a concert containing metalcore/screamo/punk bands, takes place in Orlando annually.[81][*failed verification*]\n\n\nAs a minor source of sprawling urban culture, some hip hop artists from Orlando have garnered mainstream attention and recognition and have signed to major labels, most notably Tyla Yaweh (signed to Epic Records), Hotboii (signed to Interscope Records) and 9lokkNine (signed to Cash Money Records). The highest charting song from an Orlando-based artist is YNW Melly and 9lokkNine's 2019 single \"223's\", which peaked at number 34 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 (9lokkNine featured on as a guest artist on its official release).[82][83]\n\n\nGaming YouTuber Dream is based in Orlando. He has accumulated 40 million combined subscribers and signed a recording deal with Republic Records in 2023.[84]\n\n\n\n### Shopping malls[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Florida Mall\n* **The Florida Mall** is the largest mall in Orlando and one of the largest single-story malls in the US at over 1.849\u00a0million square feet (171,800\u00a0m2). There are over 250 stores, seven anchor department stores, and the Florida Mall Hotel & Conference Center Tower. It is located outside the city proper in unincorporated Orange County.\n* **The Mall at Millenia** is a contemporary two-level upscale shopping mall, including the department stores of Bloomingdale's, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus.

IKEA Orlando opened adjacent to the mall on November 14, 2007.\n* **Orlando Fashion Square** is located on East Colonial Drive, near Downtown Orlando. Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE: SRG) is planning a late-summer 2017 completion of a major renovation that will welcome new shops and restaurants to the East Colonial Drive area.\n* **Orlando International Premium Outlets** is an outdoor outlet mall with over 180 stores.\n* **Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets** is an outdoor outlet mall with over 160 stores in the south of Orlando in proximity to Disney World.\n* **Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores** is a strip mall style open-air outlet center, that is located 2 miles from Walt Disney World near US-192.\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe films *Miami Connection*, *Ernest Saves Christmas*, *Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector*, *Never Back Down*, and *The Florida Project* take place in and were filmed entirely in Orlando. The novel *Paper Towns* takes place in the city, but the film adaptation was shot in North Carolina. Establishing shots were filmed around Orlando; notably in downtown and along Orange Blossom Trail. *Geostorm* has a scene where Orlando is destroyed by a lightning storm. However, those scenes were filmed in New Orleans. *Parenthood* was filmed entirely in Orlando, but takes place in St. Louis. *D.A.R.Y.L.* was partially filmed in Orlando; notably the climactic chase scene takes place in downtown Orlando along State Road 408 (East/West Expressway).[*citation needed*] Scenes were also filmed for *Transformers: Dark of the Moon* at the Orlando International Airport in early October 2010.[85] Orlando is also the city very prominently featured in the ABC sitcom *Fresh Off the Boat*. Though set in Louisiana, filming for *Passenger 57* took place in Wesley Snipes' hometown of Orlando, Florida, with Orlando-Sanford International Airport standing in for \"Lake Lucille\" airport.[86] The airport's former combination main hangar and control tower from its time as Naval Air Station Sanford was used for many key scenes just prior to its demolition after filming.[87] Various scenes from *Monster*, set in Daytona Beach, were also filmed in the Orlando, Winter Park, Florida and Kissimmee areas.[88]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Orlando, Florida\n\n\n\nProfessional sports teams\n| Club\n | Sport\n | League\n | Venue\n | Average attendance\n | Founded\n | Titles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Orlando Anarchy | Football\n | WFA | Trinity Preparatory School | \u2014\n | 2010\n | 1\n |\n| Orlando City SC | Soccer | MLS | Exploria Stadium | 20,404[89] | 2015\n | 1\n |\n| Orlando Magic | Basketball | NBA | Amway Center | 16,785\n | 1989\n | 0\n |\n| Orlando Predators | Indoor football\n | NAL | Amway Center | \u2014\n | 2019\n | 0\n |\n| Orlando Pride | Women's soccer | NWSL | Exploria Stadium | 4,837\n | 2016\n | 0\n |\n| Orlando Solar Bears[90] | Ice hockey | ECHL | Amway Center | 6,209\n | 2012\n | 0\n |\n| Orlando Guardians | American Football | XFL | Camping World Stadium | \u2014\n | 2022\n | 0\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Amway Center\nOrlando is the home city of two major league professional sports teams: the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer (MLS).\n\n\nOrlando has four minor league professional teams: the Orlando Solar Bears ECHL ice hockey team, the Orlando Predators of the National Arena League (NAL), the Orlando Guardians of the XFL, and the Orlando Anarchy of the Women's Football Alliance.\n\n\nThe original Orlando Solar Bears were part of the International Hockey League winning the last Turner Cup championship in 2001, before the league folded.

According to the suit, the city has paid $3.3\u00a0million since 2012 to people who have accused officers of excessive force.[98]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nFrom the mid-20th century to the early 21st century, Orlando was one of the most politically conservative cities in the United States, having voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election from 1948 to 2004. This streak was broken when Barack Obama won it in 2008, becoming the first Democrat to carry the city in a presidential election since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. It has since become a Democratic stronghold in statewide and local elections.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nPublic primary and secondary education is handled by Orange County Public Schools.

Heavy traffic is also common in the tourist district south of downtown. Rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7\u00a0am) and afternoons (after 4\u00a0pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including downloading the Tele-Traffic App (available for iPhone and Android), dialing 5-1-1 (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the Florida Department of Transportation, available by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called Variable-message signs, information is also provided by FDOT) on the major highways and roadways.\n\n\n\n#### Major highways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)I-4 eastbound approaching Downtown Orlando\n* ![](image) Interstate 4 is Orlando's primary interstate highway. Orlando is the second-largest city served by only one interstate, surpassed only by Austin, Texas, and is the largest metropolitan area in the US serviced by a single interstate. The interstate begins in Tampa, Florida, and travels northeast across the midsection of the state directly through Orlando, ending in Daytona Beach. As a key connector to Orlando's suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts, I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. I-4 is also known as State Road 400.\n* ![](image) East-West Expressway (Toll 408) is a major east\u2013west highway managed by the Central Florida Expressway Authority. The highway intersects with I-4 in Downtown Orlando, providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and western suburbs including the University of Central Florida and Waterford Lakes area. The highway also intersects with the Central Florida Greeneway (Toll 417) and Florida's Turnpike. By late 2006, the I-4/408 interchange had almost completed undergoing a major overhaul that creates multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic. The agency recently[*when?*] finished construction of lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers along the roadway, though much work remains to be done.\n* ![](image) Beachline Expressway (Toll 528) provides key access to the Orlando International Airport and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, specifically Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral.\n* ![](image) Central Florida Greeneway (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the Central Florida Expressway Authority and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the East-West Expressway (Toll 408), the Beachline Expressway (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4.\n* ![](image) Daniel Webster Western Beltway (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. It is managed jointly by the Florida Turnpike and the Central Florida Expressway Authority. The highway serves as a \"back entrance\" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern suburbs including Apopka via Florida's Turnpike.\n* ![](image) John Land Apopka Expressway (Toll 414) A new east to west tollway serving northern Orlando. Phase I opened on February 14, 2009, and extends from US 441 to State Road 429. Phase II opened on January 19, 2013, and links SR 429 to US 441 several miles west of the former SR 429 (now renamed State Road 451) intersection.\n* ![](image) Florida's Turnpike (Toll 91) is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and terminates in Miami.\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando area is served by one through railroad. The line, now known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor (CFRC), was previously known as the \"A\" line (formerly the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's main line). The line was purchased from CSX Transportation by the State of Florida in 2013 and is now used by SunRail, the Central Florida commuter rail system. Some freight spurs still exist off of the line, which are operated by the Florida Central Railroad. Amtrak passenger service runs along CFRC. See also a map of these railroads.\n\n\n\n![](image)Platform-side, Orlando Amtrak Station\nAmtrak intercity passenger rail service operates from the Orlando Amtrak Station south of downtown. The Mission Revival-style station has been in continuous use since 1927,[102] first for the Atlantic Coast Line, then the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (signage for which is still displayed over the station's main entrance). Amtrak's *Silver Meteor* and *Silver Star* service Orlando four times daily, twice bound for points north to New York City and twice bound for points south to Miami. Orlando also serves as a transfer hub for Amtrak Thruway bus service. Orlando Station has the highest Amtrak ridership in the state, with the exception of the *Auto Train* depot located in nearby Sanford.[103]\n\n\nHistorically, Orlando's other major railroad stations have included:\n\n\n\n* Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station (now Church Street Station, a commercial development)\n* Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station (Central Avenue Station; 1898\u20131955).\n\n\n#### Commuter rail[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMain article: SunRail\n\n![](image)A southbound SunRail train leaving Winter Park Station\nIn 2005, federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of SunRail, a local commuter rail service, to operate on the former CSX \"A\" line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between Downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. Federal and state funds covered approximately 80% of the estimated $400\u00a0million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007 and the line was originally projected to begin operations in 2011.[104] However, the project was ultimately voted down by Florida State Senate in 2008 and again in 2009 due to an amendment that would have approved a $200\u00a0million insurance policy for the system. Although there had been growing concern the system would be scrapped, a deadline extension combined with a new insurance arrangement with CSX brought new hope that SunRail will be completed after all.[105] In a special session in December 2009, the Florida Legislature approved commuter rail for Florida, which also enabled high-speed rail federal funding. SunRail began passenger service on May 1, 2014. Phase I of the rail system runs from DeBary to Sand Lake Road in South Orlando. Phase II, connects DeBary and continues north to DeLand, as well as extending from Sand Lake Road in Orlando south to Poinciana. Attempts to establish a smaller light rail service for the Orlando area were also considered at one time,[*when?*] but were also met with much resistance.\n\n\n\n#### Inter-city rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brightline\n\nA privately funded initiative known as *All Aboard Florida*, which would provide inter-city rail service from Miami to Orlando, was announced in March 2012.[106] Now known as Brightline, the train currently runs from Downtown Miami to the Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal. The Orlando extension includes 40 miles (64\u00a0km) of new railway track and top speeds reach 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), becoming one of the fastest rail services in the United States.[107] Service to Orlando began on September 22, 2023.[108] Future plans are underway to add a station near Disney Springs.[109]\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lynx bus on the Route 102 line in Orlando\nLynx provides local transit service covering a five-county area: Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Polk, and Volusia.[110][111] Lynx bus frequency varies depending on the route and time of day.\n\n\nGreyhound Lines offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.\n\n\nHaving a very well-developed tourism industry and millions of visitors per year the City of Orlando has multiple options for groups arriving and touring the city and surrounding areas by local charter bus companies.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nOrlando is served by a collection of independently owned taxi companies. In downtown Orlando, taxis can be hailed on a regular basis. Taxis are also available in and around the Amway Center, Orlando Convention Center, and all major attractions/theme parks. Orlando also has service from car-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft, which offer service at all airports.\n\n\n\n### Airport shuttles[edit]\n\n\nTransportation between the Orlando International Airport and various locations in and around Orlando is provided by airport shuttle services. Several shuttles operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of sister cities in Florida\n\nOrlando's sister cities are:[112]\n\n\n\n* Curitiba, Brazil\n* Guilin, China\n* Monterrey, Mexico\n* Seine-et-Marne, France\n* Tainan, Taiwan\n* Urayasu, Japan\n* Valladolid, Spain\n\n\n### Foreign consulates[edit]\n\n\nGiven Orlando's status as a busy international tourist destination and growing industrial and commercial base, there are several foreign consulates and honorary consulates in Orlando including (as of April 2023): Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Haiti, Iceland (Honorary), Italy (Honorary), Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Switzerland (Honorary).[113] In 1999, Orlando had the second-highest number of foreign consulates in Florida next to Miami.[114]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of people from Orlando, Florida\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Distance measured from Orlando City Hall to nearest Atlantic coastline, near Oak Hill, Brevard County, and nearest Gulf coastline, near, Pine Island, Hernando County, using Google Earth's Ruler tool.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** U.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Orlando, Florida\n2. **^** \"2020 U.S. Gazetteer Files\".

The 2020 census shows 35,580 residents.\n\n\nSalisbury is the oldest continually populated colonial town in the western region of North Carolina. It is noted for its historic preservation, with five Local Historic Districts and ten National Register Historic Districts.\n\n\nSoft drink producer Cheerwine and regional supermarket Food Lion are located in Salisbury and Rack Room Shoes was founded there.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Rowan County Courthouse in Salisbury, 1934\n![](image)Child laborer in Salisbury, 1908\nIn 1753 an appointed Anglo-European trustee for Rowan County was directed to enter 40 acres (16\u00a0ha) of land for a County Seat, and public buildings were erected. The deed is dated February 11, 1755, when John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville conveyed 635 acres (257\u00a0ha) for the \"Salisbury Township\".[7] The settlement was built at the intersection of longtime Native American trading routes. It became an economic hub along what was improved as the Great Wagon Road in North Carolina.[9] It became the principal city of the Salisbury judicial and militia districts in the years leading up to the American Revolutionary War.[7] On June 12, 1792, Salisbury was granted a US Post Office. Its first postmaster was George Lauman. This post office has been in continuous operation ever since.[10][11]\n\n\nIn the antebellum period and after the American Civil War, Salisbury was the trading city of an upland area devoted to cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop. It was also the business and law center of the county. Numerous houses and other structures were built by wealthy planters and merchants in this period. In the late 19th century, the city was served by railroads, becoming a railroad hub as people and freight were transported along the eastern corridor.\n\n\nAfter three black men were lynched in Salisbury in 1906, one of the lynchers was prosecuted. This resulted in the first conviction for lynching in North Carolina, and one of the first in the United States.[12]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Salisbury's economy grew into an industrial-based economy. Entrepreneurs developed the textile industry for processing cotton, first, and numerous textile mills operated in the city.[13]\n\n\nThe industry owners moved their jobs and mills offshore in the late 20th century, to areas with cheaper labor costs. This change cost the city and area many jobs, and unemployment rose for a period. Since 2000, the city's population has grown rapidly, with people attracted to the city's resources and amenities.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2010, the city has a total area of 22.14 square miles (57.3\u00a0km2), all land.[14]\n\n\nSalisbury is located in the Central Piedmont of North Carolina in the Charlotte metropolitan area. The city is 21 miles north of Concord, 38 miles south of Winston-Salem, and 25 miles northeast of Charlotte.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %\u00b1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1850 | 1,086 |  | \u2014 |\n| 1860 | 2,420 |  | 122.8% |\n| 1880 | 2,723 |  | \u2014 |\n| 1890 | 4,418 |  | 62.2% |\n| 1900 | 6,277 |  | 42.1% |\n| 1910 | 7,153 |  | 14.0% |\n| 1920 | 13,884 |  | 94.1% |\n| 1930 | 16,951 |  | 22.1% |\n| 1940 | 19,037 |  | 12.3% |\n| 1950 | 20,102 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1960 | 21,297 |  | 5.9% |\n| 1970 | 22,515 |  | 5.7% |\n| 1980 | 22,677 |  | 0.7% |\n| 1990 | 23,087 |  | 1.8% |\n| 2000 | 26,462 |  | 14.6% |\n| 2010 | 33,662 |  | 27.2% |\n| 2020 | 35,540 |  | 5.6% |\n| 2021 (est.) | 35,760 | [15] | 0.6% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[16] |\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 35,540 people, 12,524 households, and 7,325 families residing in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalisbury racial composition[17]\n| Race\n | Number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| White (non-Hispanic)\n | 15,785\n | 44.41%\n |\n| Black or African American (non-Hispanic)\n | 12,689\n | 35.7%\n |\n| Native American | 105\n | 0.3%\n |\n| Asian | 499\n | 1.4%\n |\n| Pacific Islander | 22\n | 0.06%\n |\n| Other/Mixed | 1,380\n | 3.88%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 5,060\n | 14.24%\n |\n\n\n### 2010 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census[4] of 2010, there were 33,663 people, 10,276 households, and 6,186 families residing in the city.
