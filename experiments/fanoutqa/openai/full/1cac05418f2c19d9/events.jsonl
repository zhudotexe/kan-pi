India overtook China to become the most populous country at the end of April 2023.[7] As of the UN data released in April 2023,[8] India has surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation. According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late 19th century to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: \"There can be no serious, informed belief… that… late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation…\".[47]\n\n\n\n## Salient features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crude birth rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 people, national average)[48][49][50]\n![](image)Infant mortality rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)\nIndia occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population. At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[51] lived in about 638,000 villages[52] and the remaining 27.8%[51] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[53]\n\n\nIndia's population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[54] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both China and India by 2025.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Comparative demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nComparative demographics\n| Category\n | Global ranking\n | References\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Area\n

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870–930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east and southeast, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest.[b][15] Ethiopia covers a land area of 1,112,000 square kilometres (472,000 sq. miles).[16] As of 2023[update], it is home to around 126.5 million inhabitants, making it the 13th-most populous country in the world, the 2nd-most populous in Africa after Nigeria, and the most populated landlocked country on Earth.[17][18] The national capital and largest city, Addis Ababa, lies several kilometres west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the African and Somali tectonic plates.[19]\n\n\nAnatomically modern humans emerged from modern-day Ethiopia and set out for the Near East and elsewhere in the Middle Paleolithic period.[20][21][22][23][24] Southwestern Ethiopia has been proposed as a possible homeland of the Afroasiatic language family.[25] Ethiopia is Africa's oldest independent country and one of the oldest in the world.[26][27] In 980 BC, the Kingdom of D'mt extended its realm over Eritrea and the northern region of Ethiopia, while the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region for 900 years. Christianity was embraced by the kingdom in 330,[28] and Islam arrived by the first Hijra in 615.[29] After the collapse of Aksum in 960, a variety of kingdoms, largely tribal confederations, existed in the land of Ethiopia. The Zagwe dynasty ruled the north-central parts until being overthrown by Yekuno Amlak in 1270, inaugurating the Ethiopian Empire and the Solomonic dynasty, claimed descent from the biblical Solomon and Queen of Sheba under their son Menelik I. By the 14th century, the empire had grown in prestige through territorial expansion and fighting against adjacent territories; most notably, the Ethiopian–Adal War (1529–1543) contributed to fragmentation of the empire, which ultimately fell under a decentralization known as *Zemene Mesafint* in the mid-18th century. Emperor Tewodros II ended *Zemene Mesafint* at the beginning of his reign in 1855, marking the reunification and modernization of Ethiopia.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1878 onwards, Emperor Menelik II launched a series of conquests known as Menelik's Expansions, which resulted in the formation of Ethiopia's current border. Externally, during the late 19th century, Ethiopia defended itself against foreign invasions, including from Egypt and Italy; as a result, Ethiopia and Liberia preserved their sovereignty during the Scramble for Africa. In 1935, Ethiopia was occupied by Fascist Italy and annexed with Italian-possessed Eritrea and Somaliland, later forming Italian East Africa. In 1941, during World War II, it was occupied by the British Army, and its full sovereignty was restored in 1944 after a period of military administration. The Derg, a Soviet-backed military junta, took power in 1974 after deposing Emperor Haile Selassie and the Solomonic dynasty, and ruled the country for nearly 17 years amidst the Ethiopian Civil War. Following the dissolution of the Derg in 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) dominated the country with a new constitution and ethnic-based federalism. Since then, Ethiopia has suffered from prolonged and unsolved inter-ethnic clashes and political instability marked by democratic backsliding. From 2018, regional and ethnically based factions carried out armed attacks in multiple ongoing wars throughout Ethiopia.[31]\n\n\nEthiopia is a multi-ethnic state with over 80 different ethnic groups. Christianity is the most widely professed faith in the country, with significant minorities of the adherents of Islam and a small percentage to traditional faiths. This sovereign state is a founding member of the UN, the Group of 24, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, and the Organisation of African Unity. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of the global non-governmental organizations focused on Africa. Ethiopia has been invited to join BRICS and will become a full member starting January 1, 2024.[32] Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries but is sometimes considered an emerging power,[33][34] having the fastest economic growth in Sub-Saharan African countries because of foreign direct investment in expansion of agricultural and manufacturing industries;[35] agriculture is the country's largest economic sector, accounting for 36% of the gross domestic product as of 2020.[36] However, in terms of per capita income and the Human Development Index,[37] the country is regarded as poor, with high rates of poverty,[38] poor respect for human rights, widespread ethnic discrimination, and a literacy rate of only 49%.[39]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aethiopia\n\nThe Greek name Αἰθιοπία (from Αἰθίοψ, *Aithiops*, \"an Ethiopian\") is a compound word, later explained as derived from the Greek words αἴθω and ὤψ (*aithō* \"I burn\" + *ōps* \"face\"). According to the Liddell-Scott Jones Greek-English Lexicon, the designation properly translates as *burnt-face* in noun form and *red-brown* in adjectival form.[40] The historian Herodotus used the appellation to denote those parts of Africa south of the Sahara that were then known within the Ecumene (habitable world).[41] The earliest mention of the term is found in the works of Homer, where it is used to refer to two people groups, one in Africa and one in the east from eastern Turkey to India.[42] This Greek name was borrowed into Amharic as ኢትዮጵያ, *ʾĪtyōṗṗyā*. More likely Αἰθιοπία was derived from a native word *ዕጣን* (ʿəṭan, incense), of which Ethiopia was an important source.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Greco-Roman epigraphs, *Aethiopia* was a specific toponym for ancient Nubia.[43] At least as early as c. 850,[44] the name *Aethiopia* also occurs in many translations of the Old Testament in allusion to Nubia. The ancient Hebrew texts identify Nubia instead as Kush.[45] However, in the New Testament, the Greek term Aithiops does occur, referring to a servant of the Kandake, the queen of Kush.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the Hellenic and biblical traditions, the Monumentum Adulitanum, a 3rd-century inscription belonging to the Aksumite Empire, indicates that Aksum's ruler governed an area that was flanked to the west by the territory of Ethiopia and Sasu. The Aksumite King Ezana eventually conquered Nubia the following century, and the Aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation \"Ethiopians\" for their own kingdom. In the Ge'ez version of the Ezana inscription, Aἰθίοπες is equated with the unvocalized *Ḥbšt* and *Ḥbśt* (Ḥabashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym was subsequently rendered as *ḥbs* ('Aḥbāsh) in Sabaic and as *Ḥabasha* in Arabic.[43]\n\n\nIn the 15th-century Ge'ez *Book of Axum*, the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called *Ityopp'is*. He was an extra-biblical son of Cush, son of Ham, said to have founded the city of Axum.[47]\n\n\nIn English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was historically known as Abyssinia. This toponym was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient *Habash*.[48]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ethiopia\n\nFurther information: Ethiopian historiography\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Ethiopia\n\n![](image)A *Homo sapiens idaltu* hominid skull\nSeveral important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of palaeontology. The oldest hominid discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2 million-year-old *Ardipithecus ramidus* (Ardi) found by Tim D. White in 1994.[49] The most well-known hominid discovery is *Australopithecus afarensis* (Lucy). Known locally as *Dinkinesh*, the specimen was found in the Awash Valley of Afar Region in 1974 by Donald Johanson, and is one of the most complete and best-preserved adult Australopithecine fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made. This hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago.[50][51][52]\n\n\nEthiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of anatomically modern humans, *Homo sapiens*. The oldest of these local fossil finds, the Omo remains, were excavated in the southwestern Omo Kibish area and have been dated to the Middle Paleolithic, around 200,000 years ago.[53] Additionally, skeletons of *Homo sapiens idaltu* were found at a site in the Middle Awash valley. Dated to approximately 160,000 years ago, they may represent an extinct subspecies of *Homo sapiens*, or the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans.[54] Archaic *Homo sapiens* fossils excavated at the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco have since been dated to an earlier period, about 300,000 years ago,[55] while Omo-Kibish I (Omo I) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known (196 ± 5 ka).[56]\n\n\nAccording to some linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic era from the family's proposed urheimat (\"original homeland\") in the Nile Valley,[57] or the Near East.[58] The majority of scholars today propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in northeast Africa because of the higher diversity of lineages in that region, a telltale sign of linguistic origin.[59][60][61]\n\n\nIn 2019, archaeologists discovered a 30,000-year-old Middle Stone Age rock shelter at the Fincha Habera site in Bale Mountains at an elevation of 3,469 metres (11,381 feet) above sea level. At this high altitude, humans are susceptible both to hypoxia and to extreme weather. According to a study published in the journal *Science*, this dwelling is proof of the earliest permanent human occupation at high altitude yet discovered. Thousands of animal bones, hundreds of stone tools, and ancient fireplaces were discovered, revealing a diet that featured giant mole rats.[62][63][64][65][66][67][68]\n\n\nEvidence of some of the earliest known stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of *Homo sapiens*), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, which date to around 279,000 years ago.[69] In 2019, additional Middle Stone Age projectile weapons were found at Aduma, dated 100,000–80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.[70]\n\n\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dʿmt and Kingdom of Aksum\n\n![](image)Aksumite currency of the Aksumite king called Endubis, 227–35, at the British Museum.[c]\nIn 980 BC, Dʿmt was established in present-day Eritrea and the Tigray Region of Ethiopia and is widely believed to be the successor state to Punt. This polity's capital was located at Yeha in what is now northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although in earlier times many suggested it was Sabaean-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the Red Sea.[71]\n\n\nOther scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from Southern Arabia. However, Ge'ez, the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from the Sabaean language. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed.[72][73] Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Axumite state.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Empire of Axum at its peak in the 6th century.\nAfter the fall of Dʿmt during the 4th century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the 1st century AD, the Kingdom of Aksum emerged in what is now Tigray Region and Eritrea. According to the medieval *Book of Axum*, the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.[47] Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.[74] The Persian prophet Mani listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his era, during the 3rd century.[75] It is also believed that there was a connection between Egyptian and Ethiopian churches. There is diminutive evidence that the Aksumites were associated with the Queen of Sheba, via their royal inscription.[76]\n\n\nAround 316 AD, Frumentius and his brother Edesius from Tyre accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as slaves. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum.[77] A coin dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after Armenia did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so. The Aksumites were accustomed to the Greco-Roman sphere of influence, but embarked on significant cultural ties and trade connections between the Indian subcontinent and the Roman Empire via the Silk Road, primarily exporting ivory, tortoise shell, gold and emeralds, and importing silk and spices.[76][78]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopia in the Middle Ages\n\nThe kingdom adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" during the reign of Ezana in the 4th century. After the conquest of Kingdom of Kush in 330, the Aksumite territory reached its peak between the 5th and 6th centuries.[71] This period was interrupted by several incursions into the South Arabian protectorate, including Jewish Dhu Nuwas of the Himyarite Kingdom and the Aksumite–Persian wars. In 575, the Aksumites besieged and retook Sana'a following the assassination of its governor Sayf ibn Dhī Yazan. The port city of Adulis was plundered by Arab Muslims in the 8th century; along with irrevocable land degradation, claimed climate change and sporadic rainfall precipitation from 730 to 760,[79] the kingdom likely said to decline its power and important trade route, and Red Sea was left to the Rashidun Caliphate in 646.[71][80] Aksum came to an end in 960 when Queen Gudit defeated the last king of Aksum.[81] In response, the remnant of the Aksumite population to shift into the southern region and establish the Zagwe dynasty, changing its capital to Lalibela.[82] Zagwe's rule ended when an Amhara noble man Yekuno Amlak revolted against King Yetbarak and established the Ethiopian Empire (known by exonym \"Abyssinia\").\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ethiopian Empire under Emperor Amda Seyon I\nThe Ethiopian Empire initiated territorial expansion under the leadership of Amda Seyon I. He launched campaigns against his Muslim adversaries to the east, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of power in favor of the Christians for the next two centuries. After Amda Seyon's successful eastern campaigns, most of the Muslim principalities in the Horn of Africa came under the suzerainty of the Ethiopian Empire. Among these Muslim entities was the Sultanate of Ifat. During the reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob, the Ethiopian Empire reached its pinnacle. His rule was marked by the consolidation of territorial acquisitions from earlier rulers, the oversight of the construction of numerous churches and monasteries, the active promotion of literature and art, and the strengthening of central imperial authority.[83][84][85] Ifat's successor, the Adal Sultanate,[86] tried to conquer Ethiopia during the Ethiopian–Adal War, but was ultimately defeated at the 1543 Battle of Wayna Daga.[87]\n\n\nBy the 16th century, an influx of migration by ethnic Oromo into northern parts of the region fragmented the empire's power. Embarking from present-day Guji and Borena Zone, the Oromos were largely motivated by several folkloric conceptions—beginning with *Moggaasaa*[88] and *Liqimssa*—many of whom related to their raids. This persisted until *gada* of Meslé.[89][90] According to Abba Bahrey, the earliest expansion occurred under Emperor Dawit II (*luba* Melbah), when they encroached to Bale before invading Adal Sultanate.[91]\n\n\nEthiopia saw major diplomatic contact with Portugal from the 17th century, mainly related to religion. Beginning in 1555,[92] Portuguese Jesuits attempted to develop Roman Catholicism as the state religion. After several failures, they sent several missionaries in 1603, including the most influential, Spanish Jesuit Pedro Paez.[93] Under Emperor Susenyos I, Roman Catholicism became the state religion of the Ethiopian Empire in 1622.[94] This decision caused an uprising by the Orthodox populace.[95]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period (1632–1855)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gondarine period and Zemene Mesafint\n\n![](image)Fasil Ghebbi one of the most important castles of the Gondarine period.\nIn 1632, Emperor Fasilides successfully halted Roman Catholic state administration and restored Orthodox Tewahedo as the state religion.[94] Fasilides' reign sparked solidification of imperial power and moved the capital to Gondar in 1636, commencing a period of transition known as \"Gondarine period\".[96] He expelled Jesuits by reclaiming possessed lands and relegating them to Fremona. During his reign, he built one of the most iconic royal fortress, Fasil Ghebbi, forty-four churches were built[97] and Ethiopian art was revived. He also credited with constructing seven stone bridges over Blue Nile River.[98]\n\n\nGondar's power and reputation decayed following the death of Iyasu I in 1706 because most emperors preferred to enjoy luxurious life rather than spending in politics. After Iyasu II death in 1755, Empress Mentewab brought her brother, Ras Wolde Leul, to Gondar and made him Ras Bitwaded, resulted in regnal conflict between Mentewab's *Quaregnoch* and Wollo group led by Wubit. In 1767, Ras Mikael Sehul, a regent in Tigray Province, seized Gondar and murdered the child Iyoas I in 1769, who was emperor at the time, and installed 70-year-old Yohannes II.[99]\n\n\nBetween 1769 and 1855, Ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the Zemene Mesafint or \"Age of Princes\". The emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like *Ras* Mikael Sehul, Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray, and by the Yejju Oromo dynasty of the Wara Sheh, such as Ras Gugsa of Yejju. Prior to the Zemene Mesafint, Emperor Iyoas I had introduced the Oromo language (*Afaan Oromo*) at court, instead of Amharic.[100][101]\n\n\n\n### Age of Imperialism (1855–1916)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British expedition to Abyssinia, Menelik's Invasions, Egyptian–Ethiopian War, First Italo-Ethiopian War, and Mahdist War\n\n![](image)Emperor Tewodros II (r. 1855–1868) brought an end of *Zemene Mesafint*Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded with an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern Ethiopia (Gondar, Gojjam, and Shewa) were briefly united after the power of the emperor was restored beginning with the reign of Tewodros II.[102][103] Tewodros II began a process of consolidation, centralisation, and state-building that would be continued by succeeding emperors. This process reduced the power of regional rulers, restructured the empire's administration, and created a professional army. These changes created the basis for establishing the effective sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ethiopian state.[104] In 1875 and 1876, Ottoman and Egyptian forces, accompanied by many European and American advisors, twice invaded Abyssinia but were initially defeated.[105] From 1885 to 1889 (under Yohannes IV), Ethiopia joined the Mahdist War allied to Britain, Turkey, and Egypt against the Sudanese Mahdist State. In 1887, Menelik II, king of Shewa, invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo.[106] On 10 March 1889, Yohannes IV was killed by the Sudanese Khalifah Abdullah's army whilst leading his army in the Battle of Gallabat.[107]\n\n\nEthiopia, in roughly its current form, began under the reign of Menelik II, who was Emperor from 1889 until his death in 1913. From his base in the central province of Shewa, Menelik set out to annex territories to the south, east, and west[108] — areas inhabited by the Oromo, Sidama, Gurage, Welayta, and other peoples.[109] He achieved this with the help of *Ras* Gobana Dacche's Shewan Oromo militia, which occupied lands that had not been held since Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's war, as well as other areas that had never been under Ethiopian rule.[110]\n\n\nFor his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II was heralded as a national hero. He had signed the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy in May 1889, by which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims. This First Italo–Ethiopian War culminated in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.[109][111] During this time, about a third of the population died in the Great Ethiopian Famine (1888 to 1892).[112][113]\n\n\n\n### Haile Selassie I era (1916–1974)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Italian Ethiopia, Italian East Africa, Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Eritrean War of Independence\n\n![](image)Ethiopian troops sent by the government under the Emperor Haile Selassie I during the Korean War fighting for South Korean independence\n![](image)Emperor Haile Selassie I with U.S President Roosevelt after War World II\nThe early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie *(Ras Tafari)*. He came to power after Lij Iyasu was deposed, and undertook a nationwide modernization campaign from 1916 when he was made a *Ras* and Regent (*Inderase*) for the Empress Regnant Zewditu, and became the *de facto* ruler of the Ethiopian Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2 November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor.[114] In 1931, Haile Selassie endowed Ethiopia with its first-ever Constitution in emulation of Imperial Japan's 1890 Constitution.[115]\nThe independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, beginning when it was invaded by Fascist Italy in early October 1935, and by subsequent Italian rule of the country (1936–1941) after Italian victory in the war.[116] Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with the *Arbegnoch*, liberated Ethiopia in the course of the East African campaign in 1941. The country was placed under British military administration, and then Ethiopia's full sovereignty was restored with the signing of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement in December 1944.[117]\n\n\nOn 24 October 1945, Ethiopia became a founding member of the United Nations. In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated a federation with Eritrea. He dissolved this in 1962 and annexed Eritrea, resulting in the Eritrean War of Independence.[*citation needed*] Haile Selassie also played a leading role in the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).[118] Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie, owing to the worldwide 1973 oil crisis causing a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974, leading to student and worker protests.[119] The feudal oligarchical cabinet of Aklilu Habte-Wold was toppled, and a new government was formed with Endelkachew Makonnen serving as Prime Minister.[120]\n\n\n\n### Derg era (1974–1991)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ethiopian Revolution, Derg, People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Civil War, Red Terror, and 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Mengistu Haile Mariam was sentenced to death *in absentia* for committing crimes during his rule\nHaile Selassie's rule ended on 12 September 1974, when he was deposed by the Derg, a committee made up of military and police officers.[121] After the execution of 60 former government and military officials,[122] the new Provisional Military Administrative Council abolished the monarchy in March 1975 and established Ethiopia as a Marxist-Leninist state.[123] The abolition of feudalism, increased literacy, nationalization, and sweeping land reform including the resettlement and villagization from the Ethiopian Highlands became priorities.[124]\n\n\nAfter a power struggle in 1977, Mengistu Halie Mariam gained undisputed leadership of the Derg.[125] In 1977, Somalia, which had previously been receiving assistance and arms from the USSR, invaded Ethiopia in the Ogaden War, capturing part of the Ogaden region. Ethiopia recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the Soviet bloc countries.[126][127][128]\n\n\nIn 1976–78, up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the Red Terror,[129] a violent political repression campaign by the Derg against various opposition groups.[130][131][132] In 1987, the Derg dissolved itself and established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) upon the adoption of the 1987 Constitution of Ethiopia.[133] A 1983–85 famine affected around 8 million people, resulting in 1 million dead. Insurrections against authoritarian rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements in 1989, to form the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).[134]\n\n\nThe collapse of Marxism–Leninism during the revolutions of 1989 coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990.[135][136][137] EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa in May 1991, and Mengistu fled the country and was granted asylum in Zimbabwe.[138][139]\n\n\n\n### Federal Democratic Republic (1991–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the federal government of Ethiopia\n\nFurther information: Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict, Ethiopian civil conflict (2018–present), and Tigray War\nSee also: Eritrean independence referendum, 1993\n\n![](image)Ethiopian civil conflict: territorial control as of September 2023[d]\nIn July 1991, the EPRDF convened a National Conference to establish the Transitional Government of Ethiopia composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution.[140] In 1994, a new constitution was written that established a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature and a judicial system.[141]\n\n\nIn April 1993, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia after a national referendum.[142] In May 1998, a border dispute with Eritrea led to the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1 million a day.[143] This had a negative effect on Ethiopia's economy, and a border conflict between the two countries would continue until 2018.[144][145] As of 2018, further civil war in Ethiopia continues, mainly due to destabilization of the country.\n\n\nEthnic violence rose during the late 2010s and early 2020s,[146][147] with various clashes and conflicts leading to millions of Ethiopians being displaced.[148][149][150]\n\n\nThe federal government that elections for election in 2020 (later being rescheduled to 2021) be cancelled, due to health and safety concerns about COVID-19.[151] The Tigray Region's TPLF opposed this, and proceeded to hold elections anyway on 9 September 2020.[152][153] Relations between the federal government and Tigray deteriorated rapidly,[154] and in November 2020, Ethiopia began a military offensive in Tigray in response to attacks on army units stationed there, marking the beginning of the Tigray War.[155][156] By March 2022, as many as 500,000 people had died as a result of violence and famine.[157][158][159] After a number of peace and mediation proposals in the intervening years, Ethiopia and the Tigrayan rebel forces agreed to a cessation of hostilities on 2 November 2022.[160]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Ethiopia, Law of Ethiopia, and Judiciary of Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Rulers and Heads of State of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)House of People's Representatives is the lower house of the Ethiopian Federal Parliamentary Assembly\nEthiopia is a federal parliamentary republic, wherein the Prime Minister is the head of government, and the President is the head of state but with largely ceremonial powers. Executive power is exercised by the government and federal legislative power vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. The House of Federation is the upper chamber of the bicameral legislature with 108 seats, and the lower chamber is the House of Peoples' Representatives (HoPR) with 547 seats. The House of Federation is chosen by the regional councils whereas MPs of the HoPR are elected directly, in turn, they elect the president for a six-year term and the prime minister for a 5-year term.\n\n\nThe Ethiopian judiciary consists of dual system with two court structures: the federal and state courts. The FDRE Constitution vested federal judicial authority to the Federal Supreme Court which can overturn and review decisions of subordinate federal courts; itself has regular division assigned for fundamental errors of law. In addition, the Supreme Court can perform circuit hearings in established five states at any states of federal levels or \"area designated for its jurisdiction\" if deemed \"necessary for the efficient rendering of justice\".[161][162]\n\n\nThe Federal Supreme Proclamation granted three subject matter principles: laws, parties and place to federal court jurisdiction, first \"cases arising under the Constitution, federal laws and international treaties\", second over \"parties specified by federal laws\".[163]\n\n\nOn the basis of Article 78 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution, the judiciary is completely independent of the executive and the legislature.[164] To ensure this, the vice-president and President of the Supreme Court appointed by Parliament on the nomination of Prime Minister. Once elected, the executive power has no authority to remove from office. Other judges are nominated by the Federal Judicial Administration Council (FJAC) on the basis of transparent criteria and the Prime Minister's recommendation for appointment in the HoPR. In all cases, judges cannot be removed from their duty unless they retired, violated disciplinary rules, gross incompatibility, or inefficiency to unfit due to ill health. Contrary, the majority vote of HoPR have the right to sanction removal in federal judiciary level or state council in cases of state judges.[165] In 2015, the realities of this provision were questioned in a report prepared by Freedom House.[166]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Ethiopia\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed\n![](image)\nPresident Sahle-Work Zewde\n\nPost-1995, Ethiopia's politics has been liberalized which promotes all-encompassing reforms to the country. Today, its economy is based on mixed, market-oriented principles.[165] Ethiopia has eleven semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first multiparty election took place in May 1995, which was won by the EPRDF.[167] The president of the transitional government, EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi, became the first Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and Negasso Gidada was elected its president.[168] Meles' government was consistenly re-elected; however, these results were heavily criticized by international observers, and denounced by the opposition as fraudulent.[169]\n\n\nMeles died on 20 August 2012 in Brussels, where he was being treated for an unspecified illness.[170] Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was appointed as a new prime minister until the 2015 elections,[171] and remained so afterwards with his party in control of every parliamentary seat.[172] On 15 February 2018, Hailemariam resigned as Prime Minister, following years of protests and a state of emergency.[173][174][175] Abiy Ahmed became prime minister following Hailemariam's resignation. He made a historic visit to Eritrea in 2018, ending the state of conflict between the two countries,[145] and was awarded the Nobel prize for peace in 2019.[176]\n\n\nAccording to the Democracy Index published by the United Kingdom-based Economist Intelligence Unit in late 2010, Ethiopia was an \"authoritarian regime\", ranking as the 118th-most democratic out of 167 countries.[177] Ethiopia had dropped 13 places on the list since 2008, and the 2010 report attributed the drop to the government's crackdown on opposition activities, media, and civil society before the 2010 parliamentary election, which the report argued had made Ethiopia a *de facto* one-party state.[178]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in G8 Group meeting in 2007 File:Israeli PM with Ethiopian Prime Minister Ahmed.jpgEthiopian Prime Minister Ali with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu\nEthiopia was historically a trading nation that exported goods such as gold, ivory, exotic animals, and incense.[179] Many historians[*who?*] have concluded that modern Ethiopian foreign relations began under Emperor Tewodros II, who during his reign sought to re-establish a cohesive Ethiopian state, but was thwarted by the British expedition of 1868.[180] Since then, the country was seen redundant by world powers until the opening of Suez Canal due to an influence of Mahdist War.[181][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nToday, Ethiopia maintains strong relations with China, Israel, Mexico, Turkey and India as well as neighboring countries. Ethiopia is a strategic partner of Global War on Terrorism and African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).[182] US. Former President Barack Obama was the first incumbent US president to visit Ethiopia in July 2015; the speech he gave in African Union during this trip focused on combatting Islamic terrorism.[183][184] Emigration from Ethiopia is primarily directed towards Europe, including Italy, United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Australia, while emigration to the Middle East is primarily to Saudi Arabia and Israel. Ethiopia is founding member of the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement and the G77. In 1963, the Organization of African Unity, which later renamed itself the African Union, was founded in Addis Ababa, which today hosts the secretariat of the African Union, the African Union Commission. In addition, Ethiopia is also a member of the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of global NGOs focused on Africa.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEthiopia's foreign relations with both Sudan and Egypt are somewhat fraught owing to the effects the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project, which was escalated in 2020, would have on water rights in the region.[185][186] Despite six upstream countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania) signing the Nile Basin Initiative in 2010, Egypt and Sudan rejected a water sharing treaty, citing the reduction of amount of water to the Nile Basin and the challenge it would pose to their historic connection of water rights.[187][188] In 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed warned that \"No force can stop Ethiopia from building a dam. If there is need to go to war, we could get millions readied.\"[189]\n\n\nEthiopia is one of the African countries that as founding member of League of Nations, which served as the predecessor for the United Nations, since 1923. UN taskforces in Ethiopia deal primarily with humanitarian issues and development. Some of its agencies[*which?*] maintain regional ties with United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union. The UN prioritizes sustainable development in Ethiopia, including fighting poverty, sustainable economic growth, climate change policy, educational and healthcare provisions, increasing employment, and environmental protection.[190]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMain articles: Subdivisions of Ethiopia, Regions of Ethiopia, List of zones of Ethiopia, and Districts of Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia is administratively divided into four levels: regions, zones, *woredas* (districts) and *kebele* (wards).[191][192] The country comprises 12 regions and two city administrations under these regions, plenty of zones, woredas and neighbourhood administration: kebeles. The two federal-level city administrations are Addis Ababa and Dire Dava.[193]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of regions and zones of Ethiopia (before August 2023)\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military history of Ethiopia and Ethiopian National Defense Force\n\n![](image)Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) training under AMISOM, 2021\nThe Ethiopian army's origins and military traditions date back to the earliest history of Ethiopia. Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics and has been subject to foreign invasions. In 1579, the Ottoman Empire's attempt to expand from a coastal base at Massawa during the Ottoman conquest of Habesh was defeated.[194] The Army of the Ethiopian Empire was also able to defeat the Egyptians in 1876 at Gura, led by Ethiopian Emperor Yohannes IV.[195]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Army under Kagnew Battalion unit involved in the Korean War from 1950, fought as part of United Nations Command. Some publications stated that Ethiopian troops remained for 15 years, though other stated they left until 1975, as part of the UN Command.[196] The battalion sized 6,037 troops at the time of the war.[197]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian National Defense Force is the military force of Ethiopia. The ENDF consists of two separate branches: the Ethiopian Ground Forces and the Ethiopian Air Force. Since 1996, Ethiopia has lacked a navy as the country is landlocked; however, in 2018 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed re-established the Ethiopian Navy, which is currently undergoing training with an unknown date of formal formation.[198][199]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian military is often stated to be the strongest in East Africa, and among the top five strongest militaries in the continent of Africa. Per some estimates, it is the 49th most capable military in the world.[200][201]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Ethiopia and Crime in Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Police brutality in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Ethiopian federal police vehicles driving through Addis Ababa\nThe constitution guarantees law enforcement duty to the Ethiopian Federal Police (EFP). The EFP is responsible for safeguarding and public welfare in federal level. Founded in 1995, the federal police surveyed by Federal Police Commissioner since October 2000; the Federal Police Commissioner then reports task to the Ministry of Peace, however it was overrode after political reforms in 2018, and directed to the parliament. In previous years, the federal police reports the Ministry's tasks directly. In addition, the federal police have ability to disclose regional police commissions, in order for assistance. Independently, the local militias uphold security.[202]\n\n\nBribery is a basic concern, especially observed by traffic police. Police brutality appeared as severe in recent years. On 26 August 2019, a video of handcuffed man beaten by two police officers as an elderly woman intervened the scene in Addis Ababa went viral. Recent police misconduct is said to be a failure of Federal Police Commissioner to abide Article 52 of the constitution, which states investigation of unlawful use of force, and dismissal of those misconducted officer. The African Union's Luanda and Robben Island Guidelines or the United Nations' Declaration on Justice for Victims of Abuse of Power and their Basic Principles on the Use of Force & Firearms are once obligated to the Ethiopian government disciplinary committee to combat police brutality in both individual and systemic level.[203]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Ethiopia\n\nFurther information: War crimes in the Tigray War\n\n![](image)Peaceful demonstrators in Tigray calling for the full implementation of the 2022 Pretoria Agreement; July 2023\nHuman rights violations often often involve ethnic and communal violence in the country.[204] In a 2016 demonstration, 100 peaceful protestors were killed by direct government gunfire in the Oromia and Amhara regions.[205] The UN called for observers on the ground in Ethiopia to investigate this incident, but the Ethiopian government refused this call.[206][207] The protests were about land grabs and a lack of basic human rights, such as the freedom to elect their representatives.[208] Journalists and activists have been threatened or arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.[209] LGBT people are legally persecuted within Ethiopia.[210]\n\n\nMerera Gudina, leader of the Oromo People's Congress, said the East African country was at a \"crossroads\". He added in the interview with Reuters: \"People are demanding their rights\", he said. \"People are fed up with what the regime has been doing for a quarter of a century. They're protesting against land grabs, reparations, stolen elections, the rising cost of living, many things. \"If the government continue to repress while the people are demanding their rights in the millions that (civil war) is one of the likely scenarios.\"[208]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Relief map of Ethiopia\nAt 1,104,300 square kilometres (426,372.61 sq mi),[211] Ethiopia is the world's 28th-largest country, comparable in size to Bolivia. It lies between the 3rd parallel north and the 15th parallel north and longitudes 33rd meridian east and 48th meridian east.\n\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the Horn of Africa, which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the Great Rift Valley, which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, steppes, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive Afromontane in the northern and southwestern parts. Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile. It also has many endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n\nThe nation is a land of geographical contrasts, ranging from the vast fertile west, with its forests and numerous rivers, to the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent. Ethiopia also has the second-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa.[212]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of Ethiopia and Climate change in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification of Ethiopia\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around 2,000–2,500 m (6,562–8,202 ft) above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum. The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of Mount Entoto at an elevation of around 2,400 metres (7,900 ft). It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately 1,200 millimetres (47 in).\n\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is 16 °C (60.8 °F), with daily maximum temperatures averaging 20–25 °C (68.0–77.0 °F) throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging 5–10 °C (41.0–50.0 °F).\n\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands in the east of Ethiopia, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the Danakil Depression in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of 34 °C (93.2 °F).\n\n\n\n![](image)The Blue Nile falls during winter provides over 86 percent of the Nile river's water coming from melted snow in the Simien mountains below 0.[213][214]\nEthiopia is vulnerable to many of the effects of climate change. These include increases in temperature and changes in precipitation. Climate change in these forms threatens food security and the economy, which is agriculture based.[215] Many Ethiopians have been forced to leave their homes and travel as far as the Gulf, Southern Africa and Europe.[216]\n\n\nSince April 2019, the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has promoted Beautifying Sheger, a development project that aims to reduce the negative effects of climate change – among other things – in the capital city Addis Ababa.[217] In the following May, the government held \"Dine for Sheger\", a fundraising event in order to cover some of the $1 billion needed through the public.[218] $25 million was raised through the expensive event, both through the cost of attending and donations.[219] Two Chinese railway companies under the Belt and Road Initiative between China and Ethiopia had supplied funds to develop 12 of the total 56 kilometres.[220]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Ethiopia\nSee also: Environmental issues in Ethiopia and Deforestation in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)A Walia Ibex in Simien Mountains National Park, one of the national symbols of Ethiopia only found in the Northern parts of the country\nEthiopia is a global centre of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.[221] Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered. Many of these birds feed on butterflies, like the *Bicyclus anynana*.[222][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nHistorically, throughout the African continent, wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging, civil wars, pollution, poaching, and other human factors.[223] A 17-year-long civil war, along with severe drought, negatively affected Ethiopia's environmental conditions, leading to even greater habitat degradation.[224] Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment. When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust. Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gases.[225] With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.[226]\n\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.[227] Ethiopia has many species listed as critically endangered and vulnerable to global extinction. The threatened species in Ethiopia can be broken down into three categories (based on IUCN ratings): critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.[227]\n\n\nEthiopia is one of the eight fundamental and independent centres of origin for cultivated plants in the world.[228] However, deforestation is a major concern for Ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion, loss of nutrients in the soil, loss of animal habitats, and reduction in biodiversity. At the beginning of the 20th century, around 420,000 km2 (or 35%) of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees, but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.[229] The country had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.16/10, ranking it 50th globally out of 172 countries.[230]\n\n\nEthiopia loses an estimated 1,410 km2 of natural forests each year due to firewood collection, conversion to farmland, overgrazing, and use of forest wood for building material. Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21,000 km2 of forests.[231] Current government programs to control deforestation consist of education, promoting reforestation programs, and providing raw materials which are alternatives to timber. In rural areas the government also provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat.[232]\n\n\nOrganizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management.[233]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Ethiopia and Industrial sector in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Development of GDP per capita\nEthiopia registered the fastest economic growth under Meles Zenawi's administration.[234]\nAccording to the IMF, Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, registering over 10% economic growth from 2004 through 2009.[235] It was the fastest-growing non-oil-dependent African economy in the years 2007 and 2008.[236] In 2015, the World Bank highlighted that Ethiopia had witnessed rapid economic growth with real domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 10.9% between 2004 and 2014.[237]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2011, Ethiopia's growth performance and considerable development gains were challenged by high inflation and a difficult balance of payments situation. Inflation surged to 40% in August 2011 because of loose monetary policy, large civil service wage increase in early 2011, and high food prices.[238] For 2011–12, end-year inflation was projected to be about 22%, and single digit inflation is projected in 2012–13 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies.[239]\n\n\nIn spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa.[240] In 2019 a law was passed allowing expatriate Ethiopians to invest in Ethiopia's financial service industry.[241]\n\n\n\n![](image)An Ethiopian logistics shipping cargo docked at the red sea\nThe Ethiopian constitution specifies that rights to own land belong only to \"the state and the people\", but citizens may lease land for up to 99 years, but are unable to mortgage or sell. Renting out land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues.[242] As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without a home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests. In addition, agricultural productivity remains low, and frequent droughts still beset the country, also leading to internal displacement.[243]\n\n\n\n### Energy and hydropower[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy in Ethiopia and List of power stations in Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia has 14 major rivers flowing from its highlands, including the Nile. It has the largest water reserves in Africa. As of 2012[update], hydroelectric plants represented around 88.2% of the total installed electricity generating capacity.\n\n\nThe remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels (8.3%) and renewable sources (3.6%).\n\n\nThe electrification rate for the total population in 2016 was 42%, with 85% coverage in urban areas and 26% coverage in rural areas. As of 2016[update], total electricity production was 11.15 TW⋅h and consumption was 9.062 TW⋅h. There were 0.166 TW⋅h of electricity exported, 0 kW⋅h imported, and 2.784 GW of installed generating capacity.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)A factory in Dire Dawa: one of Ethiopia's biggest economic cities\nEthiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the Blue Nile, Sobat River and Atbara. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to use the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.[244] The Gibe III hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870 MW. For the year 2017–18 (2010 E.C) this hydroelectric dam generated 4,900 GW⋅h.[245]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Ethiopia\nAgriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP.[19] Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a Vavilov centre of diversity for domesticated crops, including enset,[246] coffee and teff.\n\n\nExports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of Gold exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.[247] According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 as of 2011[update].[248]\n\n\n\n### Exports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coffee production in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)\nLight rail train in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia which hosts over 100,000 passengers a day[*citation needed*]\n![](image)\nEthiopia's biggest company Ethiopian Airlines which has an annual revenue of 6.1 billion dollars making it the 14th biggest airlines in revenue: contributes to the country's export business[*citation needed*]\n![](image)\nEthio Telecom is one of the country's biggest companies which generates over a billion dollars annually[*citation needed*]\n\nEthiopia is often considered as the birthplace of coffee since cultivation began in the 9th century.[249] Exports from Ethiopia in the 2009–2010 financial year totalled US$1.4 billion.[250] Ethiopia produces more coffee than any other nation on the continent.[251] \"Coffee provides a livelihood for close to 15 million Ethiopians, 16% of the population. Farmers in the eastern part of the country, where a warming climate is already impacting production, have struggled in recent years, and many are currently reporting largely failed harvests as a result of a prolonged drought\".[252]\n\n\nEthiopia also has the 5th largest inventory of cattle.[253] Other main export commodities are khat, gold, leather products, and oilseeds. Recent development of the floriculture sector means Ethiopia is poised to become one of the top flower and plant exporters in the world.[254]\n\n\nCross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In East Africa, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep, and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Djibouti, and Kenya generates an estimated total value of between 250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).[255]\n\n\nThis trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions, and promote regional integration.[255] However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.[255] Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.[255]\n\n\nWith the private sector growing slowly, designer leather products like bags are becoming a big export business, with Taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country.[256] Additional small-scale export products include cereals, pulses, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, and hides. With the construction of various new dams and growing hydroelectric power projects around the country, Ethiopia also plans to export electric power to its neighbours.[257][258]\n\n\nMost regard Ethiopia's large water resources and potential as its \"white oil\" and its coffee resources as \"black gold\".[259][260]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia has 926 km of electrified 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge railways, 656 km for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway between Addis Ababa and the Port of Djibouti (via Awash)[261] and 270 km for the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway between Addis Ababa and the twin cities of Dessie/Kombolcha[262]\n\n\nEthiopia had 58 airports as of 2012[update],[19] and 61 as of 2016[update].[263] Among these, the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa and the Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport in Dire Dawa accommodate international flights.\n\n\nEthiopian Airlines, a member of the Star Alliance, is the country's flag carrier, and is wholly owned by the Government of Ethiopia.[264] From its hub at the Bole International Airport, the airline serves a network of 102 international passenger, 20 domestic passenger, and 44 cargo destinations.[265][266] It is also one of the fastest-growing carriers in the industry and continent.[267]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Ethiopia\n\nTourism in Ethiopia accounted for 5.5% of GDP growth in 2006. In 2015, the European Council named Ethiopia \"World's Best Tourism Destination\".[268] In 2020 the country registered 518,000 tourists, ranked 126th in the world.[269] There are nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia:[270] Tourist destinations include Ethiopia's collection of national parks (including Semien Mountains National Park), and historic sites, such as the cities of Axum, Lalibela and Gondar, Harar Jugol walled city, Negash Mosque, in Negash and Sof Omar Caves.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Ethiopians and List of ethnic groups in Ethiopia\n\n| Ethnic groups in Ethiopia |\n| --- |\n| Ethnic group |  | Population |\n| Oromo |  | 25.4 (34.4%) |\n| Amhara |  | 19.9 (27.0%) |\n| Somali |  | 4.59 (6.2%) |\n| Tigrayans |  | 4.49 (6.1%) |\n| Sidama |  | 2.95 (4.0%) |\n| Gurage |  | 1.86 (2.5%) |\n| Welayta |  | 1.68 (2.3%) |\n| Afar |  | 1.28 (1.7%) |\n| Hadiya |  | 1.27 (1.7%) |\n| Gamo |  | 1.10 (1.5%) |\n| Others |  | 9.30 (12.6%) |\n| Population in millions according to 2007 Census[6] |\n\nEthiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world.[271] Its total population has grown from 38.1 million in 1983 to 109.5 million in 2018.[272] According to UN estimations in 2013, life expectancy had improved substantially over time, with male life expectancy reported to be 56 years and for women 60 years.[248]\n\n\nEthiopia's population is highly diverse, containing over 80 different ethnic groups, the four largest of which are the Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans. According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while Somalis and Tigrayans represent 6.2% and 6.1% of the population respectively.[6]\n\n\nAfroasiatic-speaking communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the Habesha people. The Arabic form of this term (*al-Ḥabasha*) is the etymological basis of \"Abyssinia\", the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.[273]\n\n\nIn 2009, Ethiopia hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 135,200. The majority of this population came from Somalia (approximately 64,300 persons), Eritrea (41,700) and Sudan (25,900). The Ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps.[274]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Ethiopia\n\nLanguages of Ethiopia as of 2007[update] Census[6]\n\n\n\nOromo (33.8%)\nAmharic (29.3%)\nSomali (6.2%)\nTigrinya (5.9%)\nSidamo (4.0%)\nWolaytta (2.2%)\nGurage (2.0%)\nAfar (1.7%)\nHadiyya (1.7%)\nGamo (1.5%)\nothers (11.6%)\n\nAccording to Glottolog, there are 109 languages spoken in Ethiopia, while *Ethnologue* lists 90 individual languages spoken in the country.[275][276] Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. The former includes the Oromo language, spoken by the Oromo, and Somali, spoken by the Somalis; the latter includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara, and Tigrinya, spoken by the Tigrayans. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage languages, Harari, Silt'e, and Argobba languages.[6] Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas.[277]\n\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language, the medium of instruction in secondary schools and all tertiary education; federal laws are also published in British English in the Federal Negarit Gazeta including the 1995 constitution.[278]\n\n\nAmharic was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromo, Somali or Tigrinya.[279] All languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia.[141]\n\n\n\n#### Script[edit]\n\n\nEthiopia's principal orthography is the Ge'ez script. Employed as an abugida for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language.[280] Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of both the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. During the 1980s, the Ethiopic character set was computerized. It is today part of the Unicode standard as Ethiopic, Ethiopic Extended, Ethiopic Supplement and Ethiopic Extended-A.\n\n\nOther writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include Bakri Sapalo's script for Oromo.[281]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)The Church of Saint George, Lalibela a pilgrimage site for Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church; the site is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela\".[282]\nAccording to the 2007 National Census, Christians make up 62.8% of the country's population (43.5% Ethiopian Orthodox, 19.3% other denominations), Muslims 33.9%, practitioners of traditional faiths 2.6%, and other religions 0.6%.[6] The ratio of the Christian to Muslim population has largely remained stable when compared to previous censuses conducted decades ago.[283] Sunnis form the majority of Muslims with non-denominational Muslims being the second largest group of Muslims, and the Shia and Ahmadiyyas are a minority. Sunnis are largely Shafi'is or Salafis, and there are also many Sufi Muslims there.[284]\n\n\nEthiopia has close historical ties with all three of the world's major Abrahamic religions. In the 4th century, the Ethiopian empire was one of the first in the world to officially adopt Christianity as the state religion. As a result of the resolutions of the Council of Chalcedon, in 451 the Miaphysites, which included the vast majority of Christians in Egypt and Ethiopia, were accused of monophysitism and designated as heretics under the common name of Coptic Christianity (see Oriental Orthodoxy).[285]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is part of Oriental Orthodoxy. It is by far the largest Christian denomination, although a number of P'ent'ay (Protestant) churches have recently gained ground. Since 1930, a relatively small Ethiopian Catholic Church has existed in full communion with Rome, with adherents making up less than 1% of the total population.[283][286]\n\n\nIslam in Ethiopia dates back to the founding of the religion in 622 when a group of Muslims were counselled by Muhammad to escape persecution in Mecca. The disciples subsequently migrated to Abyssinia via modern-day Eritrea, which was at the time ruled by Ashama ibn-Abjar, a pious Christian emperor.[287]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities and towns in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Sheger Park is the largest park in the country, hosting hundreds of thousands of visitors a year since its opening\nPopulation growth, migration, and urbanization are all straining both governments' and ecosystems' capacity to provide people with basic services.[288] Urbanization has steadily been increasing in Ethiopia, with two periods of significantly rapid growth. First, in 1936–1941 during the Italian occupation under Mussolini's fascist government, and then from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban areas tripled.[289]\n\n\nIn 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia, building infrastructure to connect major cities, and a dam providing power and water.[290] This, along with the influx of Italians and labourers, was the major cause of rapid growth during this period. The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975, when rural populations migrated to towns seeking work and better living conditions.[289]\n\n\nThis pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970–1983. This program encouraged the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The legislation did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform.[291] Urban populations have continued to grow with an 8.1% increase from 1975 to 2000.[292]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in EthiopiaCSA (Urban population projection values of 2016)[293]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Region | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | Region | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Addis Ababa](image)Addis Ababa![Gondar](image)Gondar | 1 | Addis Ababa | Addis Ababa | 3,352,000 | 11 | Shashamane | Oromia | 154,587\n | ![Mek'ele](image)Mek'ele![Adama](image)Adama |\n| 2 | Gondar | Amhara | 341,991 | 12 | Bishoftu | Oromia | 153,847\n |\n| 3 | Mek'ele | Tigray | 340,858 | 13 | Sodo | SNNPR | 253,322\n |\n| 4 | Adama | Oromia | 338,940 | 14 | Arba Minch | SNNPR | 151,013\n |\n| 5 | Hawassa | SNNPR | 318,618 | 15 | Hosaena | SNNPR | 141,352\n |\n| 6 | Bahir Dar | Amhara | 297,794 | 16 | Harar | Harari | 133,000\n |\n| 7 | Dire Dawa | Dire Dawa | 285,000 | 17 | Dila | SNNPR | 119,276\n |\n| 8 | Dessie | Amhara | 198,428 | 18 | Nekemte | Oromia | 115,741\n |\n| 9 | Jimma | Oromia | 186,148 | 19 | Debre Birhan | Amhara | 107,827\n |\n| 10 | Jijiga | Somali | 164,321 | 20 | Asella | Oromia | 103,522\n |\n\n#### Rural and urban life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rural flight in Ethiopia\n\nMigration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia lives on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the World Health Organization's (WHO's) minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.[294]\n\n\n\n![](image)Addis Ababa seen at nighttime, the financial epicenter of the country\nMost poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season.[294] The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30 square metre mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.[294]\n\n\nThe peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility.[294] This land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields.[294] Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced.[294] The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working the land and the productivity drops further.[294]\n\n\nAlthough conditions are drastically better in cities, all of Ethiopia suffers from poverty and poor sanitation. However, poverty in Ethiopia fell from 44% to 29.6% during 2000–2011, according to the World Bank.[295] In the capital city of Addis Ababa, 55% of the population used to live in slums.[290] Now, however, a construction boom in both the private and the public sector has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards in major cities, particularly in Addis Ababa. Notably, government-built condominium housing complexes have sprung up throughout the city, benefiting close to 600,000 individuals.[296] Sanitation is the most pressing need in the city, with most of the population lacking access to waste treatment facilities. This contributes to the spread of illness through unhealthy water.[290]\n\n\nDespite the living conditions in the cities, the people of Addis Ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities. Unlike rural children, 69% of urban children are enrolled in primary school, and 35% of those are eligible to attend secondary school.[*clarification needed*][290] Addis Ababa has its own university as well as many other secondary schools. The literacy rate is 82%.[290]\n\n\nMany NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) are working to solve this problem; however, most are far apart, uncoordinated, and working in isolation.[292] The Sub-Saharan Africa NGO Consortium is attempting to coordinate efforts.[292]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Ethiopia and Healthcare in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Declining child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia since 1950\nOnly a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery.[297] The \"WHO estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centres, with adequately trained staff\".[298] Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education, medicines, and hospitals.[290] Life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas, but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country as of 2016, the average Ethiopian living to be 62.2 years old, according to a UNDP report.[299] Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.[292]\n\n\nEthiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable (contagious) diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Over 58 million people (nearly half the population) do not have access to clean water as of 2023.[300] These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities.[301] The World Health Organization's 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1,936 physicians (for 2003), which comes to about 2.6 per 100,000.[302]\n\n\nThe National Mental Health Strategy, published in 2012, introduced the development of policy designed to improve mental health care in Ethiopia. This strategy mandated that mental health be integrated into the primary health care system.[303] However, the success of the National Mental Health Strategy has been limited. For example, the burden of depression is estimated to have increased 34.2% from 2007 to 2017.[304] Furthermore, the prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes, inadequate leadership and co-ordination of efforts, as well as a lack of mental health awareness in the general population, all remain as obstacles to successful mental health care.[305]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Higher education in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Entrance of Addis Ababa University\nThe current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budgetary financing allocated to the education sector. Public education is free at primary levels and usually offers between age 7 and 12. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, then four years of lower secondary school followed by two years of higher secondary school.[306]\n\n\n\nThe Ethiopian education is governed by Ministry of Education and its cycle consists 4+4+2+2 system; elementary education consists of eight years, divided into two cycles of four years, and four years of secondary education, divided into two stages of two years.[307] National exams are conducted by the National Education Assessment and Examination Agency (NEAEA). Since 2018, there are two national exams: the Ethiopian General Secondary Education Certificate Examination (EGSECE), also known as Grade 10 national exam and Grade 12 national exam.[308]\n\n![](image)The Addis Ababa Science Museum of Art and Science serves as the country's biggest hub which showcases the country's newest innovationsToday, there are 30 public universities. Prior to 1991, Ethiopia did not have tertiary institution, but now there are 61 accredited private HEIs. The overall number of tertiary students in both public and private institutions exploded by more than 2,000 percent, from 34,000 in 1991 to 757,000 in 2014, per UIS data.[268] Access to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly. Approximately three million people were in primary school in 1994–95 but by 2008–09, primary enrolment had risen to 15.5 million – an increase of over 500%.[309] In 2013–14, Ethiopia had witnessed a significant boost in gross enrolment across all regions.[310] The national GER was 104.8% for boys, 97.8% for girls and 101.3% across both sexes.[311]\n\n\nThe literacy rate has increased in recent years: according to the 1994 census, the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 23.4%.[276] In 2007 it was estimated to be 39% (male 49.1% and female 28.9%).[312] A report by UNDP in 2011 showed that the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 46.7%. The same report also indicated that the female literacy rate had increased from 27 to 39 per cent from 2004 to 2011, and the male literacy rate had increased from 49 to 59 per cent over the same period for persons 10 years and older.[313] By 2015, the literacy rate had further increased, to 49.1% (57.2% male and 41.1% female).[314]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Cultural performance in Addis Ababa\nEthiopia's rich and diverse culture heavily influenced by the local population, an interaction of Semitic, Cushitic and less populous Nilo-Saharan speaking people, which evolved from first millennium BC. Semitic Tigrayans and Amharas, who dominated the politics in the past, distinguished from other population by hierarchical structure and agrarian life derived partly from South Arabia as a result of back migration, while the southern Cushitic (Oromo and Somali) are strong adherents to egalitarianism and pastoral life. Others including Kaffa, Sidamo, and Afar tradition derived from the latter people.[315]\n\n\nThe most common recognized culture observed in coffee ceremony. Unlike most countries, coffee is served in presence of social gathering, in family, friend or neighborhood level. There are three rounds of coffee drinking: the first one called \"awol\" (Tigrinya: ኣዎል), the second \"tona\" (ቶና) and the third \"baraka\" (ባርካ). The tradition of coffee legend goes back to Kaldi, a goat herder from Keffa Zone who noticed his goat was caught up with hysteria after they eat shrub that stimulate them to dance uncontrollably with rampant. After holding berries, he was advised exhibit to priests in nearby monastery. One monk called the generosity of Kaldi \"the Devil work\" and tossed to the fire, generating aromatic odor. The legend told that Kaldi lived in 850 CE, commonly associated with belief of starting coffee cultivation in Ethiopia in the 9th century.[249]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian art\n\n![](image)An Orthodox bible dated at least 1,500 Years, being the oldest illustrating bible in the world, depicts Corinthian pillars\nArts of Ethiopia were largely influenced by Christian iconography throughout much of its history. This consisted of illuminated manuscripts, painting, crosses, icons and other metalwork such as crowns. Most historical arts were commissioned by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the state religion for a millennium. The earlier Aksumite period arts were stone carvings as evidenced in their stelae, though there is no surviving Christian art from this era. As Christianity was introduced, its iconography was partly influenced by Byzantine art. Most remaining arts beyond the early modern period were ruined as a result of invasion of the Adal Sultanate in the Ethiopian Highlands, but were revived by Catholic emissaries. The Western intervention in Ethiopian art began in the 20th century, with also maintaining traditional Ethiopian character.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)The Axumite Stella's in the Northern Part of Ethiopia dating well over a thousand year's serve as a remembrance of Ethiopia's past architecture.\nThe \"Bete Medhane Alem\" or \"House of our Saviour\" is one of the 12 churches in Lalibela built under Emperor Lalibela IPerhaps the most impressive architecture in antiquity was founded during Dʿmt period. Ashlar masonry was an archetype of South Arabian architecture with most architectural structure similarity.[316]\n\n\nThe Aksumite continued to flourish its architecture around the 4th century CE. Aksumite stelae commonly used single block and rocks. The Tomb of the False Door built for Aksumite emperors used monolithic style.[317] The Lalibela civilization was largely of Aksumite influence, but the layer of stones or wood is quite different for some dwelling.[318]\n\n\nIn Gondarine period, the architecture of Ethiopia was infused by Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian styles independently taught by Portuguese emissaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Example includes the imperial fortress Fasil Ghebbi, which is influenced by either of these styles. The medieval architecture also forborne the later 19th- and 20th-century era of designations.[319]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian philosophy\n\nEthiopian philosophy has been superlatively prolific since ancient times in Africa, though offset of Greek and Patristic philosophy. The best known philosophical revival was in the early modern period figures such as Zera Yacob (1599–1692) and his student Walda Heywat, who wrote *Hatata* (*Inquiry*) in 1667 as an argument for the existence of God.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian literature\n\n![](image)Giyorgis of Segla, prolific religious author in the Late Middle Ages\nThe Ethiopian literature traced back to the Aksumite period in the 4th century, most of them are merely religious motifs. In royal inscription, they employed both Ge'ez and Greek language, but the latter was dismissed in 350. Unlike most Sub-Saharan African countries, Ethiopia has ancient distinct language, the Ge'ez, which dominated political and educational aspects. In spite of the current political instability in the country instigates endangering cultural heritage of these works, some improvements are made for preservation in recent years.[320]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian literary works mostly consisted of handwritten codex (branna, or ብራና in Amharic). It is prepared by gathering parchment leaves and sewing to stick together. The codex size is considerably varies depending on volumes and preparation. For example, pocket size codex lengthens 45 cm, which is heavier in weight. Historians speculated that archaic codex is existed in Ethiopia. Today manuscripts resembling primitive codex are still evident for existence where parchment leaves are convenient for writing.[320]\n\n\nAnother notable writing book is protective (or magic) scroll, serving as written amulet. Some of these were intended for magical purpose, for example *ketab* is used for magical defence. Scrolls typically produced by *debtera*, non-ordained clergy expertise on exorcism and healings. About 30 cm scroll is portable whereas 2 cm is often unrolled and hanged to the wall of house. Scrolls emulating original medium of Ethiopia literature is highly disputed, where there is overwhelming evidence that Ge'ez language books were written in codex. In lesser, Ethiopia used accordion books (called *sensul*) which was dated to late 15th or 16th century, made up of folded parchment paper, with or without cover. Those book usually contain pictorial representation of life and death of religious figures, or significant texts have also juxtaposed.[320]\n\n\n\n#### Poetry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin in 1980s one of Ethiopia's renowned writers\nEthiopia is highly popularized in poetry. Most poets recount past events, social unrests, poverty and famine. *Qene* is the most used element of Ethiopian poetry – regarded as a form of Amharic poetry, though the term generally refers to any poems. True qene requires advanced ingenious mindset. By providing two metaphorical words, i.e. one with obvious clues and the other is too convoluted conundrum, one must answer parallel meanings. Thus, this is called *sem ena work* (gold and wax).[321] The most notable poets are Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin, Kebede Michael and Mengistu Lemma.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethiopian calendar and Oromo calendar\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the Ethiopian calendar, also known as the Ge'ez calendar, and written with the ancient Ge'ez script, one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world.[322] It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six epagomenal days, which form a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLike the Julian calendar, the sixth epagomenal day—which in essence is a leap day—is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. It is approximately seven years and three months behind the Gregorian calendar because of an alternate calculation in determining the date of the Annunciation of Jesus.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the Oromo people. A lunar-stellar calendar, this Oromo calendar relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are *Bittottessa* (Iangulum), *Camsa* (Pleiades), *Bufa* (Aldebarran), *Waxabajjii* (Belletrix), *Obora Gudda* (Central Orion-Saiph), *Obora Dikka* (Sirius), *Birra* (full moon), *Cikawa* (gibbous moon), *Sadasaa* (quarter moon), *Abrasa* (large crescent), *Ammaji* (medium crescent), and *Gurrandala* (small crescent).[323]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian cuisine\n\nSee also: List of Ethiopian dishes and foods\n\n![](image)This meal consisting of *injera* and several kinds of *wat* (stew) is typical of Ethiopian cuisine.\nThe best-known Ethiopian cuisine consists of various types of thick meat stews, known as *wat* in Ethiopian culture, and vegetable side dishes served on top of injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead the injera is used to scoop up the entrées and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the middle of the table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others within a group or own hands—a tradition referred to as \"gursha\".[324] Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as both are forbidden in the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, Islamic and Jewish faiths.\n\n\nChechebsa, Marqa, Chukko, Michirra and Dhanga are the most popular dishes from the Oromo. Kitfo, which originated among the Gurage, is one of the country's most popular delicacies. In addition, *Doro Wot* (ዶሮ ወጥ in Amharic) and Tsebehi Derho (ጽብሒ ድርሆ in Tigrinya), are other popular dishes, originating from northwestern Ethiopia.[*citation needed*] Tihlo (ጥሕሎ)—which is a type of dumpling—is prepared from roasted barley flour and originated in the Tigray Region. Tihlo is now very popular in Amhara and spreading further south.[325]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Communications in Ethiopia and Media in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)The Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation former headquarters in Addis Ababa\nThe Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), formerly known as ETV, is the state media. Radio broadcasting was commenced earlier in 1935 before the television service began in 1962 with assistance of British firm Thomson and Emperor Haile Selassie.[3] Since 2015, EBC has upgraded its studios with modernized transmission.\n\n\nKana TV is the most popular TV channel in Ethiopia.[326] It is mainly known for dubbing foreign content into Amharic. Over several decades, the state television has served as the major mass media until in the late 2000s, when EBS TV launched as the first private television channel. Moreover, numerous private channels were commenced in 2016, culminating in the growth of privately owned media companies in the country. As an example, Fana TV has been the largest TV network since its launch in 2017.\n\n\nThe most widely circulated newspapers in Ethiopia are Addis Fortune, Capital Ethiopia, Ethiopian Reporter, Addis Zemen[*citation needed*] (*Amharic*) and Ethiopian Herald.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe sole internet service provider is the national telecommunications firm Ethio telecom. A large portion of users in the country access the internet through mobile devices.[327] As of July 2016[update], there are around 4.29 million people who have internet access at their home as compared to a quarter of a million users a decade before that.[328] The Ethiopian government has at times intentionally shut down internet service in the country or restricted access to certain social media sites during periods of political unrest. In August 2016, following protest and demonstration in the Oromia Region, all access to the internet was shut down for a period of two days.[329] In June 2017, the government shut down access to the internet for mobile users during a period that coincided with the administration of university entrance examination. Although the reason for the restriction was not confirmed by the government,[327] the move was similar to a measure taken during the same period in 2016, after a leak of test questions.[330][331]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Ethiopia\n\nSee also: List of Ethiopian scientists\n\n![](image)\nPathobiologist Aklilu Lemma. In 1964, he discovered an alternative treatment for schistosomiasis, known as snail fever.[332]\n![](image)\nPaleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged in 2013. He was best known for discovering fossilized hominin called *Selam* or \"Lucy's baby\" in December 2000.[333]\n\nScience and technology in Ethiopia emerging as progressive due to lack of organized institutions. Manufacturing and service providers often place themselves in competitive programming in order to advance innovative and technological solutions through in-house arenas. The Ethiopian Space Science and Technology is responsible for conducting multifaceted tasks regarding space and technology. In addition, Ethiopia also launched 70 kg ET-RSS1 multi-spectral remote sensing satellite in December 2019. The President Sahle-Work Zewde told prior in October 2019 that \"the satellite will provide all the necessary data on changes in climate and weather-related phenomena that would be used for the country's key targets in agriculture, forestry as well as natural resources protection initiatives.\" By January 2020, satellite manufacturing, assembling, integrating and testing began. This would also incremented facility built by French company funded by European Investment Bank (EIB). The main observatory Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center (EORC) allocated space programmes. The Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute is a part of Scientific Research & Development Services Industry, responsible for environmental and climate conservation.[334] Numerous profound scientists have contributed degree of honours and reputations. Some are Kitaw Ejigu, Mulugeta Bekele, Aklilu Lemma, Gebisa Ejeta and Melaku Worede.\n\n\nEthiopia is known for use of traditional medicine since millennia. The first epidemic occurred in Ethiopia was in 849, causing the Aksumite Emperor Abba Yohannes evicted from place due to \"God's punishment for misdeeds\". The first traditional medicine was claimed to be derived from this catastrophe, but the exact source is debated. Though differ from ethnic groups, traditional medicine often implements herbs, spiritual healing, bone-setting and minor surgical procedures in treating disease.[335] Others fields include conventional mathematics used to measure astrology, calendar and unit of measurement.\n\n\nEthiopia was ranked 125th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[336]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Ethiopian Golden Age of music\n\n![](image)Yared in a piece of 15th century Ethiopian sacred art holding a mequamia (prayer stick)\nThe music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Ethiopian music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes. As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighbouring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, and Sudan.[337][338] Traditional singing in Ethiopia presents diverse styles of polyphony, (heterophony, drone, imitation, and counterpoint). Traditionally, lyricism in Ethiopian song writing is strongly associated with views of patriotism or national pride, romance, friendship, and a unique type of memoire known as *tizita*.\n\n\nSaint Yared, a 6th-century Aksumite composer, is widely regarded as the forerunner of traditional music of Eritrea and Ethiopia, creating liturgical music of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. He also composed *Zema*, subdivided into three chants: Ge'ez, Ezel and Araray. Yared life thought to have been \"failure and success\" where his was poor performance in education. Yared then fired from the school and went to his uncle birthplace Murade Qal. There his saw caterpillar endeavours to reach a tree's peak. He epitomized to his real life and returned to the school with good spirit, later became prominent to political sphere. During the remaining of his lifetime, he was a friend of Aksumite Emperor Gebre Meskel and the exiled Nine Saints.[339]\n\n\nModern music traced back to the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, where 40 Armenian orphans called Arba Lijoch arrived from Jerusalem to Addis Ababa. By 1924, the band was almost established as orchestral; but after World War II, several similar bands emerged such as Imperial Bodyguard Band, Army Band, and Police Band.[340]\n\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, traditional infused modern Ethiopian music was revived in what is known as the \"Golden Age\". Several notable musical artists emerged thereafter, for example, Tilahun Gessesse, Alemayehu Eshete, Bizunesh Bekele, Muluken Melesse and Mahmoud Ahmed. It also employed tradition style called *tizita*. During the Derg regime, these artists were prohibited to perform in the country and often forced into exile in North America and Europe, mixing with jazz and funk influences. For example, Roha Band, Walias Band, and Ethio Stars. By this time, Neway Debebe was critical of the Derg government.[321]\n\n\nModern music became developed shortly in the 1990s and 2000s. In this period, the most popular artists were Aster Aweke, Gigi and Teddy Afro. Ethiopian music further modernized in the next decade, employing electronic type and more popular. DJ Rophnan was renowned for pioneering EDM after releasing his debut album *Reflection* in 2018.[321]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Ethiopia\n![](image)\nRuth Negga is an Ethiopian-born actress\n\nThe first cinema was introduced in 1898, three years after the first world film was projected. Cinematic artifacts ascribed by Italian minister Federico Ciccodicola [it] which then offered to Emperor Menelik II. The early 20th century appearance with spectacle was around 1909 and embraced by documentary or biographical films. *Au de Menilek* was the first film directed by Charles Martel. The first 16mm black-and-white film dedicated to coronation of Emperor Zewditu, then coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie was filmed. The 1990s saw international booming of Ethiopian films. The most influential people in this era were Haile Gerima, Salem Mekuria, Yemane Demissie, and Teshome Gabriel. Films began modernized in the 2000s and implemented Amharic language. The most internationally grossed films are *Selanchi*, *Difret*, *Lamb*, *Prince of Love* and *Lambadina*. The modern era saw several reoccurring actors including Selam Tesfaye, Fryat Yemane, Hanan Tarik, Mahder Assefa, Amleset Muchie and Ruth Negga.\n\n\nOne of the most prestigious film award is Gumma Film Awards held in Addis Ababa. The award, which was started in 2014, broadcast on live television in some stations.[341] Festivals including Addis International Film Festival and the Ethiopian International Film Festival showcase amateur and professional filmmakers works; the latter being voted by judges. They were established in 2007[342] and 2005 respectively.[343]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Abebe Bikila, Ethiopia's first Olympic gold medalists\nThe main sports in Ethiopia are track and field (particularly long distance running) and football. Ethiopian athletes have won many Olympic gold medals in track and field, most of them in long distance running.[344] Abebe Bikila became the first athlete from a Sub-Saharan country to win an Olympic gold medal when he won the Marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games in a world record time of 2:15:16.[345][346] Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele, and Tirunesh Dibaba are all world-renowned long distance runners, each with multiple Olympic and World Championship gold medals. Letesenbet Gidey holds the world records in both the women's 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre run. Other notable Ethiopian runners are Mamo Wolde, Miruts Yifter, Derartu Tulu, Meseret Defar, Birhane Adere, Tiki Gelana, Genzebe Dibaba, Tariku Bekele, Gelete Burka, and Yomif Kejelcha.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update] and going into 2013, the current national Ethiopian national football team (nicknamed the Walayia Antelopes) made history by qualifying for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations and reached the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Noted players include captain Adane Girma and top scorer Saladin Said.\n\n\nEthiopia has Sub-Saharan Africa's longest basketball tradition as it established a national basketball team in 1949.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Index of Ethiopia-related articles\n* Outline of Ethiopia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Amharic: ኢትዮጵያ, romanized: *Ītyōṗṗyā* pronounced [i.tjo.p’ja], Oromo: *Itiyoophiyaa*, Somali: *Itoobiya*, Tigrinya: ኢትዮጵያ, romanized: *Ítiyop'iya*, Afar: *Itiyoppiya*\n2. **^** It is also bordered to the northeast by the unrecognised state of Somaliland, which is recognised internationally as a *de jure* autonomous region of Somalia.\n3. **^** The inscriptions in Ancient Greek read \"ΑΧΩΜΙΤΩ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ\" (\"King of Axum\") and \"ΕΝΔΥΒΙΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ\" (\"King Endubis\"); Greek was the *lingua franca* by that time, so its use in coins simplified foreign trade.\n4. **^** \n\n\t* **Pro-federal government troops**\n\t\t+ Ethiopian federal government and regional allies\n\t\t+ Eritrean Defence Forces\n\t\t+ Ethiopian federal government and Eritrean Defence Forces\n\t* **Anti-federal government rebels**\n\t\t+ Oromo Liberation Army\n\t\t+ Fano (Amhara militia)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ethiopia to Add 4 more Official Languages to Foster Unity\". *Ventures Africa*. 4 March 2020.

The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city is Tegucigalpa.\n\n\nHonduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures, most notably the Maya, before the Spanish colonization in the sixteenth century. The Spanish introduced Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language, along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture. Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. In 1960, the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice.[8]\n\n\nThe nation's economy is primarily agricultural, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998.[9] The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country's urban centers.[10] Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625, classifying it as a nation with medium development.[11] When adjusted for income inequality, its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443.[11]\n\n\nHonduran society is predominantly Mestizo; however, there are also significant Indigenous Americans, black and white communities in Honduras.[12] The nation had a relatively high political stability until its 2009 coup and again with the 2017 presidential election.[13]\n\n\nHonduras spans about 112,492 km2 (43,433 sq mi) and has a population exceeding 10 million.[14][15] Its northern portions are part of the western Caribbean zone, as reflected in the area's demographics and culture. Honduras is known for its rich natural resources, including minerals, coffee, tropical fruit, and sugar cane, as well as for its growing textiles industry, which serves the international market.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe literal meaning of the term \"Honduras\" is \"depths\" in Spanish. The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, *fondura* in the Leonese dialect of Spain, or to Columbus's alleged quote that *\"Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas honduras\"* (\"Thank God we have departed from those depths\").[16][17][18]\n\n\nIt was not until the end of the 16th century that *Honduras* was used for the whole province. Prior to 1580, *Honduras* referred to only the eastern part of the province, and *Higueras* referred to the western part.[18] Another early name is Guaymuras, revived as the name for the political dialogue in 2009 that took place in Honduras as opposed to Costa Rica.[19]\n\n\nHondurans are often referred to as *Catracho* or *Catracha* (fem) in Spanish.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Honduras\n\n![](image)A Maya stela, an emblematic symbol of the Honduran Mayan civilization at Copan\n### Pre-colonial period[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mesoamerican chronology\n\nSee also: Bajo Aguán\n\nIn the pre-Columbian era, modern Honduras was split between two pan-cultural regions: Mesoamerica in the west and the Isthmo-Colombian area in the east. Each complex had a \"core area\" within Honduras (the Sula Valley for Mesoamerica, and La Mosquitia for the Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition. However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas. The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire).\n\n\nIn the extreme west, Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Copán, which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas. Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.[20]\n\n\nHowever, Copán represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history. Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country. Archaeologists have studied sites such as Naco [es] and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, Los Naranjos on Lake Yojoa, Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley,[21] La Ceiba and Salitron Viejo[22] (both now under the Cajón Dam reservoir), Selin Farm and Cuyamel in the Aguan valley, Cerro Palenque, Travesia, Curruste, Ticamaya, Despoloncal, and Playa de los Muertos in the lower Ulúa River valley, and many others.\n\n\nIn 2012, LiDAR scanning revealed that several previously unknown high density settlements existed in La Mosquitia, corresponding to the legend of \"La Ciudad Blanca\". Excavation and study has since improved knowledge of the region's history. It is estimated that these settlements reached their zenith from 500 to 1000 AD.\n\n\n\n### Spanish conquest (1524–1539)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish conquest of Honduras\n\n![](image)Hernán Cortés, one of the conquerors of Honduras\nOn his fourth and the final voyage to the New World in 1502, Christopher Columbus landed near the modern town of Trujillo, near Guaimoreto Lagoon, becoming the first European to visit the Bay Islands on the coast of Honduras.[23] On 30 July 1502, Columbus sent his brother Bartholomew to explore the islands and Bartholomew encountered a Mayan trading vessel from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo.[24][25] Bartholomew's men stole the cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's elderly captain to serve as an interpreter[25] in the first recorded encounter between the Spanish and the Maya.[26]\n\n\nIn March 1524, Gil González Dávila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador.[27][28] followed by Hernán Cortés, who had brought forces down from Mexico. Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal to Francisco de Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado.[*who?*] In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.\n\n\nResistance to conquest was led in particular by Lempira. Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the Miskito Kingdom. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the Kingdom of Guatemala. Trujillo and Gracias were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.\n\n\n\n### Spanish Honduras (1524–1821)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Church of San Manuel de Colohete\nHonduras was organized as a province of the Kingdom of Guatemala and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at Comayagua, and finally at Tegucigalpa in the central part of the country.\n\n\nSilver mining was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.[29] Initially the mines were worked by local people through the encomienda system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in. When local slave trading stopped at the end of the sixteenth century, African slaves, mostly from Angola, were imported.[30] After about 1650, very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in Honduras.\n\n\nAlthough the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly, they were less successful on the northern, or Atlantic side. They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at Puerto Caballos and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The Miskito Kingdom in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of Jamaica, which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.\n### Independence (1821)[edit]\n\n\nHonduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the First Mexican Empire until 1823, when it became part of the United Provinces of Central America. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842–1845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849–1852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.\n\n\nPolicies favoring international trade and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, Tegucigalpa, ran out of money when it reached San Pedro Sula. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. Comayagua was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.\n\n\nSince independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of régime.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### 20th century and the role of American companies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Banana Wars\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in banana plantations and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the Cuyamel Fruit Company, as well as the United Fruit Company, and Standard Fruit Company, built an enclave economy in northern Honduras, controlling infrastructure and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth. American troops landed in Honduras in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.[33]\n\n\nIn 1904, the writer O. Henry coined the term \"banana republic\" to describe Honduras,[34] publishing a book called *Cabbages and Kings*, about a fictional country, Anchuria, inspired by his experiences in Honduras, where he had lived for six months.[35] In *The Admiral*, O.Henry refers to the nation as a \"small maritime banana republic\"; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy.[36][37] According to a literary analyst writing for *The Economist*, \"his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical, agrarian country. But its real meaning is sharper: it refers to the fruit companies from the United States that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors.\"[38][39] In addition to drawing Central American workers north, the fruit companies encouraged immigration of workers from the English-speaking Caribbean, notably Jamaica and Belize, which introduced an African-descended, English-speaking and largely Protestant population into the country, although many of these workers left following changes to immigration law in 1939.[40]\nHonduras joined the Allied Nations after Pearl Harbor, on 8 December 1941, and signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, along with twenty-five other governments.\n\n\nConstitutional crises in the 1940s led to reforms in the 1950s. One reform gave workers permission to organize, and a 1954 general strike paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months, but led to reforms. In 1963 a military coup unseated democratically elected President Ramón Villeda Morales. In 1960, the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice.[8]\n\n\n\n### War and upheaval (1969–1999)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1969, Honduras and El Salvador fought what became known as the Football War.[41] Border tensions led to acrimony between the two countries after Oswaldo López Arellano, the president of Honduras, blamed the deteriorating Honduran economy on immigrants from El Salvador. The relationship reached a low when El Salvador met Honduras for a three-round football elimination match preliminary to the World Cup.[42]\n\n\nTensions escalated and on 14 July 1969, the Salvadoran army invaded Honduras.[41] The Organization of American States (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on 20 July and brought about a withdrawal of Salvadoran troops in early August.[42] Contributing factors to the conflict were a boundary dispute and the presence of thousands of Salvadorans living in Honduras illegally. After the week-long war, as many as 130,000 Salvadoran immigrants were expelled.[10]\n\n\nHurricane Fifi caused severe damage when it skimmed the northern coast of Honduras on 18 and 19 September 1974. Melgar Castro (1975–78) and Paz Garcia (1978–82) largely built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system of Honduras.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Part of the massive damage caused by Hurricane Mitch in Tegucigalpa, 1998\nIn 1979, the country returned to civilian rule. A constituent assembly was popularly elected in April 1980 to write a new constitution, and general elections were held in November 1981. The constitution was approved in 1982 and the PLH government of Roberto Suazo won the election with a promise to carry out an ambitious program of economic and social development to tackle the recession in which Honduras found itself. He launched ambitious social and economic development projects sponsored by American development aid. Honduras became host to the largest Peace Corps mission in the world, and nongovernmental and international voluntary agencies proliferated. The Peace Corps withdrew its volunteers in 2012, citing safety concerns.[44]\n\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the United States established a continuing military presence in Honduras to support El Salvador, the Contra guerrillas fighting the Nicaraguan government, and also develop an airstrip and modern port in Honduras. Though spared the bloody civil wars wracking its neighbors, the Honduran army quietly waged campaigns against Marxist–Leninist militias such as the Cinchoneros Popular Liberation Movement, notorious for kidnappings and bombings,[45] and against many non-militants as well. The operation included a campaign of extrajudicial killings by government units, most notably the CIA-trained Battalion 316.[46]\n\n\nIn 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused massive and widespread destruction. Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the country's crops and an estimated 70–80% of the transportation infrastructure, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads. Across Honduras 33,000 houses were destroyed, and an additional 50,000 damaged. Some 5,000 people killed, and 12,000 more injured. Total losses were estimated at US$3 billion.[47]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ricardo Maduro with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in August 2003\nIn 2007, President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya and President of the United States George W. Bush began talks on US assistance to Honduras to tackle the latter's growing drug cartels in Mosquito, Eastern Honduras using US special forces. This marked the beginning of a new foothold for the US military's continued presence in Central America.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)2009 Honduran coup d'état\nUnder Zelaya, Honduras joined ALBA in 2008, but withdrew in 2010 after the 2009 Honduran coup d'état.[49] In 2009, a constitutional crisis resulted when power was transferred in a coup from the president to the head of Congress. The OAS suspended Honduras because it did not regard its government as legitimate.[50][51]\n\n\nCountries around the world, the OAS, and the United Nations[52] formally and unanimously condemned the action as a coup d'état, refusing to recognize the *de facto* government, even though the lawyers consulted by the Library of Congress submitted to the United States Congress an opinion that declared the coup legal.[52][53][54] The Honduran Supreme Court also ruled that the proceedings had been legal. The government that followed the *de facto government* established a truth and reconciliation commission, *Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación*, which after more than a year of research and debate concluded that the ousting had been a coup d'état, and illegal in the commission's opinion.[55][56][57]\n\n\nOn 28 November 2021, the former first lady Xiomara Castro, leftist presidential candidate of opposition Liberty and Refoundation Party, won 53% of the votes in the presidential election to become the first female president of Honduras, bringing an end to the 12-year reign of the right-wing National Party.[58] She was sworn in on 27 January 2022. Her husband, Manuel Zelaya, held the same office from 2006 until 2009.[59]\n\n\nIn April 2022, former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who served two terms between 2014 and January 2022, was extradited to the United States to face charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Hernandez denied the accusations.[60]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Honduras\n\n![](image)Honduras's topography.\nThe north coast of Honduras borders the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean lies south through the Gulf of Fonseca. Honduras consists mainly of mountains, with narrow plains along the coasts. A large undeveloped lowland jungle, *La Mosquitia* lies in the northeast, and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest. In La Mosquitia lies the UNESCO world-heritage site Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, with the Coco River which divides Honduras from Nicaragua.\n\n\nThe Islas de la Bahía and the Swan Islands are off the north coast. Misteriosa Bank and Rosario Bank, 130 to 150 kilometres (81 to 93 miles) north of the Swan Islands, fall within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Honduras.\n\n\nNatural resources include timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, antimony, coal, fish, shrimp, and hydropower.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of Honduras\nMain article: Geography of Honduras § Climate\n\nThe climate varies from tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains. The Pacific coast is generally drier than the Caribbean.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flora and Fauna of Honduras\n\nSee also: List of birds of Honduras and List of national parks of Honduras\n\nThe region is considered a biodiversity hotspot because of the many plant and animal species found there. Like other countries in the region, it contains vast biological resources. Honduras hosts more than 6,000 species of vascular plants, of which 630 (described so far) are orchids; around 250 reptiles and amphibians, more than 700 bird species, and 110 mammalian species, of which half are bats.[61]\n\n\nIn the northeastern region of La Mosquitia lies the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, a lowland rainforest which is home to a great diversity of life. The reserve was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List in 1982.\n\n\nHonduras has rain forests, cloud forests (which can rise up to nearly 3,000 metres or 9,800 feet above sea level), mangroves, savannas and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. In the Bay Islands there are bottlenose dolphins, manta rays, parrot fish, schools of blue tang and whale shark.\n\n\nDeforestation resulting from logging is rampant in Olancho Department. The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped La Mosquitia region, causing land degradation and soil erosion. Honduras had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.48/10, ranking it 126th globally out of 172 countries.[62]\n\n\nLake Yojoa, which is Honduras's largest source of fresh water, is polluted by heavy metals produced from mining activities.[63] Some rivers and streams are also polluted by mining.[64]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Honduras\n\nHonduras is governed within a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic. The President of Honduras is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the Honduran government. Legislative power is vested in the National Congress of Honduras. The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch and the legislature.\n\n\nThe National Congress of Honduras (*Congreso Nacional*) has 128 members (*diputados*), elected for a four-year term by proportional representation. Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates on a departmental basis in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.[1]\n\n\n\n### Political culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Incumbent President Xiomara Castro\nIn 1963, a military coup removed the democratically elected president, Ramón Villeda Morales. A string of authoritarian military governments held power uninterrupted until 1981, when Roberto Suazo Córdova was elected president.\n\n\nThe party system was dominated by the conservative National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) and the liberal Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) until the 2009 Honduran coup d'état removed Manuel Zelaya from office and put Roberto Micheletti in his place.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2009 military coup ousted the country's democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya.\nIn late 2012, 1540 persons were interviewed by ERIC in collaboration with the Jesuit university, as reported by Associated Press. This survey found that 60.3% believed the police were involved in crime, 44.9% had \"no confidence\" in the Supreme Court, and 72% thought there was electoral fraud in the primary elections of November 2012. Also, 56% expected the presidential, legislative and municipal elections of 2013 to be fraudulent.[65]\n\n\nThen-president Juan Orlando Hernández took office on 27 January 2014. After managing to stand for a second term,[66] a very close election in 2017 left uncertainty as to whether then-President Hernandez or his main challenger, television personality Salvador Nasralla, had prevailed.[67] The disputed election caused protests and violence. In December 2017, Hernández was declared the winner of the election after a partial recount.[68] In January 2018, Hernández was sworn in for a second presidential term.[69] He was succeeded by Xiomara Castro, the leader of the left-wing Libre Party, and wife of Manuel Zelaya, on 27 January 2022, becoming the first woman to serve as president.[70]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Foreign relations of Honduras\n\n![](image)Map of Honduran diplomatic missions\n![](image)Map of diplomatic missions in Honduras\nHonduras and Nicaragua had tense relations throughout 2000 and early 2001 due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua imposed a 35% tariff against Honduran goods due to the dispute.[71]\n\n\nIn June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he was taken in a military aircraft to Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya. Several Latin American nations, including Mexico, temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico.[72] The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; U.S. President Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era Ambassador to Honduras implicated in the Iran–Contra affair, refrained from expressing support.[73] She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses.[74] Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.[49]\n\n\nThis interest in regional agreements may have increased the alarm of establishment politicians. When Zelaya began calling for a \"fourth ballot box\" to determine whether Hondurans wished to convoke a special constitutional congress, this sounded a lot to some like the constitutional amendments that had extended the terms of both Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales. \"Chávez has served as a role model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power. These presidents are barely in office when they typically convene a constitutional convention to guarantee their reelection,\" said a 2009 Spiegel International analysis,[75] which noted that one reason to join ALBA was discounted Venezuelan oil. In addition to Chávez and Morales, Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Columbian President Álvaro Uribe had all taken this step, and Washington and the EU were both accusing the Sandinista National Liberation Front government in Nicaragua of tampering with election results.[75] Politicians of all stripes expressed opposition to Zelaya's referendum proposal, and the Attorney-General accused him of violating the constitution. The Honduran Supreme Court agreed, saying that the constitution had put the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in charge of elections and referenda, not the National Statistics Institute, which Zelaya had proposed to have run the count.[76] Whether or not Zelaya's removal from power had constitutional elements, the Honduran constitution explicitly protects all Hondurans from forced expulsion from Honduras.\n\n\nThe United States maintains a small military presence at one Honduran base. The two countries conduct joint peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, humanitarian, disaster relief, humanitarian, medical and civic action exercises. U.S. troops conduct and provide logistics support for a variety of bilateral and multilateral exercises. The United States is Honduras's chief trading partner.[43]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Armed Forces of Honduras\n\nHonduras has a military with the Honduran Army, Honduran Navy and Honduran Air Force.\n\n\nIn 2017, Honduras signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[77]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Departments of Honduras and Municipalities of Honduras\n\n![](image)The departmental divisions of Honduras\nHonduras is divided into 18 departments. The capital city is Tegucigalpa in the Central District within the department of Francisco Morazán.\n\n\n\n1. Atlántida\n2. Choluteca\n3. Colón\n4. Comayagua\n5. Copán\n6. Cortés\n7. El Paraíso\n8.

Yoro\n\n\nA new administrative division called ZEDE (*Zonas de empleo y desarrollo económico*) was created in 2013. ZEDEs have a high level of autonomy with their own political system at a judicial, economic and administrative level, and are based on free market capitalism.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Honduras\nThis section is an excerpt from Economy of Honduras.[edit]\n![](image)San Pedro Sula, industrial center of Honduras\nThe economy of Honduras is based mostly on agriculture, which accounts for 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. The country's leading export is coffee (US$340 million), which accounted for 22% of the total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated shrimp is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through maquiladoras, especially in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortés.[78]\n\n\nHonduras has extensive forests, marine, and mineral resources, although widespread slash and burn agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran forests. The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (−1.9%) of 1999. The Honduran maquiladora sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528  million in foreign exchange for the country. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the United States) rose 28% to $410 million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was devaluing for many years, but stabilized at L19 to the United States dollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.[79]\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer. Using alternative statistical measurements in addition to the gross domestic product can provide greater context for the nation's poverty.\n\n\nThe country signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) – later converted to a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) with the International Monetary Fund in March 1999. Honduras (as of the about year 2000) continues to maintain stable macroeconomic policies. It has not been swift in implementing structural changes, such as privatization of the publicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies—changes which are desired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received significant debt relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, including the suspension of bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by the Paris Club—including the United States – worth over $400  million. In July 2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral debt relief.\n\n\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of apparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty.[80] The country is one of the most unequal in Latin America.[81]\n![](image)Historical GDP per capita development of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nThe World Bank categorizes Honduras as a low middle-income nation.[82] The nation's per capita income sits at around 600 US dollars making it one of the lowest in North America.[83]\n\n\nIn 2010, 50% of the population were living below the poverty line.[84] By 2016 more than 66% were living below the poverty line.[82]\n\n\nEconomic growth in the last few years has averaged 7% a year, one of the highest rates in Latin America (2010).[82] Despite this, Honduras has seen the least development amongst all Central American countries.[85] Honduras is ranked 130 of 188 countries with a Human Development Index of .625 that classifies the nation as having medium development (2015).[11] The three factors that go into Honduras's HDI (an extended and healthy life, accessibility of knowledge and standard of living) have all improved since 1990 but still remain relatively low with life expectancy at birth being 73.3, expected years of schooling being 11.2 (mean of 6.2 years) and GNI per capita being $4,466 (2015).[11] The HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.751 with life expectancy at birth being 68.6, expected years of schooling being 11.5 (mean of 6.6) and GNI per capita being $6,281 (2015).[11]\n\n\nThe 2009 Honduran coup d'état led to a variety of economic trends in the nation.[86] Overall growth has slowed, averaging 5.7 percent from 2006 to 2008 but slowing to 3.5 percent annually between 2010 and 2013.[86] Following the coup trends of decreasing poverty and extreme poverty were reversed. The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.[86] Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.[86]\n\n\nBecause much of the Honduran economy is based on small scale agriculture of only a few exports, natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact. Natural disasters, such as 1998 Hurricane Mitch, have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affect poor rural areas.[87] Additionally, they are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable to provide for their families.[87] A study done by Honduras NGO, World Neighbors, determined the terms \"increased workload, decreased basic grains, expensive food, and fear\" were most associated with Hurricane Mitch.[88]\n\n\nThe rural and urban poor were hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.[87] Those in southern and western regions specifically were considered most vulnerable as they both were subject to environmental destruction and home to many subsistence farmers.[87] Due to disasters such as Hurricane Mitch, the agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years.[87] This is mostly due to a decline in exports, such as bananas and coffee, that were affected by factors such as natural disasters.[87] Indigenous communities along the Patuca River were hit extremely hard as well.[9] The mid-Pataca region was almost completely destroyed.[9] Over 80% of rice harvest and all of banana, plantain, and manioc harvests were lost.[9] Relief and reconstruction efforts following the storm were partial and incomplete, reinforcing existing levels of poverty rather than reversing those levels, especially for indigenous communities.[9] The period between the end of food donations and the following harvest led to extreme hunger, causing deaths amongst the Tawahka population.[9] Those that were considered the most \"land-rich\" lost 36% of their total land on average.[9] Those that were the most \"land-poor\", lost less total land but a greater share of their overall total.[9] This meant that those hit hardest were single women as they constitute the majority of this population.[9]\n\n\n\n### Poverty reduction strategies[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1970s when Honduras was designated a \"food priority country\" by the UN, organizations such as The World Food Program (WFP) have worked to decrease malnutrition and food insecurity.[89] A large majority of Honduran farmers live in extreme poverty, or below 180 US dollars per capita.[90] Currently one fourth of children are affected by chronic malnutrition.[89] WFP is currently working with the Honduran government on a School Feeding Program which provides meals for 21,000 Honduran schools, reaching 1.4 million school children.[89] WFP also participates in disaster relief through reparations and emergency response in order to aid in quick recovery that tackles the effects of natural disasters on agricultural production.[89]\n\n\nHonduras's Poverty Reduction Strategy was implemented in 1999 and aimed to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015.[91] While spending on poverty-reduction aid increased there was only a 2.5% increase in GDP between 1999 and 2002.[92] This improvement left Honduras still below that of countries that lacked aid through Poverty Reduction Strategy behind those without it.[92] The World Bank believes that this inefficiency stems from a lack of focus on infrastructure and rural development.[92] Extreme poverty saw a low of 36.2 percent only two years after the implementation of the strategy but then increased to 66.5 percent by 2012.[86]\n\n\nPoverty Reduction Strategies were also intended to affect social policy through increased investment in education and health sectors.[93] This was expected to lift poor communities out of poverty while also increasing the workforce as a means of stimulating the Honduran economy.[93] Conditional cash transfers were used to do this by the Family Assistance Program.[93] This program was restructured in 1998 in an attempt to increase effectiveness of cash transfers for health and education specifically for those in extreme poverty.[93] Overall spending within Poverty Reduction Strategies have been focused on education and health sectors increasing social spending from 44% of Honduras's GDP in 2000 to 51% in 2004.[93]\n\n\nCritics of aid from International Finance Institutions believe that the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy result in little substantive change to Honduran policy.[93] Poverty Reduction Strategies also excluded clear priorities, specific intervention strategy, strong commitment to the strategy and more effective macro-level economic reforms according to Jose Cuesta of Cambridge University.[92] Due to this he believes that the strategy did not provide a pathway for economic development that could lift Honduras out of poverty resulting in neither lasting economic growth of poverty reduction.[92]\n\n\nPrior to its 2009 coup Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage.[86] Efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup.[86] When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 10.9 recent in 2012.[86] This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession, which the nation was previously relatively well equipped to deal with.[86]\n\n\n\n### Economic inequality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Slum in Tegucigalpa\nLevels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country.[86] Unlike other Latin American countries, inequality steadily increased in Honduras between 1991 and 2005.[91] Between 2006 and 2010 inequality saw a decrease but increased again in 2010.[86]\n\n\nWhen Honduras's Human Development Index is adjusted for inequality (known as the IHDI) Honduras's development index is reduced to .443.[11] The levels of inequality in each aspect of development can also be assessed.[11] In 2015 inequality of life expectancy at birth was 19.6%, inequality in education was 24.4% and inequality in income was 41.5% [11] The overall loss in human development due to inequality was 29.2.[11]\n\n\nThe IHDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.575 with an overall loss of 23.4%.[11] In 2015 for the entire region, inequality of life expectancy at birth was 22.9%, inequality in education was 14.0% and inequality in income was 34.9%.[11] While Honduras has a higher life expectancy than other countries in the region (before and after inequality adjustments), its quality of education and economic standard of living are lower.[11] Income inequality and education inequality have a large impact on the overall development of the nation.[11]\n\n\nInequality also exists between rural and urban areas as it relates to the distribution of resources.[94] Poverty is concentrated in southern, eastern, and western regions where rural and indigenous peoples live. North and central Honduras are home to the country's industries and infrastructure, resulting in low levels of poverty.[83] Poverty is concentrated in rural Honduras, a pattern that is reflected throughout Latin America.[12] The effects of poverty on rural communities are vast. Poor communities typically live in adobe homes, lack material resources, have limited access to medical resources, and live off of basics such as rice, maize and beans.[95]\n\n\nThe lower class predominantly consists of rural subsistence farmers and landless peasants.[96] Since 1965 there has been an increase in the number of landless peasants in Honduras which has led to a growing class of urban poor individuals.[96] These individuals often migrate to urban centers in search of work in the service sector, manufacturing, or construction.[96] Demographers believe that without social and economic reform, rural to urban migration will increase, resulting in the expansion of urban centers.[96] Within the lower class, underemployment is a major issue.[96] Individuals that are underemployed often only work as part-time laborers on seasonal farms meaning their annual income remains low.[96] In the 1980s peasant organizations and labor unions such as the National Federation of Honduran Peasants, The National Association of Honduran Peasants and the National Union of Peasants formed.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)An indigenous family in a small mountain village in Honduras\nIt is not uncommon for rural individuals to voluntarily enlist in the military, however this often does not offer stable or promising career opportunities.[97] The majority of high-ranking officials in the Honduran army are recruited from elite military academies.[97] Additionally, the majority of enlistment in the military is forced.[97] Forced recruitment largely relies on an alliance between the Honduran government, military and upper class Honduran society.[97] In urban areas males are often sought out from secondary schools while in rural areas roadblocks aided the military in handpicking recruits.[97] Higher socio-economic status enables individuals to more easily evade the draft.[97]\n\n\nMiddle class Honduras is a small group defined by relatively low membership and income levels.[96] Movement from lower to middle class is typically facilitated by higher education.[96] Professionals, students, farmers, merchants, business employees, and civil servants are all considered a part of the Honduran middle class.[96] Opportunities for employment and the industrial and commercial sectors are slow-growing, limiting middle class membership.[96]\n\n\nThe Honduran upper class has much higher income levels than the rest of the Honduran population reflecting large amounts of income inequality.[96] Much of the upper class affords their success to the growth of cotton and livestock exports post-World War II.[96] The wealthy are not politically unified and differ in political and economic views.[96]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)San Pedro Sula is a major center of business and commerce in Honduras, and is home to many large manufacturers and companies. It is often referred to as \"La Capital Industrial\".[98]\nThe currency is the Honduran lempira.\n\n\nThe government operates both the electrical grid, Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica (ENEE) and the land-line telephone service, Hondutel. ENEE receives heavy subsidies to counter its chronic financial problems, but Hondutel is no longer a monopoly. The telecommunication sector was opened to private investment on 25 December 2005, as required under CAFTA. The price of petroleum is regulated, and the Congress often ratifies temporary price regulation for basic commodities.\n\n\nGold, silver, lead and zinc are mined.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)CAFTA countries\nIn 2005 Honduras signed CAFTA, a free trade agreement with the United States. In December 2005, Puerto Cortés, the primary seaport of Honduras, was included in the U.S. Container Security Initiative.[100]\n\n\nIn 2006 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy announced the first phase of the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI), which built upon existing port security measures. SFI gave the U.S. government enhanced authority, allowing it to scan containers from overseas[*clarification needed*] for nuclear and radiological materials in order to improve the risk assessment of individual US-bound containers. The initial phase of Secure Freight involved deploying of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports:\n\n\n\n* Port Qasim in Pakistan;\n* Puerto Cortés in Honduras;\n* Southampton in the United Kingdom;\n* Port of Salalah in Oman;\n* Port of Singapore;\n* Gamman Terminal at Port Busan, Korea.\n\n\nContainers in these ports have been scanned since 2007 for radiation and other risk factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States.[101]\n\n\nFor economic development a 2012 memorandum of understanding with a group of international investors obtained Honduran government approval to build a zone (city) with its own laws, tax system, judiciary and police, but opponents brought a suit against it in the Supreme Court, calling it a \"state within a state\".[102] In 2013, Honduras's Congress ratified Decree 120, which led to the establishment of ZEDEs. The government began construction of the first zones in June 2015.[103]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Electricity sector in Honduras\n\nAbout half of the electricity sector in Honduras is privately owned. The remaining generation capacity is run by ENEE (*Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica*).\nKey challenges in the sector are:\n\n\n\n* Financing investments in generation and transmission without either a financially healthy utility or concessionary funds from external donors\n* Re-balancing tariffs, cutting arrears and reducing losses, including electricity theft, without social unrest\n* Reconciling environmental concerns with government objectives – two large new dams and associated hydropower plants.\n* Improving access to electricity in rural areas.\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A highway in Honduras\nInfrastructure for transportation in Honduras consists of: 699 kilometres (434 miles) of railways; 13,603 kilometres (8,453 miles) of roadways;[1] six ports;[104] and 112 airports altogether (12 Paved, 100 unpaved).[1] The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPRTRAVI in Spanish acronym) is responsible for transport sector policy.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Honduras\n\nHonduras had a population of 10,278,345 in 2021.[14][15] The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% were between 15 and 65 years old, and 4.3% were 65 years old or older.[105]\n\n\nSince 1975, emigration from Honduras has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better life elsewhere. A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, up from 217,569 in 2000.[106]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nEthnic groups in Honduras %[107]\n\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian and European) (90%)\nAmerindians (7%)\nBlacks (2%)\nWhites (1%)\n\nThe ethnic breakdown of Honduran society was 90% Mestizo, 7% American Indian, 2% Black and 1% White (2017).[12] The 1927 Honduran census provides no racial data but in 1930 five classifications were created: white, Indian, Negro, yellow, and mestizo.[108] This system was used in the 1935 and 1940 census.[108] Mestizo was used to describe individuals that did not fit neatly into the categories of white, American Indian, negro or yellow or who are of mixed white-American Indian descent.[108]\n\n\nJohn Gillin considers Honduras to be one of thirteen \"Mestizo countries\" (Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay).[109] He claims that in much of Spanish America little attention is paid to race and race mixture resulting in social status having little reliance on one's physical features.[109] However, in \"Mestizo countries\" such as Honduras, this is not the case.[109] Social stratification from Spain was able to develop in these countries through colonization.[109]\n\n\nDuring colonization the majority of Honduras's indigenous population died of diseases like smallpox and measles resulting in a more homogenous indigenous population compared to other colonies.[96] Nine indigenous and African groups are recognized by the government in Honduras.[110] The majority of Amerindians in Honduras are Lenca, followed by the Miskito, Cho'rti', Tolupan, Pech and Sumo.[110] Around 50,000 Lenca individuals live in the west and western interior of Honduras while the other small native groups are located throughout the country.[96]\n\n\nThe majority of blacks in Honduras are ladino, meaning they are culturally Latino.[96] Non-ladino groups in Honduras include the Garifuna, Miskito, Bay Island Creoles, and Arab immigrants. [96] The Garifunas descended from freed slaves from the island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.[96] The Bay Island Creoles are the descendants of freed African slaves from the British empire, who administered the Bay Islands from early 17th century to 1850. The Creoles, the Garinagu, and the Miskitos are extremely racially diverse.[96] While the Garinagu and Miskitos have similar origins, Garifunas are considered black while Miskitos are considered indigenous.[96] This is largely a reflection of cultural differences, as Garinagu have retained much of their original African culture.[96] The majority of Arab Hondurans are of Palestinian and Lebanese descent.[96] They are known as \"turcos\" in Honduras because of migration during the rule of the Ottoman Empire.[96] They have maintained cultural distinctiveness and prospered economically.[96]\n\n\n\n### Gender[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Gender inequality in Honduras\n\nThe male to female ratio of the Honduran population is 1.01. This ratio stands at 1.05 at birth, 1.04 from 15 to 24 years old, 1.02 from 25 to 54 years old, .88 from 55 to 64 years old, and .77 for those 65 years or older.[12]\n\n\nThe Gender Development Index (GDI) was .942 in 2015 with an HDI of .600 for females and .637 for males.[11] Life expectancy at birth for males is 70.9 and 75.9 for females.[11] Expected years of schooling in Honduras is 10.9 years for males (mean of 6.1) and 11.6 for females (mean of 6.2).[11] These measures do not reveal a large disparity between male and female development levels, however, GNI per capita is vastly different by gender.[11] Males have a GNI per capita of $6,254 while that of females is only $2,680.[11] Honduras's overall GDI is higher than that of other medium HDI nations (.871) but lower than the overall HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean (.981).[11]\n\n\nThe United Nations Development Program (UNDP) ranks Honduras 116th for measures including women's political power, and female access to resources.[111] The Gender Inequality Index (GII) depicts gender-based inequalities in Honduras according to reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.[11] Honduras has a GII of .461 and ranked 101 of 159 countries in 2015.[11] 25.8% of Honduras's parliament is female and 33.4% of adult females have a secondary education or higher while only 31.1% of adult males do.[11] Despite this, while male participation in the labor market is 84.4, female participation is 47.2%.[11] Honduras's maternal mortality ratio is 129 and the adolescent birth rate is 65.0 for women ages 15–19.[11]\n\n\nFamilialism and machismo carry a lot of weight within Honduran society.[112] Familialism refers to the idea of individual interests being second to that of the family, most often in relation to dating and marriage, abstinence, and parental approval and supervision of dating.[112] Aggression and proof of masculinity through physical dominance are characteristic of machismo.[112]\n\n\nHonduras has historically functioned with a patriarchal system like many other Latin American countries.[113] Honduran men claim responsibility for family decisions including reproductive health decisions.[113] Recently Honduras has seen an increase in challenges to this notion as feminist movements and access to global media increases.[113] There has been an increase in educational attainment, labor force participating, urban migration, late-age marriage, and contraceptive use amongst Honduran women.[113]\n\n\nBetween 1971 and 2001 Honduran total fertility rate decreased from 7.4 births to 4.4 births.[113] This is largely attributable to an increase in educational attainment and workforce participation by women, as well as more widespread use of contraceptives.[113] In 1996 50% of women were using at least one type of contraceptive.[113] By 2001 62% were largely due to female sterilization, birth control in the form of a pill, injectable birth control, and IUDs.[113] A study done in 2001 of Honduran men and women reflect conceptualization of reproductive health and decision making in Honduras.[113] 28% of men and 25% of women surveyed believed men were responsible for decisions regarding family size and family planning uses.[113] 21% of men believed men were responsible for both.[113]\n\n\nSexual violence against women has proven to be a large issue in Honduras that has caused many to migrate to the U.S.[114] The prevalence of child sexual abuse was 7.8% in Honduras with the majority of reports being from children under the age of 11.[115] Women that experienced sexual abuse as children were found to be twice as likely to be in violent relationships.[115] Femicide is widespread in Honduras.[114] In 2014, 40% of unaccompanied refugee minors were female.[114] Gangs are largely responsible for sexual violence against women as they often use sexual violence.[114] Between 2005 and 2013 according to the UN Special Repporteur on Violence Against Women, violent deaths increased 263.4 percent.[114] Impunity for sexual violence and femicide crimes was 95 percent in 2014.[114] Additionally, many girls are forced into human trafficking and prostitution.[114]\n\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997 Honduras recognized domestic violence as both a public health issue and a punishable offense due to efforts by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).[111] PAHO's subcommittee on Women, Health and Development was used as a guide to develop programs that aid in domestic violence prevention and victim assistance programs [111] However, a study done in 2009 showed that while the policy requires health care providers to report cases of sexual violence, emergency contraception, and victim referral to legal institutions and support groups, very few other regulations exist within the realm of registry, examination and follow-up.[116] Unlike other Central American countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, Honduras does not have detailed guidelines requiring service providers to be extensively trained and respect the rights of sexual violence victims.[116] Since the study was done the UNFPA and the Health Secretariat of Honduras have worked to develop and implement improved guidelines for handling cases of sexual violence.[116]\n\n\nAn educational program in Honduras known as *Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial* (SAT) has attempted to \"undo gender\" through focusing on gender equality in everyday interactions.[117] Honduras's SAT program is one of the largest in the world, second only to Colombia's with 6,000 students.[117] It is currently sponsored by *Asociacion Bayan*, a Honduran NGO, and the Honduran Ministry of Education.[117] It functions by integrating gender into curriculum topics, linking gender to the ideas of justice and equality, encouraging reflection, dialogue and debate and emphasizing the need for individual and social change.[117] This program was found to increase gender consciousness and a desire for gender equality amongst Honduran women through encouraging discourse surrounding existing gender inequality in the Honduran communities.[117]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nSpanish is the official, national language, spoken by virtually all Hondurans. In addition to Spanish, a number of indigenous languages are spoken in some small communities. Other languages spoken by some include Honduran sign language and Bay Islands Creole English.[118]\n\n\nThe main indigenous languages are:\n\n\n\n* Garifuna (Arawakan) (almost 100,000 speakers in Honduras including monolinguals)\n* Mískito (Misumalpan) (29,000 speakers in Honduras)\n* Mayangna (Misumalpan) (less than 1000 speakers in Honduras, more in Nicaragua)\n* Pech/Paya, (Chibchan) (less than 1000 speakers)\n* Tol (Jicaquean) (less than 500 speakers)\n* Ch'orti' (Mayan) (less than 50 speakers)\n\n\nThe Lenca isolate lost all its fluent native speakers in the 20th century but is currently undergoing revival efforts among the members of the ethnic population of about 100,000. The largest immigrant languages are Arabic (42,000), Armenian (1,300), Turkish (900), Yue Chinese (1,000).[118]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of cities in Honduras\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in HondurasAccording to the 2013 Census[119]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Department | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Tegucigalpa](image)Tegucigalpa![San Pedro Sula](image)San Pedro Sula | 1 | Tegucigalpa | Francisco Morazán | 996,658\n | ![La Ceiba](image)La Ceiba![Choloma](image)Choloma |\n| 2 | San Pedro Sula | Cortés | 598,519\n |\n| 3 | La Ceiba | Atlántida | 176,212\n |\n| 4 | Choloma | Cortés | 163,818\n |\n| 5 | El Progreso | Yoro | 114,934\n |\n| 6 | Comayagua | Comayagua | 92,883\n |\n| 7 | Choluteca | Choluteca | 86,179\n |\n| 8 | Danlí | El Paraíso | 64,976\n |\n| 9 | La Lima | Cortés | 62,903\n |\n| 10 | Villanueva | Cortés | 62,711\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Honduras\n\nReligions: in Honduras %[107]\n\n\n\nCatholic (46%)\nProtestant (39%)\n\nAlthough most Hondurans are nominally Catholic (which would be considered the main religion), membership in the Catholic Church is declining while membership in Protestant churches is increasing. The International Religious Freedom Report, 2008, notes that a CID Gallup poll reported that 51.4% of the population identified themselves as Catholic, 36.2% as evangelical Protestant, 1.3% claiming to be from other religions, including Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, Rastafarians, etc. and 11.1% do not belong to any religion or unresponsive. 8% reported as being either atheistic or agnostic. Customary Catholic church tallies and membership estimates 81% Catholic where the priest (in more than 185 parishes) is required to fill out a pastoral account of the parish each year.[120][121]\n\n\nThe CIA Factbook lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life notes that: \"It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group.\"[122] Often people attend one church without giving up their \"home\" church. Many who attend evangelical megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[123] This shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[124]\n\n\nMost pollsters suggest an annual poll taken over a number of years would provide the best method of knowing religious demographics and variations in any single country. Still, in Honduras are thriving Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Lutheran, Latter-day Saint (Mormon) and Pentecostal churches. There are Protestant seminaries. The Catholic Church, still the only \"church\" that is recognized, is also thriving in the number of schools, hospitals, and pastoral institutions (including its own medical school) that it operates. Its archbishop, Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodriguez Maradiaga, is also very popular with the government, other churches, and in his own church. Practitioners of the Buddhist, Jewish, Islamic, Baháʼí, Rastafari and indigenous denominations and religions exist.[125]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee Health in Honduras\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Honduras\n\nAbout 83.6% of the population are literate and the net primary enrollment rate was 94% in 2004.[126] In 2014, the primary school *completion* rate was 90.7%.[127] Honduras has bilingual (Spanish and English) and even trilingual (Spanish with English, Arabic, or German) schools and numerous universities.[128]\n\n\nThe higher education is governed by the National Autonomous University of Honduras which has centers in the most important cities of Honduras. Hondura was ranked 116th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[129]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Honduras\n\nCrime in Honduras is rampant and criminals operate with a high degree of impunity. Honduras has one of the highest national murder rates in the world; cities such as San Pedro Sula and the Tegucigalpa likewise have registered homicide rates among the highest in the world. The violence is associated with drug trafficking as Honduras is often a transit point, and with a number of urban gangs, mainly the MS-13 and the 18th Street gang. Homicide violence reached a peak in 2012 with an average of 20 homicides a day.[130] Official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on National Violence show Honduras's homicide rate was 60 per 100,000 in 2015 with the majority of homicide cases unprosecuted.[131] But as recently as 2017, organizations such as InSight Crime's show figures of 42 per 100,000 inhabitants,[132] a 26% drop from 2016 figures.\n\n\nHighway assaults and carjackings at roadblocks or checkpoints set up by criminals with police uniforms and equipment occur frequently. Although reports of kidnappings of foreigners are not common, families of kidnapping victims often pay ransoms without reporting the crime to police out of fear of retribution, so kidnapping figures may be underreported.[131]\n\n\nViolence in Honduras increased after Plan Colombia was implemented and after Mexican President Felipe Calderón declared the war against drug trafficking in Mexico.[133] Along with neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala, Honduras forms part of the Northern Triangle of Central America, which has been characterized as one of the most violent regions in the world.[134] As a result of crime and increasing murder rates, the flow of migrants from Honduras to the U.S. also went up. The rise in violence in the region has received international attention.\n\n\nOwing to measures taken by government and business in 2014 to improve tourist safety, Roatan and the Bay Islands have lower crime rates than the Honduran mainland.[131]\n\n\nIn the less populated region of Gracias a Dios, narcotics-trafficking is rampant and police presence is scarce. Threats against U.S. citizens by drug traffickers and other criminal organizations have resulted in the U.S. Embassy placing restrictions on the travel of U.S. officials through the region.[131]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Other important painters include Carlos Garay, and Roque Zelaya. Some of Honduras's most notable writers are Lucila Gamero de Medina, Froylán Turcios, Ramón Amaya Amador and Juan Pablo Suazo Euceda, Marco Antonio Rosa,[135] Roberto Sosa, Eduardo Bähr, Amanda Castro, Javier Abril Espinoza, Teófilo Trejo, and Roberto Quesada.\n\n\nThe José Francisco Saybe theater in San Pedro Sula is home to the Círculo Teatral Sampedrano (Theatrical Circle of San Pedro Sula)\n\n\nHonduras has experienced a boom from its film industry for the past two decades. Since the premiere of the movie \"Anita la cazadora de insectos\" in 2001, the level of Honduran productions has increased, many collaborating with countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and the U.S. The most well known Honduran films are \"El Xendra\", \"Amor y Frijoles\", and \"Cafe con aroma a mi tierra\".\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Honduran cuisine\n\nHonduran cuisine is a fusion of indigenous Lenca cuisine, Spanish cuisine, Caribbean cuisine and African cuisine. There are also dishes from the Garifuna people. Coconut and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include fried fish, tamales, carne asada and baleadas.\n\n\nOther popular dishes include: meat roasted with chismol and carne asada, chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalapeños. Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal areas and in the Bay Islands involve coconut milk.\n\n\nThe soups Hondurans enjoy include bean soup, mondongo soup (tripe soup), seafood soups and beef soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with plantains, yuca, and cabbage, and served with corn tortillas.\n\n\nOther typical dishes are the montucas or corn tamales, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in plantain leaves. Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as papaya, pineapple, plum, sapote, passion fruit and bananas which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Media of Honduras\n\nAt least half of Honduran households have at least one television. Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras's main newspapers are La Prensa, El Heraldo, La Tribuna and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper is La Gaceta (Honduras) [es].\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Honduras\n\nPunta is the main music of Honduras, with other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, merengue, reggae, and reggaeton all widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican rancheras heard in the rural interior of the country. The most well known musicians are Guillermo Anderson and Polache. Banda Blanca is a widely known music group in both Honduras and internationally.\n\n\n\n### Celebrations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Public holidays in Honduras\n\n![](image)Sawdust carpets of Comayagua during Easter celebrations\nSome of Honduras's national holidays include Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or Día del Niño, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have piñatas on the street. Other holidays are Easter, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Day of the Soldier (3 October to celebrate the birth of Francisco Morazán), Christmas, El Dia de Lempira on 20 July,[136] and New Year's Eve.\n\n\nHonduras Independence Day festivities start early in the morning with marching bands. Each band wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as beans, tamales, baleadas, cassava with chicharrón, and tortillas are offered.\n\n\nOn Christmas Eve people reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and \"cohetes\", fireworks and festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include piñatas filled with candies and surprises for the children.\n\n\nLa Ceiba Carnival is celebrated in La Ceiba, a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint Saint Isidore. People from all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans come to show off their farm products and animals.\n\n\n\n### National symbols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The national bird, *Ara macao*\nThe flag of Honduras is composed of three equal horizontal stripes. The blue upper and lower stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the Central American Union. The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.\n\n\nThe coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: \"Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent\".\n\n\nThe \"National Anthem of Honduras\" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of Manuel Bonilla. In the end, it was the poet Augusto Coello that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer Carlos Hartling writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of Alberto de Jesús Membreño [es]. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nThe national flower is the famous orchid, *Rhyncholaelia digbyana* (formerly known as *Brassavola digbyana*), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general Oswaldo López Arellano, thinking that *Brassavola digbyana* \"is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction\", as the decree dictates it.\n\n\nThe national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply \"the Pine that appears symbolically in our Coat of Arms\" (*el Pino que figura simbólicamente en nuestro Escudo*),[137] even though pines comprise a genus and not a species, and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms *either*. Because of its commonality in the country, the *Pinus oocarpa* species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the *Pinus caribaea*.\n\n\nThe national mammal is the white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.[*clarification needed*] It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.\nThe national bird of Honduras is the scarlet macaw (*Ara macao*). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.\n\n\n\n### Folklore[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Honduran folklore\n\nLegends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. Lluvia de Peces (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El Cadejo and La Llorona are also popular.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Honduras\n\n![](image)Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano in San Pedro Sula is the official ground of football in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.\n![](image)Mauricio Dubón–the first born and raised Honduran in the MLB–preparing his shortstop play.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Honduras.[138] Honduras's first international competition began in 1921 at the Independence Centenary Games featuring neighboring countries in Central America.[139] The highest division of football is The Honduran National Professional Football League (Spanish: *La Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional de Honduras*), which was established in 1964.[140] The league is recognized on a continental level, as C.D. Olimpia–the only Honduran club to win the competition–won the CONCACAF Champions League in 1972 and 1988.[141][142] The Honduras national football team (Spanish: *Selección de fútbol de Honduras*) is considered one of the best nations in North America, as the country last won the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 1981 and placed third in 2013.[143][144] On a global scale, Honduras has competed in the FIFA World Cup three times in 1982, 2010, and 2014, although *Los Catrachos* have yet to win a game.[145][146][147]\n\n\nBaseball is the second most popular sport in Honduras.[148] Honduras's first international competition began in 1950 in the Baseball World Cup, which was the most prestigious global competition at the time.[149] The country lacks a division in baseball, likely due to the absence of competition in international baseball since 1973.[*citation needed*] The Honduras national baseball team (Spanish: *Selección de béisbol de Honduras*) is shy of being a top ten nation in North and South America due to infrequent scheduling, although competition is consistent and growing at the youth level.[150][151] Inspiration at the youth level came from Mauricio Dubón being the first born and raised Honduran to start in Major League Baseball, who is currently competing today.[152]\n\n\nAll other sports tend to be minor at best, as Honduras has not won a medal in the Olympics and has not made notable results in other world championships yet.[153] However, Hondurans have consistently entered track & field and swimming games at the Summer Olympics since 1968 and 1984, respectively.[154] Occasionally, Honduras has competed in combat sports ranging from judo to boxing at the Summer Olympics as well.[155][156] Gender inequality in Honduras is present in the sports industry, as teams like the Honduras women's national football team (Spanish: *Selección de fútbol de Honduras Femenina*) has yet to qualify in global and continental tournaments and softball being nearly nonexistent in the country.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Honduras portal\n\n\n* Outline of Honduras\n* Index of Honduras-related articles\n* Water crisis in Honduras\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** /hɒnˈdjʊərəs, -æs/ ⓘ;[7] Spanish: [onˈduɾas] ⓘ\n2. **^** Spanish: *República de Honduras*\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Honduras\". *The World Factbook*. 5 January 2016.

Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language.[10][11] It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world,[12] and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.\n\n\nBounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi).[13] It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent's land area.[14] Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.[13] This unique environmental heritage positions Brazil at number one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\n\nThe territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the discovered land for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. Slavery was abolished in 1888. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An authoritarian military dictatorship emerged in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.[15] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[16]\n\n\nBrazil is a regional and middle power[17][18][19] and is also classified as an emerging power and a major non-NATO ally.[20][21][22][23][24] Categorised as a developing country with a high Human Development Index,[25] Brazil is considered an advanced emerging economy,[26] having the ninth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and eighth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America.[6][27] As an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank[28] and a newly industrialized country,[29] Brazil has the largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[30] However, the country retains noticeable corruption, crime and social inequality. Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, G4, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Brazil is also an Observer State of the Arab League.[31]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Brazil\n\nThe word \"Brazil\" likely comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.[32] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called *pau-brasil*, with the word *brasil* commonly given the etymology \"red like an ember\", formed from *brasa* (\"ember\") and the suffix *-il* (from *-iculum* or *-ilium*).[33] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.[34] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.[35]\n\n\nThe official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the \"Land of the Holy Cross\" (*Terra da Santa Cruz*),[36] but European sailors and merchants commonly called it the \"Land of Brazil\" (*Terra do Brasil*) because of the brazilwood trade.[37] The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the \"Land of Parrots\".[38]\n\n\nIn the Guaraní language, an official language of Paraguay, Brazil is called \"Pindorama\", meaning \"land of the palm trees\".[39]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Brazil\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Brazilian history.\n\n### Pre-Cabraline era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Cabraline history of Brazil\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Brazil and Marajoara culture\n\n![](image)Rock art at Serra da Capivara National Park, one of the largest and oldest concentrations of prehistoric sites in the Americas[40]\nSome of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.[41][42] \nThe earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near Santarém and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture.[43] The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.[44]\n\n\nAround the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,[45] mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, Guaranis, Gês, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinambás.[46]\n\n\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.[47] These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war.[48][49] While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions.[47] Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.[50]\n\n\n\n### Portuguese colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPedro Álvares Cabral landing in Porto Seguro in 1500, ushering in more than 300 years of Portuguese rule\n![](image)\nTiradentes, who led the separatist movement Inconfidência Mineira, was sentenced to death in 1792.\n![](image)\n*Execution of the Punishment of the Whip* by Jean-Baptiste Debret. Nearly 5 million enslaved Africans were imported to Brazil during the Atlantic slave trade, more than any country.[51]\n\nMain articles: Colonial Brazil and Portuguese Empire\n\nSee also: Slavery in Brazil, War of the Emboabas, and Minas Gerais Conspiracy\n\nFollowing the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral.[52] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi–Guarani family and fought among themselves.[53] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies.[54][55]\n\n\nHowever, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.[55][56] In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.[57][58][59][60]\n\n\nBy the mid-16th century, cane sugar had become Brazil's most important export,[53][61] while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the slave market of Western Africa[62] (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and Mozambique), had become its largest import,[63][64] to cope with sugarcane plantations, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.[65][66] Brazil received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years 1500 and 1800.[67]\n\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline[68] and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a gold rush[69] which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world.[70] This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.[71]\n\n\nPortuguese expeditions known as *bandeiras* gradually expanded Brazil's original colonial frontiers in South America to its approximately current borders.[72][73] In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranhão during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch–Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union.[74]\n\n\nThe Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,[75] and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the Minas Gerais Conspiracy.[76]\n\n\n\n### Elevation to kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves\n\nSee also: Invasion of Portugal (1807) and Transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil\n\n![](image)The Acclamation of King João VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in Rio de Janeiro, 6 February 1818\nIn late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro.[77] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges[78] and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana.[79]\n\n\nWith the end of the Peninsular War in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.[80] However, the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see Liberal Revolution of 1820). In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,[81] John VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, Prince Pedro de Alcântara, as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil.[82]\n\n\n\n### Independent empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Independence of Brazil and Empire of Brazil\n\n![](image)Declaration of the Brazilian independence by Pedro I on 7 September 1822\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.[83] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.[84] A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil.[85]\n\n\nThe Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province.[86] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[87] Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825.[88]\n\n\nOn 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of republican secession[89] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro I departed for Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown after abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (Dom Pedro II).[90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil between 1831 and 1889\nAs the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a regency was set up by the National Assembly.[91] In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the Cabanagem in Grão-Pará, the Malê Revolt in Salvador, the Balaiada (Maranhão), the Sabinada (Bahia), and the Ragamuffin War, which began in Rio Grande do Sul and was supported by Giuseppe Garibaldi. These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state.[92] This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841.[93]\n\n\nDuring the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,[94] as a result of the British Aberdeen Act and the Eusébio de Queirós Law, but only in May 1888, after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the Golden Law.[95]\n\n\nThe foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with whom Brazil had borders. Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in the independence of Uruguay,[96] Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II: the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.[97][98]\n\n\nAlthough there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[99] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.[100] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto \"*Ordem e Progresso*\", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday.[101]\n\n\n\n### Early republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First Brazilian Republic, Vargas Era, and Second Brazilian Republic\n\n![](image)\n*Proclamation of the Republic*, 1893, oil on canvas by Benedito Calixto\n![](image)\nGetúlio Vargas (*center*) during the Revolution of 1930\n![](image)\nBrazilian Expeditionary Force in Massarosa, Italy, during WWII\n\nThe early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.[102] Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.[103][104][105]\n\n\nIf in relation to its foreign policy, the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,[106] only broken by the Acre War (1899–1902) and its involvement in World War I (1914–1918),[107][108][109] followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations;[110] Internally, from the crisis of *Encilhamento*[111][112][113] and the Navy Revolts,[114] a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian[115][116][117] and military.[118][119][120]\n\n\nLittle by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, successfully led the Revolution of 1930.[121][122] Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.[123][124]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed. The first was the Constitutionalist Revolution in 1932, led by the São Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a Communist uprising in November 1935, and the last one a *putsch* attempt by local fascists in May 1938.[125][126][127] The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch. The 1937 *coup d'état* resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the Estado Novo era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased.[128]\n\n\nDuring World War II, Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, entered the war on the allied side.[129][130][131] In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic, Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign.[132]\n\n\nWith the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable, and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy \"reinstated\" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.[133] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military dictatorship in Brazil and History of Brazil since 1985\n\n![](image)Construction of the National Congress building in Brasília, 1959, during the JK administration\nSeveral brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide.[136] Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.[137] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,[138] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960.[139] Kubitschek's successor, Jânio Quadros, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.[140] His vice-president, João Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition[141] and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship.[142]\n\n\n\n![](image)M41s along the Avenida Presidente Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, in April 1968, during the military dictatorship\nThe new regime was intended to be transitory[143] but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.[144] Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,[145][146] inside and outside the country through the infamous \"Operation Condor\".[147][148] Like other brutal authoritarian regimes, due to an economic boom, known as the \"economic miracle\", the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.[149]\n\n\nSlowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas.[150] The inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Ernesto Geisel and Golbery do Couto e Silva.[151] With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began a slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ulysses Guimarães holding the Constitution of 1988\nCivilians returned to power in 1985 when José Sarney assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime.[152] Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.[153] Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real,[154] that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.[155][156] Cardoso won the 1994 election, and again in 1998.[157]\n\n\nThe peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.[158][159] However, sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption, police brutality, inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service, numerous peaceful protests erupted in Brazil from the middle of first term of Dilma Rousseff, who had succeeded Lula after winning election in 2010 and again in 2014 by narrow margins.[160][161]\n\n\nRousseff was impeached by the Brazilian Congress in 2016, halfway into her second term,[162][163] and replaced by her Vice-president Michel Temer, who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff's impeachment was accepted on 31 August. Large street protests for and against her took place during the impeachment process.[164] The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians from all the primary political parties. In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President Michel Temer's cabinet who were allegedly linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal.[165] President Temer himself was also accused of corruption.[166] According to a 2018 poll, 62% of the population said that corruption was Brazil's biggest problem.[167]\n\n\nIn the fiercely disputed 2018 elections, the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes.[168] In the early 2020s, Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.[169] In May 2021, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that he would run for a third term in the 2022 Brazilian general election against Bolsonaro.[170] On october 2022, Lula was in first place in first round, with 48.43% of the support from the electorate, and received 50.90% of the votes in the second round.[171][172] On 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration, a mob of Bolsonaro's supporters attacked Brazil's federal government buildings in the capital, Brasília, after several weeks of unrest.[173][174]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSerra dos Órgãos National Park, Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro state\n![](image)\nThe majority of Amazon rainforest is contained within Brazil\n\nBrazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior,[175] sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.[13]\n\n\nThe brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[175] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6°N and 34°S, and longitudes 28° and 74°W.[13]\n\n\nBrazil is the fifth largest country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of 8,515,767.049 km2 (3,287,956 sq mi),[176] including 55,455 km2 (21,411 sq mi) of water. North to South, Brazil is also the longest country in the world, spanning 4,395 km (2,731 mi) from north to south,[13] and the only country in the world that has the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn running through it.[13] It spans four time zones; from UTC−5 comprising the state of Acre and the westernmost portion of Amazonas, to UTC−4 in the western states, to UTC−3 in the eastern states (the national time) and UTC−2 in the Atlantic islands.[177]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Brazil\n\n![](image)Brazil map of Köppen climate classification zones\nThe climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.[13] According to the Köppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: desert, equatorial, tropical, semiarid, oceanic and subtropical. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.[178] Many regions have starkly different microclimates.[179][180]\n\n\nAn equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real dry season, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.[178] Temperatures average 25 °C (77 °F),[180] with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.[179] Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.[179] This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.[178] In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.[181] South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of São Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year.[178] The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18 °C (64.4 °F);[180] winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas.[178][179]\n\n\nThe semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimeters (31.5 in) of rain,[181] most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year[182] and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought.[179] Brazil's 1877–78 *Grande Seca* (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history,[183] caused approximately half a million deaths.[184] A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.[185]\n\n\nIn 2020 the government of Brazil pledged to reduce its annual greenhouse gases emissions by 43% by 2030. It also set as indicative target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 if the country gets 10 billion dollars per year.[186]\n\n\n\n### Topography and hydrography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of rivers of Brazil\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Brazil\nBrazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660 ft) and 800 meters (2,600 ft) in elevation.[187] The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country.[187] The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.[187]\n\n\nThe southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 meters (3,900 ft).[187] These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinhaço mountains and the Serra do Mar.[187] In the north, the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2,994 meters (9,823 ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[13]\n\n\nBrazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic.[188] Major rivers include the Amazon (the world's second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water), the Paraná and its major tributary the Iguaçu (which includes the Iguazu Falls), the Negro, São Francisco, Xingu, Madeira and Tapajós rivers.[188]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environment of Brazil, Wildlife of Brazil, and Conservation in Brazil\n\nFurther information: Environmental issues in Brazil and Protected areas of Brazil\n\n![](image)The toco toucan is an animal typical of the Brazilian savannas.\nThe wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country. Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all species in the world,[189] Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued.[190] Brazil has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000), and mammals (over 689).[191] It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744).[191] The number of fungal species is unknown but is large.[192] Brazil is second only to Indonesia as the country with the most endemic species.[193]\n\n\nBrazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest, recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world,[194] with the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado, sustaining the greatest biodiversity.[195] In the south, the Araucaria moist forests grow under temperate conditions.[195] The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.[195] Larger mammals include carnivores pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums, and armadillos. Deer are plentiful in the south, and many species of New World monkeys are found in the northern rain forests.[195][196]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cumulatively, Brazil has the highest percentage of deforested and degraded rainforest of any Amazonia nation.[197]\nMore than one-fifth of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has been completely destroyed, and more than 70 mammals are endangered.[191] The threat of extinction comes from several sources, including deforestation and poaching. Extinction is even more problematic in the Atlantic Forest, where nearly 93% of the forest has been cleared.[198] Of the 202 endangered animals in Brazil, 171 are in the Atlantic Forest.[199] The Amazon rainforest has been under direct threat of deforestation since the 1970s because of rapid economic and demographic expansion. Extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year, and with it a diverse series of species through habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation.[200] Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000 sq mi) of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared by logging.[201]\n\n\nIn 2017, preserved native vegetation occupies 61% of the Brazilian territory. Agriculture occupied only 8% of the national territory and pastures 19.7%.[202] In terms of comparison, in 2019, although 43% of the entire European continent has forests, only 3% of the total forest area in Europe is of native forest.[203] Brazil has a strong interest in conservation as its agriculture sector directly depends on its forests.[204]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Brazil, Federal government of Brazil, and Elections in Brazil\n\n![](image)National Congress, seat of the legislative branch\n![](image)Palácio do Planalto, the official workplace of the President of Brazil\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system.[15] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[15] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.[205] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.[15]\n\n\nLegislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a \"flawed democracy\", ranking 46th in the report,[206] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at *Freedom in the World* report.[207]\n\n\nThe political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.[15] The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the \"spheres of government\". The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism.[15]\n\n\nThe classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[15] The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres. All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.[208][209][210]\n\n\nFor most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, with proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[15] The country has more than 40 active political parties. Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.[211]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Brazil\n\n![](image)Supreme Federal Court of Brazil serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country.\nBrazilian law is based on the civil law legal system[212] and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.[208]\n\n\nThe legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.[213] As of July 2022[update], there have been 124 amendments.[214] The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.[215] Municipalities and the Federal District have \"organic laws\" (*leis orgânicas*), which act in a similar way to constitutions.[216] Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.[15] Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.[15] There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.[15]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian Armed Forces\n\n![](image)\nBrazilian Air Force Saab Gripen NG\n![](image)\nBrazilian Navy's flagship PHM *Atlântico* and frigate *Liberal* (F-43) (background)\n\nThe armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.[217] The country was considered the 9th largest military power on the planet in 2021.[218][219] It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation), and the Brazilian Air Force. Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million reservists annually.[220]\n\n\nNumbering close to 236,000 active personnel,[221] the Brazilian Army has the largest number of armored vehicles in South America, including armored transports and tanks.[222] The states' Military Police and the Military Firefighters Corps are described as an ancillary forces of the Army by the constitution, but are under the control of each state's governor.[15]\n\n\nBrazil's navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two *Minas Geraes*-class dreadnoughts, sparking a naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.[223] Today, it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities, GRUMEC, unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast.[224] As of 2022[update], it is the only navy in Latin America that operates an helicopter carrier, NAM *Atlântico*, and one of twelve navies in the world to operate or have one under construction.[225]\n\n\nThe Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Brazil\n\n![](image)Itamaraty Palace, the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nBrazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.[227] According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.[228]\n\n\nBrazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's position as a regional power in Latin America, a leader among developing countries, and an emerging world power.[229] Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.[230] Brazil is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations.\n\n\nAn increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.[231] Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.[231] Total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year, which includes.[231] In addition, Brazil already managed a peacekeeping mission in Haiti ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the World Food Programme ($300 million).[231] This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies. The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India.[231] The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a \"global model in waiting\".[232]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Brazil and Crime in Brazil\n\n![](image)Field agents of the Federal Police's Tactical Operations Command\nIn Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No. 104, of 2019), Military Police and Civil Police. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities, the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state/district government. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers.[15] The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.[233]\n\n\nThe country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest rates of homicide of the world.[234] The number considered tolerable by the WHO is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[235] In 2018, Brazil had a record 63,880 murders.[236] However, there are differences between the crime rates in the Brazilian states. While in São Paulo the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in Alagoas it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[237]\n\n\nBrazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only China and the United States), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992.[238] The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about 200,000 accommodations.[239]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Brazil and LGBT rights in Brazil\n\nLGBT rights are generally supported within Brazil,[240][241] and same-sex marriage has been fully recognised since 2013.[242] However, police violence and gender-based discrimination remain prevalent throughout the nation.[243][244] Brazil has one of the highest Gini coefficient rankings in Latin America.[7]\n\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Brazil\n\nFurther information: Municipalities of Brazil, States of Brazil, and Regions of Brazil\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n*AtlanticOcean*\n\n*PacificOcean*\n\nNorth\n\nNortheast\n\nCentral-West\n\nSoutheast\n\nSouth\n\nAcre\n\nAmazonas\n\nPará\n\nRoraima\n\nAmapá\n\nRondônia\n\nTocantins\n\nMaranhão\n\nBahia\n\nPiauí\n\nCeará\n\nRio Grandedo Norte\n\nParaíba\n\nPernambuco\n\nAlagoas\n\nSergipe\n\nMato Grosso\n\nMato Grossodo Sul\n\nFederalDistrict\n\nGoiás\n\nMinas Gerais\n\nSão Paulo\n\nRio de Janeiro\n\nEspírito Santo\n\nParaná\n\nSanta Catarina\n\nRio Grandedo Sul\n\n*Argentina*\n\n*Bolivia*\n\n*Chile*\n\n*Colombia*\n\n*French Guiana*\n\n*Guyana*\n\n*Paraguay*\n\n*Peru*\n\n*Suriname*\n\n*Uruguay*\n\n*Venezuela*\nStates of Brazil and Regions of Brazil |\n\n\nBrazil is a federation composed of 26 states, one federal district, and the 5,570 municipalities.[15] States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.[15]\n\n\nThe states and the federal district are grouped into regions: Northern, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast and Southern. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions serve mainly statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.\n\n\nMunicipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal and state government.[15] Each has an elected mayor and legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called *comarca* (county).\n\n\nBrazil's constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories, which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government. However, there are currently no federal territories in the country, as the 1988 Constitution abolished the last three: Amapá and Roraima (which gained statehood status) and Fernando de Noronha, which became a state district of Pernambuco.[245][246]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Brazil\n\nSee also: Brazilian real, Agriculture in Brazil, Mining in Brazil, and Industry in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo, the largest financial centre in Brazil\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nSoybean crop in Rondonópolis, Mato Grosso[247]\n![](image)\nThe KC-390, developed by Embraer, the third largest producer of civil aircraft, after Boeing and Airbus[248]\n\nBrazil's upper-middle income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources.[249] It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the tenth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the ninth-largest by PPP. After rapid growth in preceding decades, the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests. A developing country, Brazil has a labor force of roughly 100 million,[250] which is the world's fifth-largest; with a high unemployment rate of 14.4% as of 2021[update].[251] Its foreign exchange reserves are the tenth-highest in the world.[252] The B3 in São Paulo is the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization. In regards to poverty, about 1.9% of the total population lives at $2.15 a day,[253] while about 19% live at $6.85 a day.[254] Brazil's economy suffers from endemic corruption and high income inequality.[255] The Brazilian real is the national currency.\n\n\nBrazil's diversified economy includes agriculture, industry, and a wide range of services.[256] The large service sector accounts for about 72.7% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (20.7%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up 6.6% of total GDP.[257]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the largest producers of various agricultural commodities,[258] and also has a large cooperative sector that provides 50% of the food in the country.[259] It has been the world's largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[30] Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee and orange; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, cotton, lemon, tobacco, pineapple, banana, beans, coconut, watermelon and papaya; and is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, mango, rice, tomato, sorghum, tangerine, avocado, persimmon, and guava, among others. Regarding livestock, it is one of the 5 largest producers of chicken meat, beef, pork and cow's milk in the world.[260] In the mining sector, Brazil is among the largest producers of iron ore, copper, gold,[261] bauxite, manganese, tin, niobium,[262] and nickel. In terms of precious stones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[263][264] The country is a major exporter of soy, iron ore, pulp (cellulose), maize, beef, chicken meat, soybean meal, sugar, coffee, tobacco, cotton, orange juice, footwear, airplanes, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol, semi-finished iron, among other products.[265][266]\n\n\nBrazil is the world's 24th-largest exporter and 26th-largest importer as of 2021[update].[267][268] China is its largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of the total trade. Other large trading partners include the United States, Argentina, the Netherlands and Canada.[269] Its automotive industry is the eighth-largest in the world.[270] In the food industry, Brazil was the second-largest exporter of processed foods in the world in 2019.[271] The country was the second-largest producer of pulp in the world and the eighth-largest producer of paper in 2016.[272] In the footwear industry, Brazil was the fourth-largest producer in 2019.[273] It was also the ninth-largest producer of steel in the world.[274][275][276] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the eighth-largest in the world.[277][278][279] Although, it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, Brazil's textile industry is very little integrated into world trade.[280]\n\n\nThe tertiary sector (trade and services) represented 75.8% of the country's GDP in 2018, according to the IBGE. The service sector was responsible for 60% of GDP and trade for 13%. It covers a wide range of activities: commerce, accommodation and catering, transport, communications, financial services, real estate activities and services provided to businesses, public administration (urban cleaning, sanitation, etc.) and other services such as education, social and health services, research and development, sports activities, etc., since it consists of activities complementary to other sectors.[281][282] Micro and small businesses represent 30% of the country's GDP. In the commercial sector, for example, they represent 53% of the GDP within the activities of the sector.[283]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nIguazu Falls on the Argentina–Brazil border\n![](image)\nThe colonial city of Ouro Preto, a World Heritage Site\n\nTourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country. The country had 6.36 million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico.[284] Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the 2008–2009 economic crisis.[285] Historical records of 5.4 million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011.[286][287] In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars).[288]\n\n\nNatural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of ecotourism with leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as cultural tourism. Among the most popular destinations are the Amazon Rainforest, beaches and dunes in the Northeast Region, the Pantanal in the Center-West Region, beaches at Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina, cultural tourism in Minas Gerais and business trips to São Paulo.[289]\n\n\nIn terms of the 2015 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28th place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States.[290][291]\n\n\nDomestic tourism is a key market segment for the tourism industry in Brazil. In 2005, 51 million Brazilian nationals made ten times more trips than foreign tourists and spent five times more money than their international counterparts.[292] The main destination states in 2005 were São Paulo (27.7%), Minas Gerais (10.8%), Rio de Janeiro (8.4%), Bahia (7.4%), and Santa Catarina (7.2%). The top three states by trip origin were São Paulo (35.7%), Minas Gerais (13.6%).[292] In terms of tourism revenues, the top earners by state were São Paulo (16.4%) and Bahia (11.7%). For 2005, the three main trip purposes were visiting friends and family (53.1%), sun and beach (40.8%), and cultural tourism (12.5%).[293]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nVLS-1 at the Alcântara Launch Center of the Brazilian Space Agency, in Alcântara, Maranhão\n![](image)\nSirius, a diffraction-limited storage ring synchrotron light source at the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron, in Campinas, São Paulo\n\nTechnological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies.[294] Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, the Butantan Institute, the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Center, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the National Institute for Space Research.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Brazilian Space Agency has the most advanced space program in Latin America, with significant resources to launch vehicles, and manufacture of satellites.[297] Owner of relative technological sophistication, the country develops submarines, aircraft, as well as being involved in space research, having a Vehicle Launch Center Light and being the only country in the Southern Hemisphere the integrate team building International Space Station (ISS).[298]\n\n\nThe country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water, from where it extracts 73% of its reserves.\nUranium is enriched at the Resende Nuclear Fuel Factory, mostly for research purposes (as Brazil obtains 88% of its electricity from hydroelectricity[299]) and the country's first nuclear submarine is expected to be launched in 2029.[300]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the three countries in Latin America[301] with an operational Synchrotron Laboratory, a research facility on physics, chemistry, material science and life sciences, and Brazil is the only Latin American country to have a semiconductor company with its own fabrication plant, the CEITEC.[302] According to the Global Information Technology Report 2009–2010 of the World Economic Forum, Brazil is the world's 61st largest developer of information technology.[303] Brazil was ranked 49th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 66th in 2019.[304][305][306]\n\n\nAmong the most renowned Brazilian inventors are priests Bartolomeu de Gusmão, Landell de Moura and Francisco João de Azevedo, besides Alberto Santos-Dumont,[307] Evaristo Conrado Engelberg,[308] Manuel Dias de Abreu,[309] Andreas Pavel[310] and Nélio José Nicolai.[311] Brazilian science is represented by the likes of César Lattes (Brazilian physicist Pathfinder of *Pi Meson*),[312] Mário Schenberg (considered the greatest theoretical physicist of Brazil),[313] José Leite Lopes (only Brazilian physicist holder of the *UNESCO Science Prize*),[314] Artur Ávila (the first Latin American winner of the Fields Medal)[315] and Fritz Müller (pioneer in factual support of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin).[316]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nThe Itaipu Dam on the Paraná River, the second largest of the world. Brazilian energy matrix is one of the cleanest in the world.\n![](image)\nWind farm in Parnaíba, Piauí. Brazil is one of the 5 largest producers of wind energy in the world.\n\nBrazil is the world's ninth largest energy consumer.[317] Much of its energy comes from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol; the Itaipu Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation,[318] and the country has other large plants like Belo Monte and Tucuruí. The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005.[319]\n\n\nAt the end of 2021 Brazil was the 2nd country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (109.4 GW) and biomass (15.8 GW), the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21.1 GW) and the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13.0 GW) – on track to also become one of the top 10 in the world in solar energy.[320] At the end of 2021, Brazil was the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, the United States and Germany, and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[321]\n\n\nThe main characteristic of the Brazilian energy matrix is that it is much more renewable than that of the world. While in 2019 the world matrix was only 14% made up of renewable energy, Brazil's was at 45%. Petroleum and oil products made up 34.3% of the matrix; sugar cane derivatives, 18%; hydraulic energy, 12.4%; natural gas, 12.2%; firewood and charcoal, 8.8%; varied renewable energies, 7%; mineral coal, 5.3%; nuclear, 1.4%, and other non-renewable energies, 0.6%.[322]\n\n\nIn the electric energy matrix, the difference between Brazil and the world is even greater: while the world only had 25% of renewable electric energy in 2019, Brazil had 83%. The Brazilian electric matrix was composed of: hydraulic energy, 64.9%; biomass, 8.4%; wind energy, 8.6%; solar energy, 1%; natural gas, 9.3%; oil products, 2%; nuclear, 2.5%; coal and derivatives, 3.3%.[322]\nBrazil has the largest electricity sector in Latin America.\nIts capacity at the end of 2021 was 181,532 MW.[323]\n\n\nAs for oil, the Brazilian government has embarked on a program over the decades to reduce dependence on imported oil, which previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs. Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. In 2021, the country closed the year as the 7th oil producer in the world, with an average of close to three million barrels per day, becoming an exporter of the product.[324][325]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nTerminal 3 of the São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, the busiest airport in South America\n![](image)\nBR-116 in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, the longest highway in the country,[326] with 4,542 km (2,822 mi) of extension[327]\n\nBrazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled 1,720,000 km (1,068,758 mi) in 2019.[328] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018.[329][330]\n\n\nBrazil's railway system has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to highway construction. The country's total railway track length was 30,576 km (18,999 mi) in 2015,[331] as compared with 31,848 km (19,789 mi) in 1970, making it the ninth largest network in the world. Most of the railway system belonged to the Federal Railroad Network Corporation (RFFSA), which was privatized in 2007.[332] The São Paulo Metro was the first underground transit system in Brazil, which began operating on 14 September 1974.[333]\n\n\nThere are about 2,500 airports in Brazil, including landing fields: the second largest number in the world, after the United States.[334] São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, near São Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 20 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.[335]\n\n\nFor freight transport waterways are of importance, e.g. the industrial zones of Manaus can be reached only by means of the Solimões–Amazonas waterway (3,250 kilometers or 2,020 miles in length, with a minimum depth of six meters or 20 feet). The country also has 50,000 kilometers (31,000 miles) of waterways.[336] Coastal shipping links widely separated parts of the country. Bolivia and Paraguay have been given free ports at Santos. Of the 36 deep-water ports, Santos, Itajaí, Rio Grande, Paranaguá, Rio de Janeiro, Sepetiba, Vitória, Suape, Manaus, and São Francisco do Sul are the most important.[337] Bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced, container ships 36.3 hours on average.[338]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Brazil and Brazilians\n\nSee also: Immigration to Brazil and List of Brazilian states by population density\n\n![](image)Population density of Brazilian municipalities\nThe population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million[339] (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer or 57.8/sq mi), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1[340] and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.[341] The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.\n\n\nThe first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478.[342] From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.[343] Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline. In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years[344] and to 72.6 years in 2007.[345]\nIt has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050[346] thus completing the demographic transition.[347]\n\n\nIn 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48%.[348]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\nRace and ethnicity in Brazil 2022\n\n\n\nMixed (45.3%)\nWhite (42.8%)\nBlack (10.6%)\nEast Asian (1.1%)\nNatives (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2022, 45.3% of the population (about 91 million) described themselves as Pardo, 43.8% (about 88 million) as White, 10.6% (about 21 million) as Black, 1.1% (about 2 million) as East Asian (officially called *yellow* or *amarela*) and 0.8% (about 1 million) as Amerindian (officially called *indígena*, Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.[349]\n\n\nSince the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, considerable genetic mixing between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans has taken place in all regions of the country (with European ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population, accounting for between 65% and 77%).[350][351][352][353] From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to immigration. About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Armenian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Arab origin.[354][355][356] Brazil has the second largest Jewish community in Latin America making up 0.06% of its population.[357] Brazil also has the largest Arab (or Arab ancestry) community in the world outside the Arab world, with 15–20 million people.[358][359] According to Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil is a home to a Lebanese diaspora of 7 million to 10 million, surpassing the population of Lebanese individuals residing in Lebanon.[360] Brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines, although a high income disparity is found between race groups, so racism and classism often overlap. The brown population (officially called *pardo* in Portuguese, also colloquially *moreno*)[361][362] is a broad category that includes *caboclos* (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), *mulatos* (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and *cafuzos* (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives).[361][362][363][364][365] Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba[365][366] and also in northern Maranhão,[367][368] southern Minas Gerais[369] and in eastern Rio de Janeiro.[365][369]\n\n\nPeople of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Center-Western regions.[370] In 2007, the National Indian Foundation estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005. Brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.[371]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nFurther information: Catholic Church in Brazil and Protestantism in Brazil\n\nReligion in Brazil (2010 Census)\n\n\n\nCatholicism (64.6%)\nProtestantism (22.2%)\nSpiritism (2.0%)\nOther (3.2%)\nNo religion (8.0%)\n\nChristianity is the country's predominant faith, with Roman Catholicism being its largest denomination. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population.[372][373] According to the 2010 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 64.63% of the population followed Roman Catholicism; 22.2% Protestantism; 2.0% Kardecist spiritism; 3.2% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 8.0% had no religion.[3]\n\n\nReligion in Brazil was formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples.[374] This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholic Church, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities,[375]\n\n\nReligious pluralism increased during the 20th century,[376] and the Protestant community has grown to include over 22% of the population.[377] The most common Protestant denominations are Evangelical Pentecostal ones. Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans and the Reformed tradition.[378]\n\n\nIn recent decades, Protestantism, particularly in forms of Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly.[379] After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 8% of the population as of the 2010 census. The cities of Boa Vista, Salvador, and Porto Velho have the greatest proportion of Irreligious residents in Brazil. Teresina, Fortaleza, and Florianópolis were the most Roman Catholic in the country.[380] Greater Rio de Janeiro, not including the city proper, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while Greater Porto Alegre and Greater Fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.[380]\n\n\nIn October 2009, the Brazilian Senate approved and enacted by the President of Brazil in February 2010, an agreement with the Vatican, in which the Legal Statute of the Catholic Church in Brazil is recognized.[381][382]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Brazil and Sistema Único de Saúde\n\n![](image)The Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre is academically linked to the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and is part of the SUS, the Brazilian publicly funded health care system.\nThe Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (*Sistema Único de Saúde* – SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government,[383] being the largest system of this type in the world.[384] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role.[385]\n\n\nPublic health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.[386][387]\n\n\nDespite all the progress made since the creation of the universal health care system in 1988, there are still several public health problems in Brazil. In 2006, the main points to be solved were the high infant (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (73.1 deaths per 1000 births).[388]\n\n\nThe number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and cancer (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.[388] The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000.[389]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Brazil\n\n![](image)Historical building of the Federal University of Paraná, one of the oldest universities in Brazil, located in Curitiba\nThe Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources. The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.[390]\n\n\nAccording to the IBGE, in 2019, the literacy rate of the population was 93.4%, meaning that 11.3 million (6.6% of population) people are still illiterate in the country, with some states like Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina reaching around 97% of literacy rate;[391] functional illiteracy has reached 21.6% of the population.[392] Illiteracy is higher in the Northeast, where 13.87% of the population is illiterate, while the South, has 3.3% of its population illiterate.[393][391]\n\n\nBrazil's private institutions tend to be more exclusive and offer better quality education, so many high-income families send their children there. The result is a segregated educational system that reflects extreme income disparities and reinforces social inequality. However, efforts to change this are making impacts.[394]\n\n\nThe University of São Paulo is the second best university in Latin America, according to recent 2019 QS World University Rankings. Of the top 20 Latin American universities, eight are Brazilian. Most of them are public.\nAttending an institution of higher education is required by Law of Guidelines and Bases of Education. Kindergarten, elementary and medium education are required of all students.[395]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil, Portuguese language, Brazilian Portuguese, and List of endangered languages in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nMuseum of the Portuguese Language in São Paulo\n![](image)\nAlto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory, in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas, \nwhere Nhengatu, Tucano and Baniwa are co-official languages\n![](image)\nPomerode, Santa Catarina, where the East Pomeranian is the second language (see Brazilian German)\n\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.[396]\n\n\nBrazilian Portuguese has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese[397] (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and more recent immigrants, coming from Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese Macaronesia), with a few influences from the Amerindian and African languages, especially West African and Bantu restricted to the vocabulary only.[398] As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, partly because of the more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between American and British English.[398]\n\n\nThe 2002 sign language law[399] requires government authorities and public agencies to accept and provide information in *Língua Brasileira dos Sinais* or \"LIBRAS\", the Brazilian Sign Language, while a 2005 presidential edict[400] extends this to require teaching of the language as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access (\"inclusion\") to deaf people.[401]\n\n\nMinority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants.[398] In the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Nheengatu (a currently endangered South American creole language – or an 'anti-creole', according to some linguists – with mostly Indigenous Brazilian languages lexicon and Portuguese-based grammar that, together with its southern relative língua geral paulista, once was a major lingua franca in Brazil,[402] being replaced by Portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by major political changes),[*excessive detail?*] Baniwa and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.[403]\n\n\nThere are significant communities of German (mostly the Brazilian Hunsrückisch, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the Talian, a Venetian dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language.[404][405] Talian is officially a historic patrimony of Rio Grande do Sul,[406] and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.[407] Italian is also recognized as *ethnic language* in the Santa Teresa microregion and Vila Velha (Espirito Santo state), and is taught as mandatory second language at school.[408]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Brazil by population\n\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[409]\nThe largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte – all in the Southeastern Region – with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively.[410][411][412] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.[413]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[410][414][415]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | State | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State | Pop. |  |\n| ![São Paulo](image)São Paulo![Rio de Janeiro](image)Rio de Janeiro | 1 | São Paulo | São Paulo | 21,314,716 | 11 | Belém | Pará | 2,157,180\n | ![Belo Horizonte](image)Belo Horizonte![Recife](image)Recife |\n| 2 | Rio de Janeiro | Rio de Janeiro | 12,389,775 | 12 | Manaus | Amazonas | 2,130,264\n |\n| 3 | Belo Horizonte | Minas Gerais | 5,142,260 | 13 | Campinas | São Paulo | 2,105,600\n |\n| 4 | Recife | Pernambuco | 4,021,641 | 14 | Vitória | Espírito Santo | 1,837,047\n |\n| 5 | Brasília | Federal District | 3,986,425 | 15 | Baixada Santista | São Paulo | 1,702,343\n |\n| 6 | Porto Alegre | Rio Grande do Sul | 3,894,232 | 16 | São José dos Campos | São Paulo | 1,572,943\n |\n| 7 | Salvador | Bahia | 3,863,154 | 17 | São Luís | Maranhão | 1,421,569\n |\n| 8 | Fortaleza | Ceará | 3,594,924 | 18 | Natal | Rio Grande do Norte | 1,349,743\n |\n| 9 | Curitiba | Paraná | 3,387,985 | 19 | Maceió | Alagoas | 1,231,965\n |\n| 10 | Goiânia | Goiás | 2,347,557 | 20 | João Pessoa | Paraíba | 1,168,941\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Parade of Portela samba school at the Rio Carnival, the largest carnival in the world[416]\nThe core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[417] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles. The culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.[418]\n\n\nSome aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well as Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries.[419] The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.[420]\n\n\nBrazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century)[421][422] to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism. Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.[423]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer for the federal capital, an example of Modern architecture\nThe architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when Pedro Álvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500. Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.[424] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.[425] In the 19th century during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with Modernist architecture.\n\n\nThe colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonize Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside.[426]\n\n\nDuring 19th century, Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture.[426]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the modernist architecture was introduced when Brasilia was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect Oscar Niemeyer idealized and built government buildings, churches and civic buildings in the modernist style.[427]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Brazil\n\n![](image)Tom Jobim, one of the creators of *bossa nova*, and Chico Buarque, one of the leading names of MPB\nThe music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements.[428] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism.[429] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century.[428]\n\n\nPopular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with samba considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.[430] Maracatu and Afoxê are two music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual Brazilian Carnivals.[431] Capoeira is usually played with its own music referred to as capoeira music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.[432] Forró is a type of folk music prominent during the Festa Junina in northeastern Brazil.[433] Jack A. Draper III, a professor of Portuguese at the University of Missouri,[434] argues that Forró was used as a way to subdue feelings of nostalgia for a rural lifestyle.[435]\n\n\nChoro is a very popular music instrumental style. Its origins are in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. In spite of the name, the style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, subtle modulations and full of syncopation and counterpoint.[436] Bossa nova is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.[437] The phrase \"bossa nova\" means literally \"new trend\".[438] A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s.[439]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian literature\n\n![](image)Machado de Assis, poet and novelist, founder of the Brazilian Academy of Letters\nBrazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as Pêro Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.[440]\n\n\nBrazil produced significant works in Romanticism – novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and José de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels *O Guaraní*, *Iracema* and *Ubirajara*.[441] Machado de Assis, one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide.[442][443][444]\n\n\nBrazilian Modernism, evidenced by the Modern Art Week in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature,[445] while Post-Modernism brought a generation of distinct poets like João Cabral de Melo Neto, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Cora Coralina, Graciliano Ramos, Cecília Meireles, and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like Jorge Amado, João Guimarães Rosa, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira.[446][447][448]\n\n\nBrazil's most significant literary award is the Camões Prize, which it shares with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world. As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize.[449] Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a non-profit cultural organization pointed in perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.[450]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian cuisine\n\nSee also: List of Brazilian dishes\n\n![](image)Feijoada is one of the main dishes of Brazilian cuisine.\nBrazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.[451] Examples are Feijoada, considered the country's national dish;[452] and regional foods such as beiju, feijão tropeiro, vatapá, moqueca, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acarajé (from African cuisine).[453]\n\n\nThe national beverage is coffee and cachaça is Brazil's native liquor. Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha.[454]\n\n\nA typical meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef, salad, french fries and a fried egg.[455] Often, it is mixed with cassava flour (farofa). Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.[456] Popular snacks are pastel (a fried pastry); coxinha (a variation of chicken croquete); pão de queijo (cheese bread and cassava flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (a variation of Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); empanada (pastry) and empada, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.\n\n\nBrazil has a variety of desserts such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), bolo de rolo (roll cake with goiabada), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and Romeu e Julieta (cheese with goiabada). Peanuts are used to make paçoca, rapadura and pé-de-moleque. Local common fruits like açaí, cupuaçu, mango, papaya, cocoa, cashew, guava, orange, lime, passionfruit, pineapple, and hog plum are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream.[457]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Brazil\n\n![](image)Festival de Gramado, the biggest film festival in the country\nThe Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle Époque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as *Rio the Magnificent* were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city.[458] The films *Limite* (1931) and *Ganga Bruta* (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.[459] The 1941 unfinished film *It's All True* was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Cinema Novo movement rose to prominence with directors such as Glauber Rocha, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Paulo Cesar Saraceni and Arnaldo Jabor. Rocha's films *Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol* (1964) and *Terra em Transe* (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.[460]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as *O Quatrilho* (Fábio Barreto, 1995), *O Que É Isso, Companheiro?* (Bruno Barreto, 1997) and *Central do Brasil* (Walter Salles, 1998), all of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the latter receiving a Best Actress nomination for Fernanda Montenegro. The 2002 crime film *City of God*, directed by Fernando Meirelles, was critically acclaimed, scoring 90% on Rotten Tomatoes,[461] being placed in Roger Ebert's Best Films of the Decade list[462] and receiving four Academy Award nominations in 2004, including Best Director. Notable film festivals in Brazil include the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro International Film Festivals and the Gramado Festival.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Telecommunications in Brazil and Television in Brazil\n\nSee also: Concentration of media ownership § Brazil, and Mass media regulation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former President Dilma Rousseff at *Jornal Nacional* news program. Rede Globo is the world's second-largest commercial television network.[463]\nThe Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent Dom João.[464] The *Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro*, the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808.[465] The largest newspapers nowadays are *Folha de S.Paulo*, *Super Notícia*, *O Globo* and *O Estado de S. Paulo*.[466]\n\n\nRadio broadcasting began on 7 September 1922, with a speech by then President Pessoa, and was formalized on 20 April 1923 with the creation of \"Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro\".[467]\n\n\nTelevision in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, with the founding of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand.[468] Since then television has grown in the country, creating large commercial broadcast networks such as Globo, SBT, RecordTV, Bandeirantes and RedeTV. Today it is the most important factor in popular culture of Brazilian society, indicated by research showing that as much as 67%[469][470] of the general population follow the same daily soap opera broadcast.\n\n\nBy the mid-1960s Brazilian universities had installed mainframe computers from IBM, and Burroughs Large Systems. In the 1970s and 1980s the Brazilian government restricted foreign imports to protect the local manufacturing of computers. In the 1980s Brazil produced half of the computers sold in the country. By 2009 the mobile phone and Internet use of Brazil was the fifth largest in the world.[471]\n\n\nIn May 2010, the Brazilian government launched TV Brasil Internacional, an international television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.[472] Commercial television channels broadcast internationally include Globo Internacional, RecordTV Internacional and Band Internacional.\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian painting\n\n![](image)*Entry in the Forest* mural at the Thomas Jefferson Building by Candido Portinari, one of the most important Brazilian painters\nBrazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century,[473] influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism and Abstracionism making it a major art style called Brazilian academic art.[474][475]\n\n\nThe French Artistic Mission arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Académie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as modeling, decorating, carpentry and others and bringing artists like Jean-Baptiste Debret.[475]\n\n\nUpon the creation of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, new artistic movements spread across the country during the 19th century and later the event called Modern Art Week definitely broke with academic tradition in 1922 and started a nationalist trend which was influenced by modernist arts.[476]\n\n\nAmong the best-known Brazilian painters are Ricardo do Pilar and Manuel da Costa Ataíde (baroque and rococo), Victor Meirelles, Pedro Américo and Almeida Júnior (romanticism and realism), Anita Malfatti, Ismael Nery, Lasar Segall, Emiliano di Cavalcanti, Vicente do Rego Monteiro, and Tarsila do Amaral (expressionism, surrealism and cubism), Aldo Bonadei, José Pancetti and Cândido Portinari (modernism).[477]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Brazil\n\nSee also: Brazil at the Olympics\n\n![](image)Players at the podium with the first Olympic Gold of the Brazil national football team, won in the 2016 Summer Olympics. Football is the most popular sport in the country.\nThe most popular sport in Brazil is football.[478] The Brazilian men's national team is ranked among the best in the world according to the FIFA World Rankings, and has won the World Cup tournament a record five times.[479][480]\n\n\nVolleyball, basketball, auto racing, and martial arts also attract large audiences. The Brazil men's national volleyball team, for example, currently holds the titles of the World League, World Grand Champions Cup, World Championship and the World Cup. In auto racing, three Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One world championship eight times.[481][482][483] The country has also produced significant achievements in other sports such as sailing, swimming, tennis, surfing, skateboarding, MMA, gymnastics, boxing, judo, athletics and table tennis.\n\n\nSome sport variations have their origins in Brazil: beach football,[484] futsal (indoor football)[485] and footvolley emerged in Brazil as variations of football. In martial arts, Brazilians developed Capoeira,[486] Vale tudo,[487] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[488]\n\n\nBrazil has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, like the 1950 FIFA World Cup[489] and recently has hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2019 Copa América and 2021 Copa América .[490] The São Paulo circuit, Autódromo José Carlos Pace, hosts the annual Grand Prix of Brazil.[491] São Paulo organized the IV Pan American Games in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007.[492] On 2 October 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the 2016 Olympic Games and 2016 Paralympic Games, making it the first South American city to host the games[493] and second in Latin America, after Mexico City. Furthermore, the country hosted the FIBA Basketball World Cups in 1954 and 1963. At the 1963 event, the Brazil national basketball team won one of its two world championship titles.[494]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Outline of Brazil\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** includes *Caboclo*, *Mulatto*, and *Zambo*\n2. **^** includes Arab Brazilian, Jewish Brazilian, and Romani Brazilian\n3. **^** The Brazilian census uses the term *amarela* (or *yellow* in English) as a racial category to describe people of East Asian background.

It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.\n\n\nIndonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. It has 38 provinces, of which nine have special status. The country's capital, Jakarta, is the world's second-most populous urban area. Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity.\n\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the seventh century when the Srivijaya and later Majapahit Kingdoms traded with entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Muslim traders later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid economic change.\n\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\nThe name *Indonesia* derives from the Greek words *Indos* (Ἰνδός) and *nesos* (νῆσος), meaning \"Indian islands\".[12] The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[13] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms *Indunesians*—and, his preference, *Malayunesians*—for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\".[14] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used *Indonesia* as a synonym for *Indian Archipelago*.[15][16] Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use *Indonesia*. They preferred *Malay Archipelago* (Dutch: *Maleische Archipel*); the *Netherlands East Indies* (*Nederlandsch Oost Indië*), popularly *Indië*; *the East* (*de Oost*); and *Insulinde*.[17]\n\n\nAfter 1900, *Indonesia* became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.[17] Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularized the name through his book *Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894*. The first native scholar to use the name was Ki Hajar Dewantara when in 1913, he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, *Indonesisch Pers-bureau*.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Indonesia\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Borobudur ship carved on Borobudur temple, c. 800 CE. Outrigger boats from the archipelago may have made trade voyages to the east coast of Africa and Madagascar as early as the 1st century CE.[18]\nFossilised remains of *Homo erectus*, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago.[19][20][21] *Homo sapiens* reached the region around 43,000 BCE.[22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east.[23]\n\n\nIdeal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE[24] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade, including with Indian kingdoms and Chinese dynasties, from several centuries BCE.[25] Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.[26][27]\n\n\nFrom the seventh century CE, the Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished due to trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism.[28][29] Between the eighth and tenth centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of present-day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a \"Golden Age\" in Indonesian history.[30]\n\n\nThe earliest evidence of Islamized populations in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[31] Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[32]\n\n\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)The submission of Prince Diponegoro to General De Kock at the end of the Java War in 1830\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands.[33] Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony.[34]\n\n\nFor most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, and the bloody thirty-year Aceh War weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.[35][36][37] Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.[37][38][39][40]\n\n\nThe Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule[41][42][43] and encouraged the independence movement.[44] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. Then, Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir, influential nationalist leaders, were appointed president, vice-president and prime minister respectively.[45][46][47][45]\n\n\nThe Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, beginning the Indonesian National Revolution which ended in December 1949 when the Dutch recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure.[48][47] Despite extraordinary political, social, and sectarian divisions, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSukarno (*left*) and Hatta (*right*), Indonesia's founding fathers and the first President and Vice President respectively\n\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[51] Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps.[52][53][54][55] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.[56][57][58] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968. His \"New Order\" administration,[59] supported by the United States,[60][61][62] encouraged foreign direct investment,[63][64][65] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.\n\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[66] It brought out popular discontent with the New Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[41][67][68][69] In 1999, East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia[70] and a 25-year occupation marked by international condemnation of human rights abuses.[71]\n\n\nSince 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first direct presidential election in 2004.[72] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Indonesia and List of islands of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java. Indonesia's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world's highest.\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E. A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south.[75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\nAt 4,884 metres (16,024 ft), Puncak Jaya is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra is the largest lake, with an area of 1,145 km2 (442 sq mi). Indonesia's largest rivers are in Kalimantan and New Guinea and include Kapuas, Barito, Mamberamo, Sepik and Mahakam. They serve as communication and transport links between the island's river settlements.[79]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of Indonesia and Climate change in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Rainforest in Mount Palung National Park, West Kalimantan\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round.[80] Indonesia has two seasons—a wet season and a dry season—with no extremes of summer or winter.[81] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, with the wet season between November and April.[81] Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia. More cooling climate types do exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen *Cfb*) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (Köppen *Cwb*) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map of Indonesia[82]\nSome regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tends to be dry. The almost uniformly warm waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that land temperatures remain relatively constant. Humidity is quite high, at between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.[83]\n\n\nSeveral studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the projected effects of climate change.[84] These include unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around 1 °C (2 °F) by mid-century,[85][86] raising the frequency of drought and food shortages (with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons, and thus Indonesia's agriculture system[86]) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires.[86] Rising sea levels would also threaten most of Indonesia's population, who live in low-lying coastal areas.[86][87][88] Impoverished communities would likely be affected the most by climate change.[89]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Indonesia\n See also: Volcanoes of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Major volcanoes in Indonesia. Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire area.\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.[90] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi.[91] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active.[90] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on Java.[92] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas.[93] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali.[94]\n\n\nA massive supervolcano erupted at present-day Lake Toba around 70,000 BCE. It is believed to have caused a global volcanic winter and cooling of the climate and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution, though this is still in debate.[95] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa were among the largest in recorded history. The former caused 92,000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash that spread and blanketed parts of the archipelago and made much of the Northern Hemisphere without summer in 1816.[96] The latter produced the loudest sound in recorded history and caused 36,000 deaths due to the eruption itself and the resulting tsunamis, with significant additional effects around the world years after the event.[97] Recent catastrophic disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of Indonesia, Flora of Indonesia, and Protected areas of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSpecies endemic to Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: *Rafflesia arnoldii*; orangutan; greater bird-of-paradise; and Komodo dragon.\n\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.[98][99] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\nIndonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.[103] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline. The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[12] Indonesia is one of the Coral Triangle countries with the world's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[104]\n\n\nBritish naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line (Wallace Line) between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.[105] It runs roughly north–south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali. Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally Asian, while east from Lombok is increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the Weber Line. In his 1869 book, *The Malay Archipelago*, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[106] The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)Deforestation in Riau province, Sumatra, to make way for an oil palm plantation (2007)\nIndonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues. They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]\n\n\nIndonesia has one of the world's fastest deforestation rates.[109][110] In 2020, forests covered approximately 49.1% of the country's land area,[111] down from 87% in 1950.[112] Since the 1970s, log production, various plantations and agriculture have been responsible for much of the deforestation in Indonesia.[112] Most recently, it has been driven by the palm oil industry,[113] which has been criticised for its environmental impact and displacement of local communities.[110][114] The situation has made Indonesia the world's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases.[115] It also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A presidential inauguration by the MPR in the Parliament Complex Jakarta, 2014\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches.[122] Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state.[123] The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (*Tentara Nasional Indonesia*, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[124]\n\n\nThe highest representative body at the national level is the People's Consultative Assembly (*Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat*, MPR). Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the president,[125][126] and formalising broad outlines of state policy. The MPR comprises two houses; the People's Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat*, DPR), with 575 members, and the Regional Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Daerah*, DPD), with 136.[127] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,[122] while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management.[128][126]\n\n\nMost civil disputes appear before the State Court (*Pengadilan Negeri*); appeals are heard before the High Court (*Pengadilan Tinggi*). The Supreme Court of Indonesia (*Mahkamah Agung*) is the highest level of the judicial branch and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Constitutional Court (*Mahkamah Konstitusi*) which listens to constitutional and political matters, and the Religious Court (*Pengadilan Agama*), which deals with codified Islamic Personal Law (*sharia*) cases.[129] Additionally, the Judicial Commission (*Komisi Yudisial*) monitors the performance of judges.[130]\n\n\n\n### Parties and elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of political parties in Indonesia and Elections in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo,  \n 7th President of Indonesia\n![](image)\nMa'ruf Amin,  \n 13th Vice President of Indonesia\n\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which secured the most votes in the 2019 elections, is the party of the incumbent president, Joko Widodo.[131] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups (*Golkar*), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (*Gerindra*), the Democratic Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\nThe first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly (*Konstituante*). The most recent elections in 2019 resulted in nine political parties in the DPR, with a parliamentary threshold of 4% of the national vote.[132] At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.[127][122] Beginning with the 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have occurred on the same date. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections would be held simultaneously, starting in 2019.[133]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Indonesia\n\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah*, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945,[134] with the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022.[135] The second level are the regencies (*kabupaten*) and cities (*kota*), led by regents (*bupati*) and mayors (*walikota*) respectively and a legislature (*DPRD Kabupaten/Kota*). The third level are the districts (*kecamatan*, *distrik* in Papua, or *kapanewon* and *kemantren* in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either *desa*, *kelurahan*, *kampung*, *nagari* in West Sumatra, or *gampong* in Aceh).[136]\n\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (*rukun warga*, RW), which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (*rukun tetangga*, RT). In Java, the village (*desa*) is divided into smaller units called *dusun* or *dukuh* (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles village or neighbourhood matters through an elected village head (*lurah* or *kepala desa*).[137]\n\n\nNine provinces—Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and West Papua—are granted a special autonomous status (*otonomi khusus*) from the central government. A conservative Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing *sharia*.[138] Jakarta is the only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[142]\n\n\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Indonesia provinces labelled map.

Numerous attempts by the United States and the Soviet Union,[146][147] and China to some degree,[148] culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a reorientation of foreign policy.[149] Quiet alignment with the Western world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign policy since then.[150] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit. In common with most of the Muslim world, Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported Palestine. However, observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[151]\n\n\nIndonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[153] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a former member of OPEC.[154] Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1967,[155][156] and recently, the country established its first overseas aid programme in late 2019.[157]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian National Armed Forces and Military history of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian Armed Forces. **Clockwise from top**: Indonesian Army during training session; Sukhoi Su-30; Pindad Anoa; and Indonesian naval vessel Error: {{Ship}} invalid control parameter: 4 (help).\n\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNI–AU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of GDP in 2018,[158] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations.[159] The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia. Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats.[160] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which peaked during the New Order. Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the legislature. Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level.[161]\n\n\nSince independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[162] Some, notably in Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.[163][164][165] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[74] while the latter has continued amid a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses as of 2006.[166] Other engagements of the army include the conflict against the Netherlands over the Dutch New Guinea, the opposition to the British-sponsored creation of Malaysia (\"Konfrontasi\"), the mass killings of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the invasion of East Timor, which remains Indonesia's most massive military operation.[167][168]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Indonesia and Economic history of Indonesia\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Vast palm oil plantation in Bogor Regency, West Java. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil.[169]\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles.[170] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia,[171] the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country. Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.417 trillion and US$4.393 trillion, respectively. Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,835, while nominal per capita GDP is US$5,108.[7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%).[172] Since 2009, it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%).[173]\n\n\nOver time, the structure of the economy has changed considerably.[174] Historically, it has been weighted heavily towards agriculture, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency.[174] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports.[174] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock, during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. As a result, the official poverty rate fell from 60% to 15%.[175] Trade barriers reduction from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally integrated. The growth ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis that severely impacted the economy, including a 13.1% real GDP contraction in 1998 and a 78% inflation. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.[176]\n\n\nRelatively steady inflation[177] and an increase in GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index[178] have contributed to strong economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2019, annual growth accelerated to between 4% and 6% due to improvements in the banking sector and domestic consumption,[179] helping Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession,[180] and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997.[181] As of 2019[update], 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty line, and the official open unemployment rate was 5.28%.[182] During the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the economy suffered its first recession since the 1997 crisis but recovered in the following year.[183]\n\n\nIndonesia has abundant natural resources. Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth, tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans, bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[184] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States, Japan, Singapore, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia's principal export markets and import partners.[185]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTransport modes in Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: TransJakarta bus; Whoosh high-speed train; Garuda Indonesia airliner; and Pelni ship.\n\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java.[186] All transport modes play a role in the country's transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[187]\n\n\nThe road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018[update].[188] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes.[189] Rickshaws such as *bajaj* and *becak* and share taxis such as *Angkot* and *Minibus* are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nMost railways are in Java, and partly Sumatra and Sulawesi,[190] used for freight and passenger transport, such as local commuter rail services (mainly in Greater Jakarta and Yogyakarta–Solo) complementing the inter-city rail network in several cities. In the late 2010s, Jakarta and Palembang were the first cities in Indonesia to have rapid transit systems, with more planned for other cities in the future.[191] In 2023, a high-speed rail connecting the cities of Jakarta and Bandung commenced operations, a first for Southeast Asia and the Southern Hemisphere.[192]\n\n\nIndonesia's largest airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere, serving 54 million passengers in 2019. Ngurah Rai International Airport and Juanda International Airport are the country's second-and third-busiest airport, respectively. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flag carrier since 1949, is one of the world's leading airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam. The Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced Indonesian port,[193] handling more than 50% of Indonesia's trans-shipment cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Sidrap wind farm, Indonesia's first wind power plant, in Sidrap Regency, South Sulawesi\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059 quadrillion British thermal units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043 quadrillion British thermal units) worth of energy.[194] The country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.[195]\n\n\nIn late 2020, Indonesia's total national installed power generation capacity stands at 72,750.72 MW.[196] Although reliance on domestic coal and imported oil has increased between 2010 and 2019,[194][197] Indonesia has seen progress in renewable energy, with hydropower and geothermal being the most abundant sources that account for more than 8% in the country's energy mix.[194] A prime example of the former is the country's largest dam, Jatiluhur, which has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW that feeds into the Java grid managed by the State Electricity Company (*Perusahaan Listrik Negara*, PLN). Furthermore, Indonesia has the potential for solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy,[198] although as of 2021, power generation from these sources remain small.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Palapa satellite launch in 1984\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019),[199] and Indonesia only ranked 61st on the 2023 Global Innovation Index report up from 87th in 2021.[200][201] Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique *terasering*, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people.[202] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in several countries.[203] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad.[204]\n\n\nIndonesia has a long history of developing military and small commuter aircraft. It is the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft. The state-owned Indonesian Aerospace company (*PT. Dirgantara Indonesia*) has provided components for Boeing and Airbus.[205] The company also collaborated with EADS CASA of Spain to develop the CN-235, which has been used by several countries.[206] Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this achievement.[207] Indonesia has also joined the South Korean programme to manufacture the 4.5-generation fighter jet KAI KF-21 Boramae.[208]\n\n\nIndonesia has a space programme and space agency, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (*Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional*, LAPAN). In the 1970s, Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system called Palapa,[209] a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1, was launched on 8 July 1976 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.[210] As of 2019[update], Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for various purposes.[211]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Indonesia\n![](image)Borobudur in Central Java, the world's largest Buddhist temple, is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.[212]\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors.[213] Overall, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia.[214] Since 2011, *Wonderful Indonesia* has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism.[215]\n\n\n\n![](image)Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua, has the highest recorded level of diversity in marine life, according to Conservation International.[216]\nNature and culture are prime attractions of Indonesian tourism. The country has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rainforests stretching over about 57% of Indonesia's land (225 million acres). Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of the world's longest coastlines, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999 mi). The ancient Borobudur and Prambanan temples, as well as Toraja and Bali with their traditional festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.[217]\n\n\nIndonesia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Komodo National Park and the Sawahlunto Coal Mine; and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes Bunaken National Park and Raja Ampat Islands.[218] Other attractions include specific points in Indonesian history, such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East Indies in the old towns of Jakarta and Semarang and the royal palaces of Pagaruyung, Ubud, and Yogyakarta.[217]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Indonesia and Indonesians\n\nSee also: List of Indonesian cities by population and List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Indonesia's ten metropolitan areas labeled with their populations\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%.[219] Java is the world's most populous island,[220] where 56% of the country's population lives.[6] The population density is 141 people per km2 (365 per sq mi),[6] ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 (2,435 per sq mi). In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people.[221] It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050.[222] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate).[77]\n\n\nThe spread of the population is uneven throughout the archipelago, with a varying habitats and levels of development, ranging from the megacity of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in Papua.[223] As of 2017, about 54.7% of the population lives in urban areas.[224] Jakarta is the country's primate city and the second-most populous urban area globally, with over 34 million residents.[225] About 8 million Indonesians live overseas; most settled in Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, South Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia.[226]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities in Indonesia2023 BPS estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Jakarta](image)Jakarta![Surabaya](image)Surabaya | 1 | Jakarta | Special Capital Region of Jakarta | 11,350,328 | 11 | South Tangerang | Banten | 1,404,785\n | ![Bekasi](image)Bekasi![Bandung](image)Bandung |\n| 2 | Surabaya | East Java | 3,009,286 | 12 | Batam | Riau Islands | 1,269,820\n |\n| 3 | Bekasi | West Java | 2,627,207 | 13 | Bandar Lampung | Lampung | 1,209,937\n |\n| 4 | Bandung | West Java | 2,506,603 | 14 | Bogor | West Java | 1,127,408\n |\n| 5 | Medan | North Sumatra | 2,494,512 | 15 | Pekanbaru | Riau | 1,007,540\n |\n| 6 | Depok | West Java | 2,145,400 | 16 | Padang | West Sumatra | 919,145\n |\n| 7 | Tangerang | Banten | 1,912,679 | 17 | Malang | East Java | 847,182\n |\n| 8 | Palembang | South Sumatra | 1,729,546 | 18 | Samarinda | East Kalimantan | 834,824\n |\n| 9 | Semarang | Central Java | 1,694,740 | 19 | Tasikmalaya | West Java | 741,760\n |\n| 10 | Makassar | South Sulawesi | 1,474,393 | 20 | Denpasar | Bali | 726,808\n |\n\n### Ethnic groups and languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethnic groups in Indonesia, Native Indonesians, and Languages of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A map of ethnic groups in Indonesia\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups.[2] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands).[23][227][228][229]\n\n\nThe Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,[2] and are politically dominant.[230] They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also in sizeable numbers in most provinces. The Sundanese are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, Bugis and Malay people.[d] A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[231]\n\n\nThe country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, which had been the archipelago's *lingua franca* for centuries. It was promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945 under the name *Bahasa Indonesia*.[232] Due to centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences.[e] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages,[1] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[1] Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken[77] and has co-official status in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.[236]\n\n\nIn 1930, Dutch and other Europeans (*Totok*), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of the total population.[237] Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today. Also, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years.[238] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[239] Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[240] as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.[241]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hindu prayer ceremony at Besakih Temple in Bali, the only Indonesian province where Hinduism is the predominant religion\nThe natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous animism and dynamism, beliefs that are common to Austronesian peoples.[252] They worshipped and revered ancestral spirits and believed that supernatural spirits (*hyang*) might inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or sacred sites.[252] Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese Sunda Wiwitan, Dayak's Kaharingan, and the Javanese Kejawèn. They have significantly impacted how other faiths are practised, evidenced by a large proportion of people—such as the Javanese abangan, Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christians—practising a less orthodox, syncretic form of their religion.[253]\n\n\nHindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE.[254] The Sundanese Kingdom of Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first historically recorded Indianised kingdom in the archipelago.[255] Buddhism arrived around the 6th century,[256] and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhism had their roots around the same period. The archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit, Sailendra, Srivijaya, and Mataram. Though no longer a majority, Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture.[257][258]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh, Aceh. The spread of Islam in Indonesia began in the region.\nIslam was introduced by Sunni traders of the Shafi'i school as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern Arabia as early as the 8th century CE.[259][260] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, resulting in a distinct form of Islam (*santri*).[32][261] Trade, Islamic missionary activity such as by the Wali Sanga and Chinese explorer Zheng He, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of Islam.[262][263] By the end of the 16th century, it had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra.\n\n\n\n![](image)Catholic Mass at the Jakarta Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought by Portuguese traders and missionaries such as Jesuit Francis Xavier, who visited and baptised several thousand locals.[264][265] Its spread faced difficulty due to the Dutch East India Company policy of banning the religion and the Dutch hostility due to the Eighty Years' War against Catholic Spain's rule. Protestantism is mostly a result of Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the Dutch colonial era.[266][267][268] Although they are the most common branch, there is a multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country.[269]\n\n\nThere was a small Jewish presence in the archipelago until 1945, mostly Dutch and some Baghdadi Jews. Since most left after Indonesia proclaimed independence, Judaism was never accorded official status, and only a tiny number of Jews remain today, mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya.[270]\n\n\nAt the national and local level, Indonesia's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith relations, both positively and negatively. The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation, Pancasila[271][272] (i.e. the belief in the one and only God), often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance,[273] though instances of intolerance have occurred.[274][73] An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential and an integral part of life.[275][276]\n\n\n\n### Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Indonesia and Health in Indonesia\n\n![](image)University of Indonesia is one of Indonesia's top universities\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years.[277] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[278] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018).[279] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[279] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java.[280][281] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[282]\n\n\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016.[283] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (*Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional*, JKN) in 2014.[284] It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme. Despite remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019)[285] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019),[286] challenges remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases.[287]\n\n\n\n### Issues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in Indonesia, Organised crime in Indonesia, and Papua conflict\n\n![](image)Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14 May 1998\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua).[288][289] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago[290] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\nIn the social arena, numerous cases of racism and discrimination, especially against Chinese Indonesians and Papuans, have been well documented throughout Indonesia's history.[291][292] Such cases have sometimes led to violent conflicts, most notably the May 1998 riots and the Papua conflict, which has continued since 1962. LGBT people also regularly face challenges. Although LGBT issues have been relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of anti-LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation, discrimination, and even violence.[293][294] In addition, Indonesia has been reported to have sizeable numbers of child and forced labourers, with the former being prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing industry.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Indonesia\n See also: National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia and Public holidays in Indonesia\n\nThe cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia. Influences from the Indian subcontinent, mainland China, the Middle East, Europe,[297][298] Melanesian and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago. As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and multi-ethnic society,[1][2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures. Indonesia currently holds twelve items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik,[299] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance.[300]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian art and Architecture of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: Indonesian painting\n\n![](image)Traditional Balinese painting depicting cockfighting\nIndonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity, Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab world, China and Europe, due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade.[301] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry. Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on *candi* bas reliefs in eastern Java.[302]\n\n\n\n![](image)An avenue of Tongkonan houses in a Torajan village, South Sulawesi\nThere have been numerous discoveries of megalithic sculptures in Indonesia.[303] Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak and Toraja.[304][305] Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the 8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation developed refined stone sculpting art and architecture influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. The temples of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the practice.[306]\n\n\nAs with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have brought cultural changes and profound effects on building styles and techniques. The most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant. Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses' (*rumah adat*) styles that have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements vary by ethnic group, and each has a specific custom and history.[307] Examples include Toraja's Tongkonan, Minangkabau's Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay houses, Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of rice barns (*lumbung*).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music, dance and clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Indonesia, Dance in Indonesia, and National costume of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian music and dance. **Clockwise from top**: a gamelan player; Angklung; Sundanese Jaipongan Mojang Priangan dance; and Balinese Pendet dance.\n\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals. Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments. The diverse world of Indonesian music genres results from the musical creativity of its people and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences. These include gambus and qasida from the Middle East,[308] keroncong from Portugal,[309] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with notable Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras.[310] Today, the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei,[311][312] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay.[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cotton wikkelrok with batik geometric pattern\nIndonesian dances have a diverse history, with more than 3,000 original dances. Scholars believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[314] Examples include war dances, a dance of witch doctors, and a dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals such as Hudoq. Indonesian dances derive their influences from the archipelago's prehistoric and tribal, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic periods. Recently, modern dances and urban teen dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture and those of Japan and South Korea to some extent. However, various traditional dances, including those of Java, Bali and Dayak, remain a living and dynamic tradition.[315]\n\n\nIndonesia has various clothing styles due to its long and rich cultural history. The national costume originates from the country's indigenous culture and traditional textile traditions. The Javanese Batik and Kebaya[316] are arguably Indonesia's most recognised national costumes, though they have Sundanese and Balinese origins as well.[317] Each province has a representation of traditional attire and dress,[297] such as Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra; Songket of Malay and Minangkabau from Sumatra; and Ikat of Sasak from Lombok. People wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings, formal ceremonies, music performances, government and official occasions,[317] and they vary from traditional to modern attire.\n\n\n\n### Theatre and cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theatre of Indonesia and Cinema of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: List of highest-grossing films in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Pandava and Krishna in an act of the *Wayang Wong* performance\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata.[318] Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong,[319][320] and various Balinese dance dramas. They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances.[321] Some theatre traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals[322][323] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story.[323] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as *Teater Koma* are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society.[324]\n\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Loetoeng Kasaroeng* (1926), the first fiction film produced in the Dutch East Indies\nThe first film produced in the archipelago was *Loetoeng Kasaroeng*,[325] a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. The film industry expanded after independence, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. Usmar Ismail, who made significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s, is generally considered the pioneer of Indonesian films.[326] The latter part of the Sukarno era saw the use of cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes, and foreign films were subsequently banned, while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order.[327] Production of films peaked during the 1980s, although it declined significantly in the next decade.[325] Notable films in this period include *Pengabdi Setan* (1980), *Nagabonar* (1987), *Tjoet Nja' Dhien* (1988), *Catatan Si Boy* (1989), and Warkop's comedy films.\n\n\nIndependent film making was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998, when films started addressing previously banned topics, such as religion, race, and love.[327] Between 2000 and 2005, the number of films released each year steadily increased.[328] Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed *Kuldesak* (1999), *Petualangan Sherina* (2000), *Ada Apa dengan Cinta?* (2002), and *Laskar Pelangi* (2008). In 2022, *KKN di Desa Penari* smashed box office records, becoming the most-watched Indonesian film with 9.2 million tickets sold.[329] Indonesia has held annual film festivals and awards, including the Indonesian Film Festival (*Festival Film Indonesia*) held intermittently since 1955. It hands out the Citra Award, the film industry's most prestigious award. From 1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued until its revival in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Mass media and literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mass media in Indonesia and Indonesian literature\n\n![](image)Metro TV at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, reporting the 2010 AFF Championship\nMedia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media.[330] The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989. By the early 21st century, the improved communications system had brought television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11 channels.[331] Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes. The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998.[331]\n\n\nLike other developing countries, Indonesia began developing Internet in the early 1990s. Its first commercial Internet service provider, PT. Indo Internet began operation in Jakarta in 1994.[332] The country had 171 million Internet users in 2018, with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually.[333] Most are between the ages of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on mobile phones for access, outnumbering laptops and computers.[334]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's most famous novelist. Many considered him to be Southeast Asia's leading candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.[335]\nThe oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia's peoples have firmly rooted oral traditions, which help define and preserve their cultural identities.[336] In written poetry and prose, several traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, hikayat and babad. Examples of these forms include *Syair Abdul Muluk*, *Hikayat Hang Tuah*, *Sulalatus Salatin*, and *Babad Tanah Jawi*.[337]\n\n\nEarly modern Indonesian literature originates in the Sumatran tradition.[338][339] Literature and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence. Balai Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted in 1917 to promote the development of indigenous literature. Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the Golden Age of Indonesian Literature.[340] The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian literature vary according to the dynamics of the country's political and social landscape,[340] most notably the war of independence in the second half of the 1940s and the anti-communist mass killings in the mid-1960s.[341] Notable literary figures of the modern era include Hamka, Chairil Anwar, Mohammad Yamin, Merari Siregar, Marah Roesli, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Ayu Utami.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian cuisine\n\n![](image)*Nasi Padang* with *rendang*, *gulai* and vegetables\nIndonesian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse, vibrant, and colourful, full of intense flavour.[342] Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents.[343] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably chilli), coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[344]\n\n\nSome popular dishes such as *nasi goreng*, *gado-gado*, *sate*, and *soto* are ubiquitous and considered national dishes. The Ministry of Tourism, however, chose *tumpeng* as the official national dish in 2014, describing it as binding the diversity of various culinary traditions.[345] Other popular dishes include *rendang*, one of the many Minangkabau cuisines along with *dendeng* and *gulai*. Another fermented food is *oncom*, similar in some ways to *tempeh* but uses a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and is prevalent in West Java.[346]\n\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in Indonesia and Indonesian martial arts\n\n![](image)A demonstration of *Pencak Silat*, a form of martial artsBadminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia. Indonesia is among the few countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's and women's badminton. Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia's Olympic medal tally. Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league. On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as the Dutch East Indies.[347] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as three gold medals at the 1987, 1991 and 2023 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 and successfully qualified for a total of five tournaments, although they never make the knockout phase.[348]\n\n\nOther popular sports include boxing and basketball, which has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first National Games (*Pekan Olahraga Nasional*, PON) in 1948.[349] *Sepak takraw* and *karapan sapi* (bull racing) in Madura are some examples of Indonesia's traditional sports. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as *caci* in Flores and *pasola* in Sumba. *Pencak Silat* is an Indonesian martial art and, in 2018, became one of the sporting events in the Asian Games, with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the top sports powerhouses by topping the SEA Games medal table ten times since 1977,[350] most recently in 2011.[351]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* List of Indonesia-related topics\n* Index of Indonesia-related articles\n* Outline of Indonesia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** UK: /ˌɪndəˈniːziə, -ʒə/ *IN-də-NEE-zee-ə, -⁠zhə* US: /ˌɪndəˈniːʒə, -ʃə/ ⓘ *IN-də-NEE-zhə, -⁠shə*;[10][11] Indonesian pronunciation: [ɪndoˈnesia]\n2. **^** *Republik Indonesia* ([reˈpublik ɪndoˈnesia] ⓘ) is the most-used official name, though the name Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (*Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia*, NKRI) also appears in some official documents.\n3. **^** During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Indonesia withdrew from the UN due to the latter's election to the United Nations Security Council, although it returned 18 months later.

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the south and west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon River.[9] Peru has a population of over 32 million, and its capital and largest city is Lima. At 1,285,216 km2 (496,225 sq mi), Peru is the 19th largest country in the world, and the third largest in South America.\n\n\nPeruvian territory was home to several cultures during the ancient and medieval periods, and has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 10th millennium BCE. Notable pre-colonial cultures and civilizations include the Caral-Supe civilization (the earliest civilization in the Americas and considered one of the cradles of civilization), the Nazca culture, the Wari and Tiwanaku empires, the Kingdom of Cusco, and the Inca Empire, the largest known state in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and Charles V established a viceroyalty with the official name of the Kingdom of Peru that encompassed most of its South American territories, with its capital in Lima. Higher education started in the Americas with the official establishment of the National University of San Marcos in Lima in 1551.\n\n\nPeru formally proclaimed independence in 1821, and following the foreign military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar, and the decisive battle of Ayacucho, Peru completed its independence in 1824. In the ensuing years, the country first suffered from political instability until a period of relative economic and political stability began due to the exploitation of guano that ended with the War of the Pacific (1879–1884). Throughout the 20th century, Peru grappled with political and social instability, including the internal conflict between the state and guerrilla groups, interspersed with periods of economic growth. Implementation of *Plan Verde*[10][11] shifted Peru towards neoliberal economics under the authoritarian rule of Alberto Fujimori and Vladimiro Montesinos in the 1990s, with the former's political ideology of Fujimorism leaving a lasting imprint on the country's governance that continues to present day.[12][13] The 2000s marked economic expansion and poverty reduction, but the subsequent decade revealed long-existing sociopolitical vulnerabilities, exacerbated by a political crisis instigated by Congress and the COVID-19 pandemic, precipitating the period of unrest beginning in 2022.[14]\n\n\nThe sovereign state of Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions. Its main economic activities include mining, manufacturing, agriculture and fishing, along with other growing sectors such as telecommunications and biotechnology.[15] The country forms part of The Pacific Pumas, a political and economic grouping of countries along Latin America's Pacific coast that share common trends of positive growth, stable macroeconomic foundations, improved governance and an openness to global integration. Peru ranks high in social freedom;[16] it is an active member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Pacific Alliance, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the World Trade Organization; and is considered as a middle power.[17]\n\n\nPeru has a population that includes Mestizos, Amerindians, Europeans, Africans and Asians. The main spoken language is Spanish, although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechuan languages, Aymara, or other Indigenous languages. This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the country may be derived from *Birú*, the name of a local ruler who lived near the Bay of San Miguel, Panama City, in the early 16th century.[18] Spanish conquistadors, who arrived in 1522, believed this was the southernmost part of the New World.[19] When Francisco Pizarro invaded the regions farther south, they came to be designated *Birú* or *Perú*.[20]\n\n\nAn alternative history is provided by the contemporary writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, son of an Inca princess and a conquistador. He said the name *Birú* was that of a common Amerindian who was happened upon by the crew of a ship on an exploratory mission for governor Pedro Arias Dávila and went on to relate more instances of misunderstandings due to the lack of a common language.[21]\n\n\nThe Spanish Crown gave the name legal status with the 1529 *Capitulación de Toledo*, which designated the newly encountered Inca Empire as the province of Peru.[22] In 1561, the rebel Lope de Aguirre declared himself the \"Prince\" of an independent Peru, which was cut short by his arrest and execution. Under Spanish rule, the country adopted the denomination *Viceroyalty of Peru*, which became the *Peruvian Republic* from its independence until 1979, when it adopted its current name of *Republic of Peru*.[23]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Peru\n\nSee also: Periodization of pre-Columbian Peru, Agricultural history of Peru, and Economic history of Peru\n\n### Prehistory and Pre-Columbian Peru[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pre-Columbian Peru and Andean civilizations\n\n![](image)Remains of a Caral/Norte Chico pyramid in the arid Supe Valley\nThe earliest evidences of human presence in Peruvian territory have been dated to approximately 12,500 BCE in the Huaca Prieta settlement.[24] Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as irrigation and terracing; camelid husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on reciprocity and redistribution because these societies had no notion of market or money.[25] The oldest known complex society in Peru, the Caral/Norte Chico civilization, flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3,000 and 1,800 BCE.[26] These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures that developed mostly around the coastal and Andean regions throughout Peru. The Cupisnique culture which flourished from around 1000 to 200 BCE[27] along what is now Peru's Pacific coast was an example of early pre-Inca culture.\n\n\n\n![](image)Moche earrings depicting warriors, made of turquoise and gold (1–800 CE)\nThe Chavín culture that developed from 1500 to 300 BCE was probably more of a religious than a political phenomenon, with their religious center in Chavín de Huantar.[28] After the decline of the Chavin culture around the beginning of the 1st century CE, a series of localized and specialized cultures rose and fell, both on the coast and in the highlands, during the next thousand years. On the coast, these included the civilizations of the Paracas, Nazca, Wari, and the more outstanding Chimu and Moche.\n\n\n\nThe Moche, who reached their apogee in the first millennium CE, were renowned for their irrigation system which fertilized their arid terrain, their sophisticated ceramic pottery, their lofty buildings, and clever metalwork.[29] The Chimu were the great city builders of pre-Inca civilization; as a loose confederation of walled cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru, the Chimu flourished from about 1140 to 1450.[30] Their capital was at Chan Chan outside of modern-day Trujillo.[30] In the highlands, both the Tiahuanaco culture, near Lake Titicaca in both Peru and Bolivia,[31] and the Wari culture, near the present-day city of Ayacucho, developed large urban settlements and wide-ranging state systems between 500 and 1000 CE.[32]\n\n![](image)The citadel of Machu Picchu, an iconic symbol of pre-Columbian PeruIn the 15th century, the Incas emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the largest empire in the pre-Columbian Americas with their capital in Cusco.[33] The Incas of Cusco originally represented one of the small and relatively minor ethnic groups, the Quechuas. Gradually, as early as the thirteenth century, they began to expand and incorporate their neighbors. Inca expansion was slow until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when the pace of conquest began to accelerate, particularly under the rule of the emperor Pachacuti.[34] Under his rule and that of his son, Topa Inca Yupanqui, the Incas came to control most of the Andean region, with a population of 9 to 16 million inhabitants under their rule. Pachacuti also promulgated a comprehensive code of laws to govern his far-flung empire, while consolidating his absolute temporal and spiritual authority as the God of the Sun who ruled from a magnificently rebuilt Cusco.[35] From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, from southern Colombia to northern Chile, between the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Amazon rainforest in the east. The official language of the empire was Quechua,[36] although hundreds of local languages and dialects were spoken. The Inca referred to their empire as *Tawantinsuyu* which can be translated as \"The Four Regions\" or \"The Four United Provinces.\" Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred *Huacas*, but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of Inti, the sun god and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama.[37] The Incas considered their King, the Sapa Inca, to be the \"child of the sun.\"[38]\n\n\n### Conquest and colonial period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spanish conquest of Peru and Viceroyalty of Peru\n\n![](image)One of the main events in the conquest of Peru was the death of Atahualpa, the last Sapa Inca, executed by the Spaniards on 29 August 1533\nAtahualpa (also Atahuallpa), the last Sapa Inca, became emperor when he defeated and executed his older half-brother Huáscar in a civil war sparked by the death of their father, Inca Huayna Capac. In December 1532, a party of *conquistadors* (supported by the Chankas, Huancas, Cañaris and Chachapoyas as Indian auxiliaries) led by Francisco Pizarro defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in the Battle of Cajamarca. The Spanish conquest of Peru was one of the most important campaigns in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the Viceroyalty of Peru with its capital at Lima, which was then known as \"La Ciudad de los Reyes\" (The City of Kings). The conquest of Peru led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba in 1572.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cusco\nThe Indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish as well as exploitation and socio-economic change.[39] Viceroy Francisco de Toledo reorganized the country in the 1570s with gold and silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian forced labor as its primary workforce.[40] With the discovery of the great silver and gold lodes at Potosí (present-day Bolivia) and Huancavelica, the viceroyalty flourished as an important provider of mineral resources. Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines.[41] The commercial and population exchanges between Latin America and Asia undergone via the Manila Galleons transiting through Acapulco, had Callao at Peru as the furthest endpoint of the trade route in the Americas.[42] In relation to this, Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, governor of Panama was also responsible for settling Zamboanga City in the Philippines, which now speak a Spanish Creole by employing Peruvian soldiers and colonists.[43] Because of lack of available workforce, African slaves were added to the labor population. The expansion of a colonial administrative apparatus and bureaucracy paralleled the economic reorganization. With the conquest started the spread of Christianity in South America; most people were forcefully converted to Catholicism, with Spanish clerics believing like Puritan divines of English colonies later that the Native Peoples \"had been corrupted by the Devil, who was working \"through them to frustrate\" their foundations.[44] It only took a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the Coricancha in the city of Cusco. The church employed the Inquisition, making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs, and monastery schools, educating girls, especially of the Inca nobility and upper class, \"until they were old enough either to profess [to become a nun] or to leave the monastery and assume the role ('estado') in the Christian society that their fathers planned to erect\" in Peru.[45] Peruvian Catholicism follows the syncretism found in many Latin American countries, in which religious native rituals have been integrated with Christian celebrations.[46] In this endeavor, the church came to play an important role in the acculturation of the Natives, drawing them into the cultural orbit of the Spanish settlers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Colonial Arequipa\nBy the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income.[47] In response, the Crown enacted the Bourbon Reforms, a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty.[48] The new laws provoked Túpac Amaru II's rebellion and other revolts, all of which were suppressed.[49] As a result of these and other changes, the Spaniards and their creole successors came to monopolize control over the land, seizing many of the best lands abandoned by the massive native depopulation. However, the Spanish did not resist the Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian. The Treaty of Tordesillas was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while Spain controlled Portugal. The need to ease communication and trade with Spain led to the split of the viceroyalty and the creation of new viceroyalties of New Granada and Rio de la Plata at the expense of the territories that formed the Viceroyalty of Peru; this reduced the power, prominence and importance of Lima as the viceroyal capital and shifted the lucrative Andean trade to Buenos Aires and Bogotá, while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\n\n\n![](image)Juan Santos and his supporters confronting Franciscan priests.\nEventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the Spanish empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These movements led to the formation of the majority of modern-day countries of South America in the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of Peru.[50] The conquest and colony brought a mix of cultures and ethnicities that did not exist before the Spanish conquered the Peruvian territory. Even though many of the Inca traditions were lost or diluted, new customs, traditions and knowledge were added, creating a rich mixed Peruvian culture.[46] Two of the most important Indigenous rebellions against the Spanish were that of Juan Santos Atahualpa in 1742, and Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II in 1780 around the highlands near Cuzco.[51]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peruvian War of Independence\n\n![](image)The Battle of Ayacucho was decisive in ensuring Peruvian independence.\nIn the early 19th century, while most South American nations were swept by wars of independence, Peru remained a royalist stronghold. As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish monarchy, independence was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar.\n\n\nThe economic crises, the loss of power of Spain in Europe, the war of independence in North America, and Native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipation ideas among the C*riollo* population in South America. However, the Criollo oligarchy in Peru enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. The liberation movement started in Argentina where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its colonies.\n\n\nAfter fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, José de San Martín created the Army of the Andes and crossed the Andes in 21 days. Once in Chile, he joined forces with Chilean army General Bernardo O'Higgins and liberated the country in the battles of Chacabuco and Maipú in 1818.[52] On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of Paracas under the command of General José de San Martin and Thomas Cochrane, who was serving in the Chilean Navy. Immediately on 26 October, they took control of the town of Pisco. San Martin settled in Huacho on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north and blockaded the port of Callao in Lima. At the same time in the north, Guayaquil was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin's strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the Viceroy that Peru be granted independence, however, all negotiations proved unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n![](image)San Martín proclaiming the independence of Peru. Painting by Juan Lepiani.The Viceroy of Peru, Joaquín de la Pazuela named José de la Serna commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion by San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a coup against de la Pazuela, which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. To avoid a military confrontation, San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, José de la Serna, and proposed to create a constitutional monarchy, a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city, and on 12 July 1821, San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. Upper Peru (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of Simón Bolívar liberated it three years later. José de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a Latin American Confederation floundered and a union with Bolivia proved ephemeral.[53]\n\n\nSimon Bolivar launched his campaign from the north, liberating the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the Battles of Carabobo in 1821 and Pichincha a year later. In July 1822, Bolivar and San Martin gathered in the Guayaquil Conference. Bolivar was left in charge of fully liberating Peru while San Martin retired from politics after the first parliament was assembled. The newly founded Peruvian Congress named Bolivar dictator of Peru, giving him the power to organize the military.\n\n\nWith the help of Antonio José de Sucre, they defeated the larger Spanish army in the Battle of Junín on 6 August 1824 and the decisive Battle of Ayacucho on 9 December of the same year, consolidating the independence of Peru and Alto Peru. Alto Peru was later established as Bolivia. During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.[54]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Battle of Angamos, during the War of the Pacific\nFrom the 1840s to the 1860s, Peru enjoyed a period of stability under the presidency of Ramón Castilla, through increased state revenues from guano exports.[55] However, by the 1870s, these resources had been depleted, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.[56] Peru embarked on a railroad-building program that helped but also bankrupted the country.\n\n\nIn 1879, Peru entered the War of the Pacific which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The Peruvian Government tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the department of Tarapacá and the provinces of Tacna and Arica, in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were Francisco Bolognesi and Miguel Grau. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The signing of the Rio Protocol in January 1942\nInternal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the Civilista Party, which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of Augusto B. Leguía. The Great Depression caused the downfall of Leguía, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA).[57] The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the Treaty of Lima, returned Tacna to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a year-long war with Colombia over a territorial dispute involving the Amazonas Department and its capital Leticia.\n\n\nLater, in 1941, Peru and Ecuador fought the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War, after which the Rio Protocol sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General Manuel A. Odría became president. Odría's presidency was known as the *Ochenio*. He came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, civil rights were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his regime. Odría was succeeded by Manuel Prado Ugarteche. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, via a coup d'état led by Ricardo Pérez Godoy. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Fernando Belaúnde Terry who assumed presidency until 1968. Belaúnde was recognized for his commitment to the democratic process.\n\n\nOn October 3, 1968, another coup d'état led by a group of officers led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado brought the army to power with the aim of applying a doctrine of \"social progress and integral development\", nationalist and reformist, influenced by the CEPAL theses on dependence and underdevelopment. Six days after the golpe, Velasco proceeded to nationalize the *International Petroleum Corporation* (IPC), the North American company that exploited Peruvian oil, and then launched a reform of the state apparatus, an agrarian reform. It was the biggest agrarian reform ever undertaken in Latin America: it abolished the latifunda system and modernized agriculture through a more equitable redistribution of land (90% of the peasants formed cooperatives or agricultural societies of social interest). Land was to be owned by those who cultivated it, and large landowners were expropriated. The only large properties allowed were cooperatives. Between 1969 and 1976, 325,000 families received land from the state with an average size of 73.6 acres. The \"revolutionary government\" also planned massive investments in education, elevated the Quechua language – spoken by nearly half the population but hitherto despised by the authorities – to a status equivalent to that of Spanish and established equal rights for natural children. Peru wished to free itself from any dependence and carried out a third-world foreign policy. The United States responded with commercial, economic and diplomatic pressure. In 1973, Peru seemed to triumph over the financial blockade imposed by Washington by negotiating a loan from the International Development Bank to finance its agricultural and mining development policy. The relations with Chile became very tense after the coup d'état of the general Pinochet. General Edgardo Mercado Jarrin (Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army) and Admiral Guillermo Faura Gaig (Minister of the Navy) both escaped assassination attempts within weeks of each other. In 1975, General Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerruti seized power and broke with the policies of his predecessor. His regime occasionally participated in Operation Condor in collaboration with other American military dictatorships.[58][59]\n\n\nPeru engaged in a two week long conflict with Ecuador during the Paquisha War in early 1981 as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. The economic policy President Alan García distanced Peru from international markets further, resulting in lower foreign investment in the country.[60] After the country experienced chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the sol, was replaced by the *Inti* in mid-1985, which itself was later replaced by the nuevo sol in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's GDP dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and MRTA, which caused great havoc throughout the country.[61][62] The Shining Path had appeared in the universities in the 1970s. These students, many of them from peasant backgrounds, then returned to their communities and organized local party committees. The abandonment by the state of certain rural regions favored the establishment of the party. In June 1979, demonstrations for free education were severely repressed by the army: 18 people were killed according to the official report, but non-governmental estimates put the death toll at several dozen. This event led to a radicalization of political protests in the countryside and eventually to the outbreak of armed struggle. After the beginning of the armed struggle, the new recruits of the Shining Path were generally peasants with little political background, rather than truly political militants.[63]\n\n\nThe Peruvian armed forces grew frustrated with the inability of the García administration to handle the nation's crises and drafted Plan Verde – which involved the genocide of impoverished and indigenous Peruvians, the control or censorship of the media in Peru and the establishment of a neoliberal economy controlled by a military junta in Peru – as an effort to overthrow his government.[64][65][66][67] Alberto Fujimori assumed the presidency in 1990 and according to Rospigliosi, the head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) General Edwin \"Cucharita\" Díaz and Vladimiro Montesinos played a key role with making President Fujimori abide by the military's demands while \"an understanding was established between Fujimori, Montesinos and some of the military officers\" involved in Plan Verde prior to Fujimori's inauguration.[68][69] Fujimori would go on to adopt many of the policies outlined in Plan Verde.[67][69] Fujimori's policies, prescribed by Hernando de Soto, led to the immediate suffering of poor Peruvians who saw unregulated prices increase rapidly, with those living in poverty seeing prices increase so much that they could no longer afford food.[70] De Soto advocated for the collapse of Peru's society, with the economist saying that a civil crisis was necessary to support the policies of Fujimori.[71] These drastic measures caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991 and 57% in 1992.[61][62] The description of Fujimori's economic achievements as a \"Peruvian miracle\" was exaggerated and inequality persisted following his presidency.[72]\n\n\nDue to his controversial governance, Fujimori faced opposition to his reform efforts and utilized coup proposals from Plan Verde, dissolving Congress, suspending the judiciary, arresting several opposition leaders and assuming full powers in the *auto-golpe* (\"self-coup\") of 5 April 1992.[73][67][74] He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by insurgent groups, most notably Shining Path, which carried out attacks across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the Barrios Altos massacre and La Cantuta massacre by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of Tarata and Frecuencia Latina by Sendero Luminoso. Fujimori would also broaden the definition of terrorism in an effort to criminalize as many actions possible to persecute left-wing political opponents.[12] Using the *terruqueo*, a fearmongering tactic that was used to accuse opponents of terrorism, Fujimori established a cult of personality by portraying himself as a hero and made left-wing ideologies an eternal enemy in Peru.[12] Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the human rights violations committed in the last years of violence.[75] His Programa Nacional de Población – an implementation of one of Plan Verde's proposals for the \"total extermination\" of impoverished Peruvians that would possibly be sympathetic to insurgent groups – also resulted with the forced sterilization of at least 300,000 poor and indigenous women.[68][76][77]\n\n\nIn early 1995, once again Peru and Ecuador clashed in the Cenepa War, but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed exile, initially avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities.[78]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2017–present Peruvian political crisis and 2022–2023 Peruvian protests\n\nInto the new century, Peru tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth,[78] though Fujimorism held power over much of Peruvian society through maintaining control of institutions and legislation created in the 1993 constitution, which was written by Fujimori and his supporters without opposition participation.[12] In spite of human rights progress since the time of insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization of those who suffered through the violence of the Peruvian conflict.[79] A caretaker government presided over by Valentín Paniagua took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections. Afterwards Alejandro Toledo became president in 2001 to 2006. On 28 July 2006, former president Alan García became President of Peru after winning the 2006 elections. In 2006, Alberto Fujimori's daughter, Keiko Fujimori, entered Peru's political arena to continue her father's legacy and espouse Fujimorism.[80][81][82] In May 2008, Peru became a member of the Union of South American Nations. In April 2009, former president Alberto Fujimori was convicted of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the Grupo Colina death squad during his government's battle against leftist guerrillas in the 1990s.[83]\n\n\nDuring the presidencies of Ollanta Humala, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Martín Vizcarra, the right-wing Congress led by Keiko Fujimori obstructed much of the actions performed by the presidents.[84][85] On 5 June 2011, Ollanta Humala was elected president, with his cabinet being successfully censured by the Fujimorist Congress.[86] Beginning with Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Congress used broadly interpreted impeachment wording in the 1993 Constitution of Peru that allowed impeachment of the president without cause[87][88][89][90] to place pressure on the president, forcing him to resign in 2018 amid various controversies surrounding his administration. Vice president Martín Vizcarra then assumed office in March 2018 with generally favorable approval ratings as he led the anti-corruption constitutional referendum movement.[91][92] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted with Peru experiencing the highest death rate from COVID-19 in the world, exposing much of the inequality that persisted since the Fujimori administration[72] and triggering an economic crisis that led to Vizcara's removal from the presidency by Congress.[93] Widely seen as a coup by Congress, its head, the newly seated President Manuel Merino, faced protests across the country, and after five days, Merino resigned from the presidency.[94] Merino was replaced by President Francisco Sagasti, who led a provisional, centrist government, and enforced many of Vizcarra's former policies.[95] Elections were held on 11 April 2021, and Pedro Castillo of the Free Peru party won the first round, followed closely by Keiko Fujimori, with right-wing parties allied with Fujimori maintaining positions in Congress.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)Demonstrations in Lima during the 2022–2023 Peruvian political protestsOn 28 July 2021, Pedro Castillo was sworn in as the new president of Peru after a narrow win in a tightly contested run-off election.[97] That same year, Peru celebrated the bicentenary of independence.[98] Castillo faced multiple impeachment votes during his presidency from the right-wing controlled Congress and on 7 December 2022, just hours before Congress was set to begin a third impeachment effort, Castillo tried to prevent this by attempting to dissolve the opposition-controlled legislature and create an \"exceptional emergency government.\" In response, Congress quickly held an emergency session on the same day, during which it voted 101–6 (with 10 abstentions) to remove Castillo from office and replace him with Vice President Dina Boluarte. She became the country's first female president.[99][100] Castillo was arrested after trying to flee to the Mexican embassy and was charged with the crime of rebellion.[101]\n\n\nThe Boluarte government proved unpopular as she allied herself with the right-wing Congress and the military, betraying her constituents.[14][102] This resentment led to the 2022–2023 Peruvian political protests, which sought the removal of Boluarte and Congress, immediate general elections and the writing of a new constitution. Authorities responded to the protests violently, with the Ayacucho massacre and Juliaca massacre occurring at this time, resulting with the most violence experienced in the nation in over two decades.[14] The strong response by the political elite in Lima raised concerns that they sought to establish an authoritarian or civilian-military government.[14][102][103]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Peru and Politics of Peru\n\nPeru is a unitary semi-presidential republic with a multi-party system.[2][3] The country has maintained a liberal democratic system under its 1993 Constitution, which replaced a constitution that leaned the government to a federation to authorize more power to the president.[104][105] It is also a unitary republic, in which the central government holds the most power and can create administrative divisions. The Peruvian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United States (a written constitution, an autonomous Supreme court, and a presidential system) and the People's Republic of China (a unicameral congress, a premier and ministry system).[106]\n\n\nThe Peruvian government is separated into three branches:\n\n\n\n* Legislature: the unicameral Congress of Peru, consisting of 130 members of Congress (on a basis of population), the president of Congress, and the Permanent Commission;[107]\n* Executive: the president, the Council of Ministers, which in practice controls domestic legislation and serve as a Cabinet to the president, consisting of the prime minister and 18 ministers of the state;\n* Judiciary: the Supreme Court of Peru, also known as the Royal Audencia of Lima, composed of 18 justices including a supreme justice, along with 28 superior courts, 195 trial courts, and 1,838 district courts.\n\n\n![](image)Palacio de Gobierno, in Lima\nUnder its constitution, the president of Peru is both head of state and government and is elected to a five-year term without immediate reelection.[108] The president appoints ministers who oversee the 18 ministries of the state, including the prime minister, into the Cabinet.[109] The constitution designates minimal authority to the prime minister, who presides over cabinet meetings in which ministers advise the president and acts as a spokesperson on behalf of the executive branch.[110] The president is also able to pose questions of confidence to the Congress of Peru, and consequently order the dissolution of congress, done in 1992 by Alberto Fujimori and in 2019 by Martín Vizcarra.[111]\n\n\n\nIn the Congress of Peru, there are 130 Members of Congress from 25 administrative divisions, determined by respective population, elected to five-year terms.[112] Bills are proposed by the executive and legislative powers and become law through a plurality vote in Congress.[113] The judiciary is nominally independent,[114] though political intervention into judicial matters has been common throughout history.[115] The Congress of Peru can also pass a motion of no confidence, censure ministers, as well as initiate impeachments and convict executives.[116][117] Due to broadly interpreted impeachment wording in the 1993 Constitution of Peru, the legislative branch can impeach the president without cause, effectively making the executive branch subject to Congress.[87][88][89][90] In recent times, the legislative body has passed semi-successful impeachment and two successful impeachments; Alberto Fujimori resigned prior to removal in 2000, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in 2018, Martín Vizcarra was removed from office in 2020 and Pedro Castillo was removed in 2022.[118] Following a ruling in February 2023 by the Constitutional Court of Peru, whose members are elected by Congress, judicial oversight of the legislative body was also removed by the court, essentially giving Congress absolute control of Peru's government.[119][120] \n\n![](image)The Congress of Peru, in Lima\nPeru's electoral system uses compulsory voting for citizens from the age of 18 to 70, including dual-citizens and Peruvians abroad.[121] Members of Congress are directly elected by constituents in respective districts through proportional voting. The president is elected in a general election, along with the vice president, through a majority in a two-round system.[122] Elections are observed and organized by the National Jury of Elections, National Office of Electoral Processes, and the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status.[123]\n\n\nPeru uses a multi-party system for congressional and general elections. Major groups that have formed governments, both on a federal and legislative level, are parties that have historically adopted economic liberalism, progressivism, right-wing populism (specifically Fujimorism), nationalism, and reformism.[124]\n\n\nThe most recent general election was held on 11 April 2021 and resulted in Free Peru winning the most seats in Congress, although it fell well short of a majority.[125] A presidential runoff between Pedro Castillo and Keiko Fujimori took place on 5 June 2021 and resulted in the victory of Castillo.[126]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of corruption in politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Corruption in Peru\n\nExceptionally many presidents of Peru have been ousted from office or imprisoned on allegations of corruption from the 1990s into the 21st century. Alberto Fujimori is serving a 25-year sentence in prison for commanding death squads that killed civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his tenure (1990–2000). He was later also found guilty of corruption. Former president Alan García (1985–1990 and 2006–2011) killed himself in April 2019 when Peruvian police arrived to arrest him over allegations he participated in Odebrecht bribery scheme. Former president Alejandro Toledo is accused of allegedly receiving bribe from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht during his government (2001–2006). Former president Ollanta Humala (2011–2016) is also under investigation for allegedly receiving bribe from Odebrecht during his presidential election campaign. Humala's successor Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016–2018) remains under house arrest while prosecutors investigate him for favoring contracts with Odebrecht. Former president Martín Vizcarra (2018–2020) was controversially ousted by Congress after media reports alleged he had received bribes while he was a regional governor years earlier.[127][128]\n\n\nCorruption is also widespread throughout Congress as legislators use their office for parliamentary immunity and other benefits,[129] with the large majority of Peruvians disapproving of Congress and its behavior.[130]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Peru\n\n![](image)A map of Peru's region and departments\nPeru is divided into 26 units: 24 departments, the Constitutional Province of Callao and the Province of Lima (LIM) – which is independent of any region and serves as the country's capital.[131] Under the constitution, the 24 departments plus Callao Province have an elected \"regional\"[d] government composed of the regional governor and the regional council.[132][133]\n\n\nThe governor constitutes the executive body, proposes budgets, and creates decrees, resolutions, and regional programs.[134] The Regional Council, the region's legislative body, debates and votes on budgets, supervises regional officials, and can vote to remove the governor, deputy governor, or any member of the council from office. The regional governor and the Regional Council serve a term of four years, without immediate reelection. These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property.[135][136]\n\n\nProvinces, such as the province of Lima, are administered by a municipal council, headed by a mayor.[137] The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation. NGOs played an important role in the decentralization process and still influence local politics.[138][139]\n\n\nSome areas of Peru are defined as metropolitan areas which overlap district areas. The largest of them, the Lima metropolitan area, is the seventh-largest metropolis in the Americas.\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Peru\n  \n\n\n\n![](image)The headquarters of the Andean Community is located in Lima.\nOver recent decades, Peru's foreign relations has historically been dominated by close ties with the United States and Asia,[140] particularly through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the World Trade Organization, the Pacific Alliance, Mercosur, and the Organization of American States (OAS).[141][142]\nPeru is an active member of several regional trade blocs and is one of the founding members of the Andean Community of Nations. It is also a member of international organizations such as the OAS and the United Nations.[143] Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, a celebrated Peruvian diplomat, served as United Nations Secretary General from 1981 to 1991.\n\n\nPeru has planned to be fully integrated into the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by 2021, attributing its economic success and efforts to strengthen institutions as meeting factors to be a part of the OECD.[144][145] Peru is a member of the World Trade Organization, and has pursued multiple major free trade agreements, most recently the Peru–United States Free Trade Agreement, the China–Peru Free Trade Agreement, the European Union Free Trade Agreement, free trade agreements with Japan, and many others.[146][147]\n\n\nPeru maintains an integrated relationship with other South American nations, and is a member of various South American intergovernmental agreements, more recently the Organization of American States, Mercosur, the Andean Community of Nations, the Pacific Alliance, and the APEC. Peru has historically experienced stressed relations with Chile, including the Peru v Chile international court resolution and the Chilean-Peruvian maritime dispute, but the two countries have agreed to work in improving relations.[148]\n\n\nAdditionally, Peru has participated in taking a leading role in addressing the crisis in Venezuela through the establishment of the Lima Group.[149]\n\n\n\n### Military and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peruvian Armed Forces\n\n![](image)Peruvian marines in the VRAEM in 2019\nPeru has the fourth largest military in Latin America. Peru's armed forces – the Armed Forces of Peru – comprise the Peruvian Navy (MGP), the Peruvian Army (EP), and the Peruvian Air Force (FAP), in total numbering 392,660 personnel (including 120,660 regulars and 272,000 reservists) as of 2020.[150] Their primary mission is to safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.[151]\n\n\nTheir functions are separated by branch:\n\n\n\n* The Peruvian Army is made up of the Chief of Staff, two Control Bodies, two Support Bodies, five Military Regions and six Command Rooms.\n* The Peruvian Air Force was officially created on 20 May 1929, with the name of Peruvian Aviation Corps. Its main function is to serve as the country's air defense. It also participates in social support campaigns for hard-to-reach populations, organizes air bridges during disasters, and participates in international peace missions. Its four major air bases are located in the cities of Piura, Callao, Arequipa and Iquitos.\n* The Peruvian Navy is in charge of the country's maritime, river, and lake defense. It is made up of 26,000 sailors. Personnel are divided into three levels: superior personnel, junior personnel and seafarers.\n\n\nThe military is governed by both the commander in chief, Ministry of Defense, and Joint Command of the Armed Forces (CCFFAA). The CCFFAA has subordinates to the Operational Commands and Special Commands, with which it carries out the military operations that are required for the defense and the fulfillment of the tasks that the executive power provides.[152] Conscription was abolished in 1999 and replaced by voluntary military service.[153] The National Police of Peru is often classified as a part of the armed forces. Although in fact it has a different organization and a wholly civil mission, its training and activities over more than two decades as an anti-terrorist force have produced markedly military characteristics, giving it the appearance of a virtual fourth military service with significant land, sea and air capabilities and approximately 140,000 personnel. The Peruvian armed forces report through the Ministry of Defense, while the National Police of Peru reports through the Ministry of Interior.[154][151]\n\n\nSince the end of the crisis in Peru in 2000, the federal government has significantly reduced annual spending in defense.[155] In the 2016–2017 budget, defense spending has constituted 1.1% of GDP ($2.3 billion), the second lowest spending relative to GDP in South America following Argentina.[156] More recently, the Armed Forces of Peru have been used in civil defense. In 2020, Peru used its military personnel and even reservists to enforce the strict quarantine measures placed during the COVID-19 pandemic.[157]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Peru\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManú National Park in the Amazon, the mountain peak Alpamayo and Paracas National Reserve\n\nPeru is located on the central western coast of South America facing the Pacific Ocean. It lies wholly in the Southern Hemisphere, its northernmost extreme reaching to 1.8 minutes of latitude or about 3.3 kilometres (2.1 mi) south of the equator, covers 1,285,216 km2 (496,225 sq mi) of western South America. It borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Andes mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean; they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically.[158]\n\n\nThe *costa* (coast), to the west, is a narrow, largely arid plain except for valleys created by seasonal rivers. The *sierra* (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the *Altiplano* plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the 6,768 m (22,205 ft) Huascarán.[159] The third region is the *selva* (jungle), a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the Amazon rainforest that extends east. Almost 60 percent of the country's area is located within this region.[160] The country has fifty-four hydrographic basins, fifty-two of which are small coastal basins that discharge their waters into the Pacific Ocean. The final two are the endorheic basin of Lake Titicaca, and the Amazon basin, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Both are delimited by the Andes mountain range. The Amazon basin is particularly noteworthy as it is the source of the Amazon River, which at 6872 km, is the longest river in the world, and covers 75% of Peruvian territory. Peru contains 4% of the planet's freshwater.\n\n\nMost Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three basins. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the Amazon River have a much larger flow, and are longer and less steep once they exit the *sierra*. Rivers that drain into Lake Titicaca are generally short and have a large flow.[161] Peru's longest rivers are the Ucayali, the Marañón, the Putumayo, the Yavarí, the Huallaga, the Urubamba, the Mantaro, and the Amazon.[162]\n\n\nThe largest lake in Peru, Lake Titicaca between Peru and Bolivia high in the Andes, is also the largest of South America.[163]\nThe largest reservoirs, all in the coastal region of Peru, are the Poechos, Tinajones, San Lorenzo, and El Fraile reservoirs.[164]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Peru\n\n![](image)Map of Köppen climate classification zones in Peru\nThe combination of tropical latitude, mountain ranges, topography variations, and two ocean currents (Humboldt and El Niño) gives Peru a large diversity of climates. The coastal region has moderate temperatures, low precipitation, and high humidity, except for its warmer, wetter northern reaches.[165] In the mountain region, rain is frequent in summer, and temperature and humidity diminish with altitude up to the frozen peaks of the Andes.[166] The Peruvian Amazon is characterized by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, except for its southernmost part, which has cold winters and seasonal rainfall.[167]\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Peru\n\n![](image)Andean cock-of-the-rock, Peru's national bird\nBecause of its varied geography and climate, Peru has a high biodiversity with 21,462 species of plants and animals reported as of 2003, 5,855 of them endemic,[168] and is one of the megadiverse countries.\n\n\nPeru has over 1,800 species of birds (120 endemic), over 500 species of mammals, over 300 species of reptiles, and over 1,000 species of freshwater fishes.[169][170] The hundreds of mammals include rare species like the puma, jaguar and spectacled bear. The Birds of Peru produce large amounts of guano, an economically important export. The Pacific holds large quantities of sea bass, flounder, anchovies, tuna, crustaceans, and shellfish, and is home to many sharks, sperm whales, and whales.[171] The invertebrate fauna is far less inventoried; at least beetles (Coleoptera) have been surveyed in the \"Beetles of Peru\" project, led by Caroline S. Chaboo, University of Nebraska, USA and this revealved more 12,000 documented and many new species for Peru.[172]\n\n\nPeru also has an equally diverse flora. The coastal deserts produce little more than cacti, apart from hilly fog oases and river valleys that contain unique plant life.[173]\nThe Highlands above the tree-line known as puna is home to bushes, cactus, drought-resistant plants such as ichu, and the largest species of bromeliad – the spectacular Puya raimondii.\n\n\nThe cloud-forest slopes of the Andes sustain moss, orchids, and bromeliads, and the Amazon rainforest is known for its variety of trees and canopy plants.[171] Peru had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.86/10, ranking it 14th globally out of 172 countries.[174]\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Peru\n\nThe economy of Peru is the 48th largest in the world (ranked by Purchasing power parity),[175] and the income level is classified as *upper middle* by the World Bank.[176] Peru is, as of 2011[update], one of the world's fastest-growing economies owing to an economic boom experienced during the 2000s.[177] It has an above-average Human Development Index of 0.77 which has seen steady improvement over the last 25 years.[*clarify*][178] Historically, the country's economic performance has been tied to exports, which provide hard currency to finance imports and external debt payments.[179] Although they have provided substantial revenue, self-sustained growth and a more egalitarian distribution of income have proven elusive.[180] According to 2015 data, 19.3% of its total population is poor, including 9% that lives in extreme poverty.[181] Inflation in 2012 was the lowest in Latin America at only 1.8%, but increased in 2013 as oil and commodity prices rose; as of 2014[update] it stands at 2.5%.[182] and 8,6 in 2023.[183] The unemployment rate has fallen steadily in recent years,[*clarify*] and as of 2012[update] stands at 3.6%.\n\n\nPeruvian economic policy has varied widely over the past decades.[*clarify*] The 1968–1975 government of Juan Velasco Alvarado introduced radical reforms, which included agrarian reform, the expropriation of foreign companies, the introduction of an economic planning system, and the creation of a large state-owned sector. These measures failed to achieve their objectives of income redistribution and the end of economic dependence on developed nations.[184]\n\n\nDespite these results, most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s, when the liberalizing government of Alberto Fujimori ended price controls, protectionism, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and most state ownership of companies.[185]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update] Services account for 53% of Peruvian gross domestic product, followed by manufacturing (22.3%), extractive industries (15%), and taxes (9.7%).[186] Recent economic growth had been fueled by macroeconomic stability, improved terms of trade, and rising investment and consumption.[187] Trade was expected to increase further after the implementation of a free trade agreement with the United States signed on 12 April 2006.[188] Peru's main exports were copper, gold, zinc, textiles, and fish meal; its major trade partners were the United States, China, Brazil, and Chile.[189] Peru was ranked 76th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[190]\n\n\nInformal workers represent, in 2019, 70% of the labour market according to the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI). In 2016, almost three million children and adolescents worked in the informal sector.[191]\n\n\n\n### Mining[edit]\n\n\nThe country is heavily dependent on mining for the export of raw materials, which represent 60% of exports: in 2019, the country was the second world producer of copper,[192] silver[193] and zinc,[194] eighth world producer of gold,[195] third world producer of lead,[196] the world's fourth largest producer of tin,[197] the fifth world's largest producer of boron[198] and the world's fourth largest producer of molybdenum.[199] – not to mention gas and of oil. Little industrialized, Peru suffers from the international variation of commodity prices.[200]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nPeru is the world's largest producer of quinoa, one of the 5 largest producers of avocado, blueberry, artichoke and asparagus, one of the 10 largest producers in the world of coffee and cocoa, and one of the 15 largest producers in the world of potato and pineapple, also having a considerable production of grape, sugarcane, rice, banana, maize and cassava; its agriculture is considerably diversified. In livestock, Peru is one of the 20 largest producers of chicken meat in the world.[201]\n\n\nAccording to a report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) published in August 2022, half of Peru's population is moderately food insecure (16.6 million people), and more than 20% (6.8 million people), are severely food insecure: they go without food for a whole day, or even several days.[202][203]\n\n\nThe director of FAO Peru stresses that \"this is the great paradox of a country that has enough food for its population. Peru is a net producer of food and one of the major agro-exporting powers in the region. Food insecurity is due to high social inequality and low wages, with Peru's minimum wage being one of the lowest in South America and a large informal sector. According to the FAO, the small farmers themselves suffer from hunger. Poorly paid, they also suffer from the impacts of climate change and face the problem of drug trafficking on their land and mining activity that exhausts the soil.\"[202][203]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nThe World Bank lists the top producing countries each year, based on the total value of production. By the 2019 list, Peru has the 50th most valuable industry in the world ($28.7 billion).[204]\n\n\nIn 2016 Peru was the world's largest supplier of fishmeal.[205]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jorge Chávez International Airport, in Callao\nPeru's road network in 2021 consisted of 175,589 km (109,106 mi) of highways, with 29,579 km (18,380 mi) paved.[206] Some highways in the country that stand out are the Pan American Highway and Interoceanic Highway. In 2016, the country had 827 km (514 mi) of duplicated highways, and was investing in more duplications: the plan was to have 2,634 km (1,637 mi) in 2026.[207] The country's rail network is small: in 2018, the country only had 1,939 km (1,205 mi) of railways.[208]\n\n\nPeru has important international airports such as Lima, Cuzco and Arequipa. The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina) and Minas Gerais (Brazil).[209]\n\n\nPeru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 most active ports in South America in 2018 were: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[210]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nPeruvian electricity production totalled 5.1 TWh in the month of October 2022. Of these, 52% came from hydroelectric plants, 38.3% from thermoelectric plants (which use oil, gas and coal) and 9.7% of renewable energy plants like: wind, solar, and others.[211]\n\n\nIn 2021, Peru had, in terms of installed renewable electricity, 5,490 MW in hydropower (34th largest in the world), 409 MW in wind power (49th largest in the world), 336 MW in solar power (62nd largest in the world), and 185 MW in biomass.[212]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Health in Peru § Healthcare system.[edit]\nPeru has a decentralized healthcare system that consists of a combination of governmental and non-governmental coverage. Health care is covered by the Ministry of Health, EsSalud, the Armed Forces (FFAA), and National Police (PNP), as well as private insurance companies. The Ministry of Health insures 60% of the population and EsSalud covers another 30%. The remaining population in Peru is insured by a combination of the FFAA, PNP, and private insurance companies.[213]\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Peru and Peruvian people\n\n![](image)Population age pyramid of Peru in 2020.\nWith about 31.2 million inhabitants in 2017, Peru is the fourth most populous country in South America.[214] The demographic growth rate of Peru declined from 2.6% to 1.6% between 1950 and 2000; with the population being expected to reach approximately 42 million in 2050.[215] According to the 1940 Peruvian census, Peru had a population at the time of seven million residents.[216]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], 79.3% lived in urban areas and 20.7% in rural areas.[217] Major cities include the Lima metropolitan area (home to over 9.8 million people), Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, Iquitos, Cusco, Chimbote, and Huancayo; all reported more than 250,000 inhabitants in the 2007 census.[218] There are 15 uncontacted Amerindian tribes in Peru.[219] Peru has a life expectancy of 75.0 years (72.4 for males and 77.7 for females) according to the latest data for the year 2016 from the World Bank.[220]\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in PeruEstimated 2014\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Lima](image)Lima![Arequipa](image)Arequipa | 1 | Lima | Lima | 9,735,587 (Metro pop.)

Amerindians inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before the Spanish conquest in the 16th century; according to historian Noble David Cook, their population decreased from nearly 5–9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of infectious diseases.[223]\n\n\nThe 2017 census for the first time included a question on ethnic self-identification. According to the results, 60.2% of the people identified themselves as mestizo, 22.3% identified themselves as Quechua, 5.9% identified themselves as white, 3.6% identified themselves as black, 2.4% identified themselves as Aymara, 2.3% identified themselves as other ethnic groups, and 3.3% did not declare their ethnicity.[222]\n\n\nSpaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with Indigenous peoples. After independence, there was gradual immigration from England, France, Germany, and Italy.[224] Peru freed its black slaves in 1854.[225] Chinese and Japanese arrived in the 1850s as laborers following the end of slavery, and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society.[226]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Peru\n\n![](image)Casa de Osambela, headquarters of the Academia Peruana de la Lengua (APL) in Lima\nAccording to the Peruvian Constitution of 1993, Peru's official languages are Spanish and, in areas where they predominate, Quechua and other Indigenous languages. Spanish is spoken natively by 82.6% of the population, Quechua by 13.9%, and Aymara by 1.7%, while other languages are spoken by the remaining 1.8%.[227]\n\n\nSpanish language is used by the government and is the mainstream language of the country, which is used by the media and in educational systems and commerce. Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and Aymara and are ethnically distinct from the diverse Indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the Amazon basin.[228]\n\n\nPeru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a language divide between the coast where Spanish is more predominant over the Amerindian languages, and the more diverse traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The Indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional Indigenous languages, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the Spanish language. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken. In the Peruvian Amazon, numerous Indigenous languages are spoken, including Asháninka, Bora, and Aguaruna.[228]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Peru\n\n![](image)Quri Kancha and the Convent of Santo Domingo, in Cusco\nRoman Catholicism has been the predominant faith in Peru for centuries, albeit religious practices have a high degree of syncretism with Indigenous traditions.[*citation needed*] Two of its universities, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and Universidad Cattolica San Pablo, are among the 5 top universities of the country.[229] As of the 2017 census, 76% of the population over 12 years old described themselves as Catholic, 14.1% as Evangelical, 4.8% as Protestant, Jewish, Latter-day Saints, and Jehovah's Witnesses, and 5.1% as nonreligious.[230]\n\n\nAmerindian religious traditions continue to play a major role in the beliefs of Peruvians. Catholic festivities like Corpus Christi, Holy Week and Christmas sometimes blend with Amerindian traditions. Amerindian festivities from pre-Columbian remain widespread; Inti Raymi, an ancient Inca festival, is still celebrated, especially in rural communities.\n\n\nThe majority of towns, cities, and villages have their own official church or cathedral and patron saint.\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Peru\n\n![](image)National University of San Marcos, in Lima\nPeru's literacy rate is estimated at 92.9% as of 2007; this rate is lower in rural areas (80.3%) than in urban areas (96.3%).[231] Primary and secondary education are compulsory and free in public schools.[175][232]\n\n\nPeru is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The National University of San Marcos, founded on 12 May 1551, during the Viceroyalty of Peru, is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Toponyms[edit]\n\n\nMany of the Peruvian toponyms have Indigenous sources. In the Andes communities of Ancash, Cusco and Puno, Quechua or Aymara names are overwhelmingly predominant. Their Spanish-based orthography, however, is in conflict with the normalized alphabets of these languages. According to Article 20 of *Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC* (Supreme Decree) which approves the Regulations to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper El Peruano on 22 July 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalized alphabets of the Indigenous languages must progressively be proposed with the aim of standardizing the naming used by the National Geographic Institute *(Instituto Geográfico Nacional, IGN)*. The National Geographic Institute realizes the necessary changes in the official maps of Peru.[233]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Peru\n\n![](image)Textile doll (11th century), Chancay culture, Walters Art Museum. Dolls, of reduced size, are frequently found in the tombs of ancient Peru.[234]\nPeruvian culture is primarily rooted in Iberian and Andean traditions,[235] though it has also been influenced by various European, Asian, and African ethnic groups. Peruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu. Baroque dominated colonial art, though modified by Native traditions.[236]\n\n\nDuring this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cusco School are representative.[237] Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of *Indigenismo* in the early 20th century.[238] Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been eclectic and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.\n\n\n\n### Visual Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peruvian art\n\nPeruvian art has its origin in the Andean civilizations. These civilizations arose in the territory of modern Peru before the arrival of the Spanish. Peruvian art incorporated European elements after the Spanish conquest and continued to evolve throughout the centuries up to the modern day.\n\n\n\n#### Pre-Columbian art[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Moche *Nariguera* depicting the Decapitator, gold with turquoise and chrysocolla inlays. Museo del Oro del Peru, Lima.\nPeru's earliest artwork came from the Cupisnique culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chavín culture, which was largely north of Lima between the Andean mountain ranges of the Cordillera Negra and the Cordillera Blanca. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver, and ceramics to create a variety of sculptures and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their architecture and wood sculptures.\n\n\nBetween the 9th century BCE and the 2nd century CE, the Paracas Cavernas and Paracas Necropolis cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded complex textiles, many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns.\n\n\nThe 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, Moche, in the Lambayeque region. The Moche culture produced architectural works, such as the Huacas del Sol y de la Luna and the Huaca Rajada of Sipán. They were experts at cultivation in terraces and hydraulic engineering and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works.\n\n\n\n![](image)Huaca de la Luna, Moche temple that has preserved courtyards and ceremonial plazas of more than 1,500 years old. Located in the city of Trujillo.\nAnother urban culture, the Wari civilization, flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in Ayacucho. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as Pachacamac, Cajamarquilla and Wari Willka.\n\n\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban Tiwanaku empire rose by the borders of Lake Titicaca. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of architecture and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing bronze, which enabled them to make the necessary tools.\n\n\nUrban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the Chimú Culture. The Chimú built the city of Chan Chan in the valley of the Moche River, in La Libertad. The Chimú were skilled goldsmiths and created remarkable works of hydraulic engineering.\n\n\nThe Inca Civilization, which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like Cusco, architectural remains like Sacsahuamán and Machu Picchu and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.\n\n\n\n#### Colonial art[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Peruvian colonial architecture and Cusco School\n\n![](image)*Saint Joseph and the Christ Child*, Anonymous, Colonial Cusco Painting School, 17th–18th century\nPeruvian sculpture and painting began to define themselves from the ateliers founded by monks, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the Cathedral choir, the fountain of the Main Square of Lima both by Pedro de Noguera, and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the Cuzco School that taught Quechua artists European painting styles. Diego Quispe Tito (1611–1681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and Marcos Zapata (1710–1773) was one of the last.[239]\n\n\nPainting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and Indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians Mateo Pérez de Alesio and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J. Rodriguez.\n\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baroque Style also dominated the field of plastic arts.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peruvian literature\n\nThe term Peruvian literature not only refers to literature produced in the independent Republic of Peru, but also to literature produced in the Viceroyalty of Peru during the country's colonial period, and to oral artistic forms created by diverse ethnic groups that existed in the area during the pre-Columbian period, such as the Quechua, the Aymara and the Chanka people.\n\n\nPeruvian literature is rooted in the oral traditions of pre-Columbian civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included chronicles and religious literature. After independence, Costumbrism and Romanticism became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of Ricardo Palma.[240] The early 20th century's *Indigenismo* movement was led by such writers as Ciro Alegría[241] and José María Arguedas.[242] César Vallejo wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse. Modern Peruvian literature is recognized thanks to authors such as Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom.[243]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peruvian cuisine\n\n![](image)*Ceviche* is a popular lime-marinated seafood dish which originated in Peru.\nBecause of the Spanish expedition and discovery of America, explorers started the Columbian exchange which included unknown food in the Old World, including potatoes, tomatoes, and maize. Modern Indigenous Peruvian food often includes corn, potatoes, and chilies. There are now more than 3,000 kinds of potatoes grown on Peruvian terrain, according to Peru's Instituto Peruano de la Papa.[244]\nModern Peruvian cuisine blends Amerindian and Spanish food with strong influences from Chinese, African, Arab, Italian, and Japanese cooking.[245] Common dishes include *anticuchos*, *ceviche*, and *pachamanca*. Peru's varied climate allows the growth of diverse plants and animals good for cooking.[246]\n\n\nPeruvian cuisine reflects local practices and ingredients – including influences from the Indigenous population including the Inca and cuisines brought in with colonizers and immigrants. Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, potatoes and other tubers, Amaranthaceaes (quinoa, kañiwa and kiwicha) and legumes (beans and lupins). Staples brought by the Spanish include rice, wheat, and meats (beef, pork, and chicken). Many traditional foods – such as quinoa, kiwicha, chili peppers, and several roots and tubers have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in Native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. It is also common to see traditional cuisines being served with a modern flair in towns like Cusco, where tourists come to visit. Chef Gastón Acurio has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peruvian music\n\n![](image)Marinera Norteña\nPeruvian music has Andean, Spanish, and African roots.[247] In pre-Columbian times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the *quena* and the *tinya* were two common instruments.[248] Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the *charango*.[249] African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the *cajón*, a percussion instrument. Peruvian folk dances include marinera, tondero, zamacueca, diablada and huayno.[250]\n\n\nPeruvian music is dominated by the national instrument, the charango. The charango is a member of the lute family of instruments and was invented during colonial times by musicians imitating the Spanish vihuela. In the Canas and Titicaca regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking mermaids with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built the Indigenismo movement (1910–1940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the walaycho, chillador, chinlili, and the larger and lower-tuned charangon.\n\n\nWhile the Spanish guitar is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin bandurria. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere four courses. Violins and harps, also of European origin, are also played.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nWhile the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru began in Iquitos in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial film billboard from 1900) because of the rubber boom and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima.\n\n\nPeru also produced the first animated 3-D film in Latin America, *Piratas en el Callao*. This film is set in the historical port city of Callao, which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the Peruvian company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: *Dragones: Destino de Fuego*.\n\n\nIn February 2006, the film *Madeinusa*, produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by Claudia Llosa, was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by Magaly Solier and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.\n\n\nLlosa, who shared elements of Gabriel García Márquez's magic realism, won an award at the Rotterdam Film Festival. Llosa's second feature, The Milk of Sorrow (\"La Teta Asustada\"), was nominated for the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the academy's history to be nominated. The Milk of Sorrow (\"La Teta Asustada\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Peru portal\n\n\n* Outline of Peru\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Peru, other languages have been officially recognized as legitimate autochthonous languages.\n\n\t* Quechua: *Piruw Ripuwlika*\n\t* Aymara: *Piruwxa Ripuwlika*\n2. **^** The 2017 National Census included, for the first time, a question of ethnic self-identification that was addressed to people aged 12 and over considering elements such as their ancestry, their customs and their family origin to visualize and better understand the cultural reality of the country.\n3. **^**  The question about religion included in the 2017 National Census was addressed to people aged 12 and over.\n4. **^** The government in each department is referred to as \"regional\" governments despite being departments.\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico\" (PDF). *Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática*. p. 231.

Some 56 intact storage jars were discovered. Investigations revealed that they had come from kilns in South China, Cochin China (Vietnam), and Siam (Thailand), and one was of Spanish design. The archaeology of the Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, consequently, also provides us with intriguing new insights into the trans-Pacific trade connection and the commodities involved. Each time a galleon arrived at Acapulco, a market, la feria, was organized. This attracted all kinds of people such as Indian peddlers, Mexican and Peruvian merchants, soldiers, the king's officials, and friars, as well as a few Chinese and some Filipinos. From Acapulco, the goods were transported into the hinterlands, into Mexico City, and various other places, including Peru. The Peruvian port at that time was Callao and the Ciudad de los Reyes, that is Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Generally speaking, much of what was not sold (rezagos) directly in Acapulco was redirected towards Peru. Peruvian ships, mainly loaded with silver, mercury, cacao from Guayaquil, and Peruvian wines, sailed to ports along the Mexican and Guatemalan coasts, returning with Asian goods and leftover cargo from the galleon ships. Besides Callao and Guayaquil, Paita was also frequently a port of call.\n43. **^** \"Second book of the second part of the Conquests of the Filipinas Islands, and chronicle of the religious of our Father, St. Augustine\". *Zamboanga City History*.

It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world and the third-most populous country in the Americas after the United States and Brazil.[5] Throughout most of the 20th century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress; Mexico still has a large youth cohort. The most populous city in the country is the capital, Mexico City, with a population of 8.9 million (2016), and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1 million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, and only about 21.16% in rural ones.\n\n\nDemographic censuses are performed by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informatica. The National Population Council (CONAPO) is an institution under the Ministry of Interior in charge of the analysis and research of population dynamics. The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI), also undertakes research and analysis of the sociodemographic and linguistic indicators of the indigenous peoples.\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic dynamics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mexicans\n\n![](image)*Mestiza* woman clad in indigenous clothes\n![](image)Historical population of Mexico\n![](image)Population growth\n![](image)Mexican states by population density\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1865  | 8,259,080[6] | —     |\n| 1895  | 12,700,294 | +1.44% |\n| 1900  | 13,607,272 | +1.39% |\n| 1910  | 15,160,369 | +1.09% |\n| 1921  | 14,334,780 | −0.51% |\n| 1930  | 16,552,722 | +1.61% |\n| 1940  | 19,653,552 | +1.73% |\n| 1950  | 25,791,017 | +2.75% |\n| 1960  | 34,923,129 | +3.08% |\n| 1970  | 48,225,238 | +3.28% |\n| 1980  | 66,846,833 | +3.32% |\n| 1990  | 81,249,645 | +1.97% |\n| 2000  | 97,483,412 | +1.84% |\n| 2010  | 112,336,538 | +1.43% |\n| 2020  | 126,014,024 | +1.16% |\n| Source: INEGI |\n\n\nIn 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.[7] During the period of economic prosperity that was dubbed by economists as the \"Mexican Miracle\", the government invested in efficient social programs that reduced the infant mortality rate and increased life expectancy. These measures jointly led to an intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980. The population's annual growth rate has been reduced from a 3.5% peak in 1965 to 0.99% in 2005. While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of demographic transition, close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger.[8] Fertility rates have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006.[9] After decades of the gap narrowing, in 2020 the fertility rate in Mexico fell below the United States for the first time falling 22% in 2020 and a further 10.5% in the first half of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nThe average annual population growth rate of Mexico City was 0.2%. The state with the lowest population growth rate over the same period was Michoacán (-0.1%), whereas the states with the highest population growth rates were Quintana Roo (4.7%) and Baja California Sur (3.4%),[11] both of which are two of the least populous states and the last to be admitted to the Union in the 1970s. The average annual net migration rate of Mexico City over the same period was negative and the lowest of all political divisions of Mexico, whereas the states with the highest net migration rate were Quintana Roo (2.7), Baja California (1.8) and Baja California Sur (1.6).[12] While the national annual growth rate was still positive (1.0%) in the early years of the 2000s, the national net migration rate was negative (-4.75/1000 inhabitants), given the former strong flow of immigrants to the United States; an estimated 5.3 million undocumented Mexican immigrants lived in the United States in 2004[13] and 18.2 million American citizens in the 2000 Census declared having Mexican ancestry.[14] However, as of recent years in the 2010s, the net migration rate reached 0, given the strong economy of Mexico, changes in US Immigration Policy & Enforcement, US Legislative and CFR-8 decisions, plus the (then) slowly recovering US economy, causing many of its former residents to return. The Mexican government projects[15] that the Mexican population will grow to about 123 million by 2042 and then start declining slowly. Assumptions underlying this projection include fertility stabilizing at 1.85 children per woman and continued high net emigration (slowly decreasing from 583,000 in 2005 to 393,000 in 2050).\n\n\nThe states and Mexico City that make up the Mexican federation are collectively called \"federal entities\". The five most populous federal entities in 2005 were the State of Mexico (14.4 million), Mexico City (8.7 million), Veracruz (7.1 million), Jalisco (6.7 million) and Puebla (5.4 million), which collectively contain 40.7% of the national population. Mexico City, being coextensive with the Mexico City, is the most populous city in the country, while Greater Mexico City, that includes the adjacent municipalities that comprise a metropolitan area, is estimated to be the second most populous in the world (after Tokyo), according to the UN Urbanization Report.\n\n\nIntense population growth in the northern states, especially along the US-Mexican border, changed the country's demographic profile in the second half of the 20th century, as the 1967 US-Mexico maquiladora agreement through which all products manufactured in the border cities could be imported duty-free to the US. Since the adoption of NAFTA in 1994, however, which allows all products to be imported duty-free regardless of their place of origin within Mexico, the non-border maquiladora share of exports has increased while that of border cities has decreased,.[16] This has led to decentralization and rapid economic growth in Mexican states (and cities), such as Quintana Roo (Cancun), Baja California Sur (La Paz), Nuevo León (Monterrey), Querétaro, and Aguascalientes. The population of each of these five states grew by more than one-third from 2000 to 2015, while the whole of Mexico grew by 22.6% in this period.\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexico's population pyramid (2017)\nAccording to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects, the total population was 117,886,000 in 2010, compared to only 28,296,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 30%, 64% of the population was between 15 and 65 years of age, and 6% was 65 years or older.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Total population (x 1000)\n | Proportionaged 0–14(%)\n | Proportionaged 15–64(%)\n | Proportionaged 65+(%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\n | 28 296 | 42.5 | 54.1 | 3.5\n |\n| 1955\n | 33 401 | 44.5 | 52.2 | 3.3\n |\n| 1960\n | 38 677 | 45.9 | 50.8 | 3.4\n |\n| 1965\n | 45 339 | 46.8 | 49.6 | 3.5\n |\n| 1970\n | 52 988 | 46.6 | 49.7 | 3.7\n |\n| 1975\n | 61 708 | 46.2 | 50.1 | 3.7\n |\n| 1980\n | 70 353 | 44.7 | 51.5 | 3.8\n |\n| 1985\n | 77 859 | 42.1 | 53.9 | 3.9\n |\n| 1990\n | 86 077 | 38.5 | 57.2 | 4.3\n |\n| 1995\n | 95 393 | 35.9 | 59.6 | 4.5\n |\n| 2000\n | 103 874 | 34.1 | 61.0 | 4.9\n |\n| 2005\n | 110 732 | 32.3 | 62.4 | 5.3\n |\n| 2010\n | 117 886 | 30.0 | 64.0 | 6.0\n |\n| 2015\n | 127 017 | 27.6 | 65.9 | 6.5\n |\n| 2020\n | 134 837 | 25.6 | 66.9 | 7.6\n |\n\n\n### Structure of the population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 12.VI.2010) (Including an estimation of 1 334 585 persons corresponding to 448 195 housing units without information of the occupants.):[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 54 855 231\n | 57 481 307\n | 112 336 538\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 5 346 943\n | 5 181 379\n | 10 528 322\n | 9.37\n |\n| 5–9\n | 5 604 175\n | 5 443 362\n | 11 047 537\n | 9.83\n |\n| 10–14\n | 5 547 613\n | 5 392 324\n | 10 939 937\n | 9.74\n |\n| 15–19\n | 5 520 121\n | 5 505 991\n | 11 026 112\n | 9.82\n |\n| 20–24\n | 4 813 204\n | 5 079 067\n | 9 892 271\n | 8.81\n |\n| 25–29\n | 4 205 975\n | 4 582 202\n | 8 788 177\n | 7.82\n |\n| 30–34\n | 4 026 031\n | 4 444 767\n | 8 470 798\n | 7.54\n |\n| 35–39\n | 3 964 738\n | 4 328 249\n | 8 292 987\n | 7.38\n |\n| 40–44\n | 3 350 322\n | 3 658 904\n | 7 009 226\n | 6.24\n |\n| 45–49\n | 2 824 364\n | 3 104 366\n | 5 928 730\n | 5.28\n |\n| 50–54\n | 2 402 451\n | 2 661 840\n | 5 064 291\n | 4.51\n |\n| 55–59\n | 1 869 537\n | 2 025 828\n | 3 895 365\n | 3.47\n |\n| 60–64\n | 1 476 667\n | 1 639 799\n | 3 116 466\n | 2.77\n |\n| 65–69\n | 1 095 273\n | 1 221 992\n | 2 317 265\n | 2.06\n |\n| 70–74\n | 873 893\n | 1 000 041\n | 1 873 934\n | 1.67\n |\n| 75–79\n | 579 689\n | 665 794\n | 1 245 483\n | 1.11\n |\n| 80–84\n | 355 277\n | 443 659\n | 798 936\n | 0.71\n |\n| 85–89\n | 197 461\n | 256 703\n | 454 164\n | 0.40\n |\n| 90–94\n | 68 130\n | 96 794\n | 164 924\n | 0.15\n |\n| 95–99\n | 25 920\n | 39 812\n | 65 732\n | 0.06\n |\n| 100+\n | 7 228\n | 11 247\n | 18 475\n | 0.02\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 16 498 731\n | 16 017 065\n | 32 515 796\n | 28.94\n |\n| 15–64\n | 34 453 410\n | 37 031 013\n | 71 484 423\n | 63.63\n |\n| 65+\n | 3 202 871\n | 3 736 042\n | 6 938 913\n | 6.18\n |\n| unknown\n | 700 219\n | 697 187\n | 1 397 406\n | 1.24\n |\n\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 15.III.2020) (Including an estimation of 6 337 751 persons corresponding to 1 588 422 housing units without information of the occupants.):[19]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 61 473 390\n | 64 540 634\n | 126 014 024\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 5 077 482\n | 4 969 883\n | 10 047 365\n | 7.97\n |\n| 5–9\n | 5 453 091\n | 5 311 288\n | 10 764 379\n | 8.54\n |\n| 10–14\n | 5 554 260\n | 5 389 280\n | 10 943 540\n | 8.68\n |\n| 15–19\n | 5 462 150\n | 5 344 540\n | 10 806 690\n | 8.57\n |\n| 20–24\n | 5 165 884\n | 5 256 211\n | 10 422 095\n | 8.27\n |\n| 25–29\n | 4 861 404\n | 5 131 597\n | 9 993 001\n | 7.93\n |\n| 30–34\n | 4 527 726\n | 4 893 101\n | 9 420 827\n | 7.47\n |\n| 35–39\n | 4 331 530\n | 4 668 746\n | 9 020 276\n | 7.15\n |\n| 40–44\n | 4 062 304\n | 4 441 282\n | 8 503 586\n | 6.74\n |\n| 45–49\n | 3 812 344\n | 4 130 069\n | 7 942 413\n | 6.30\n |\n| 50–54\n | 3 332 163\n | 3 705 360\n | 7 037 532\n | 5.58\n |\n| 55–59\n | 2 692 976\n | 3 002 982\n | 5 695 958\n | 4.52\n |\n| 60–64\n | 2 257 862\n | 2 563 200\n | 4 821 062\n | 3.82\n |\n| 65–69\n | 1 706 850\n | 1 938 227\n | 3 645 077\n | 2.89\n |\n| 70–74\n | 1 233 492\n | 1 413 848\n | 2 647 340\n | 2.10\n |\n| 75–79\n | 847 898\n | 966 684\n | 1 814 582\n | 1.43\n |\n| 80–84\n | 523 812\n | 651 552\n | 1 175 364\n | 0.93\n |\n| 85+\n | 433 968\n | 605 583\n | 1 039 551\n | 0.82\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 16 084 833\n | 15 670 451\n | 31 755 284\n | 25.20\n |\n| 15–64\n | 40 506 343\n | 43 157 097\n | 83 663 440\n | 66.39\n |\n| 65+\n | 4 746 020\n | 5 575 894\n | 10 321 914\n | 8.19\n |\n| unknown\n | 136 194\n | 137 192\n | 273 386\n | 0.22\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Non-Spanish immigrant groups included British, Irish, Italian, German, French and Dutch.[30] Large numbers of Middle Eastern immigrants arrived in Mexico during the same period, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.[31] Asian immigrants, mostly Chinese, some via the United States, settled in northern Mexico, whereas Koreans settled in central Mexico.[32]\n\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s Mexico opened its doors to immigrants from Latin America, mainly political refugees from Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Peru, Colombia and Central America. The PRI governments, in power for most of the 20th century, had a policy of granting asylum to fellow Latin Americans fleeing political persecution in their home countries. A second wave of immigrants has come to Mexico as a result of the economic crises experienced by some countries in the region. The Argentine community is quite significant estimated to be somewhere between 11,000 and 30,000.[33][34]\n\n\nDue to the 2008 Financial Crisis and the resulting economic decline and high unemployment in Spain, many Spaniards have been emigrating to Mexico to seek new opportunities.[35] For example, during the last quarter of 2012, a number of 7,630 work permits were granted to Spaniards.[36]\n\n\nMexico is also the country where the largest number of American citizens live abroad, with Mexico City playing host to the largest number of American citizens abroad in the world. The American Citizens Abroad Association estimated in 1999 that a little more than one million Americans live in Mexico (which represent 1% of the population in Mexico and 25% of all American citizens living abroad).[37] This immigration phenomenon could well be explained by the interaction of both countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but also by the fact that Mexico has become a popular destination for retirees, especially the small towns: just in the State of Guanajuato, in San Miguel de Allende and its surroundings, 10,000 Americans have their residence.[38]\n\n\nDiscrepancies between the figures of official legal aliens and all foreign-born residents is quite large. The official figure for foreign-born residents in Mexico in 2000 was 493,000,[39] with a majority (86.9%) of these born in the United States (except Chiapas, where the majority of immigrants are from Central America). The six states with the most immigrants are Baja California (12.1% of total immigrants), Mexico City (11.4%), Jalisco (9.9%), Chihuahua (9%) and Tamaulipas (7.3%).[39]\n\n\n\n### Emigration from Mexico[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trend of Mexican migration to the United States. Here the term immigrant refers to those who were not born in the U.S. but are now currently residing in the U.S. This can include naturalized U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, employees and students on visas, and the undocumented.[40]\nThe national net migration rate of Mexico is negative, estimated at -1.8 migrants per 1,000 population as of 2017[update].[41]\nThe great majority of Mexican emigrants have moved to the United States of America. This migration phenomenon is not new, but it has been a defining feature in the relationship of both countries for most of the 20th century.[42] During World Wars I and II, the United States government approved the recruitment of Mexican workers in their territory, and tolerated unauthorized migration to obtain additional farm- and industrial-workers to fill the necessary spots vacated by the population in war, and to supply the increase in the demand for labor. Nonetheless, the United States unilaterally ended the wartime programs – in part as a result of arguments from labor and from civil-rights groups.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The San Ysidro Port of Entry is the fourth busiest border checkpoint in the world. Most traffic is related to commerce or day workers, rather than immigration.\nIn spite of that, emigration of Mexicans continued throughout the rest of the 20th century at varying rates. It grew significantly during the 1990s and continued to do so in the first years of the 2000s. In fact, it has been estimated that 37% of all Mexican immigrants to the United States in the 20th century arrived during the 1990s.[42] In 2000 approximately 20 million American residents identified themselves as either Mexican, Mexican-Americans or of Mexican origin, making \"Mexican\" the sixth-most cited ancestry of all US residents.[44]\n\n\nIn 2000 the INEGI estimated that about eight million Mexican-born people, which then was equivalent to 8.7% of the population of Mexico itself, lived in the United States of America.[45] In that year, the Mexican states sending the greatest numbers of emigrants to the United States were Jalisco (170,793), Michoacán (165,502), and Guanajuato (163,338); the total number of Mexican emigrants to the United States in 2000, both legal and illegal, was estimated at 1,569,157; the great majority of these were men.[46] Approximately 30% of emigrants come from rural communities.[47] In 2000, 260,650 emigrants returned to Mexico.[48] According to the Pew Hispanic Center in 2006, an estimated ten percent of all Mexican citizens lived in the United States.[49] The population of Mexican immigrants residing illegally in the United States fell from around seven million in 2007 to about 6.1 million in 2011.[50] This trajectory has been linked[*by whom?*] to the economic downturn which started in 2008 and which reduced available jobs, and to the introduction of stricter immigration laws in many States.[51][52][53][54] According to the Pew Hispanic Center the total number of Mexican-born people had stagnated in 2010 and then began to fall.[55]\n\n\nAfter the Mexican-American community, Mexican Canadians are the second-largest group of emigrant Mexicans, with a population of over 50,000.[56] A significant but unknown number of mestizos of Mexican descent migrated to the Philippines during the era of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, when the Philippines was a territory under the rule of Mexico city.[57] Mexicans live throughout Latin America as well as in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Emigration list from Mexico[58]Mexican residents in the world by countries\n |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Population\n | Position\n | Continent\n |\n| ![](image) United States | 36,300,000[59] | 1 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 90,585[60] | 2 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 56,757[61] | 3 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Guatemala | 14,481[62] | 4 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia | 13,377[63] | 5 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 8,848[64] | 6 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 6,750[65] | 7 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,125[66] | 8 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 4,872[67] | 9 | Oceania\n |\n| ![](image) France | 4,601[68] | 10 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Israel | 4,252[69] | 11 | Asia\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 3,758[70] | 12 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 3,485[70] | 13 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 3,075[71] | 14 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2,794[72] | 15 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Belize | 2,349[73] | 16 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 2,327[74] | 17 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 2,299[75] | 18 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Colombia | 2,286[76] | 19 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 1,874[77] | 20 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 1,778[78] | 21 | South America\n |\n| The list includes also temporary residents (1–3 years' stay) |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexican diaspora\n |\n| --- |\n| Americas | * Argentina\n* Belize\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* El Salvador\n* Guatemala\n* Honduras\n* Panama\n* Paraguay\n* United States\n |\n| Asia | * Israel\n* Japan\n* Philippines\n |\n| Europe | * France\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Oceania | * Australia\n* New Zealand\n |\n\n## Cities and metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\n### Settlements, cities and municipalities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Mexico\n\nSee also: Municipalities of Mexico\n\n\n\n| Most populated municipalities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| *Municipality of Guadalajara* |\n| Municipality\n | Pop.

A city is defined to be a settlement with more than 2,500 inhabitants. In 2005 there were 2,640 cities with a population between 2,500 and 15,000 inhabitants, 427 with a population between 15,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 112 with a population between 100,000 and one million, and 11 with a population of more than one million.[79] All cities are considered \"urban areas\" and represent 76.5% of total population. Settlements with less than 2,500 inhabitants are considered \"rural communities\" (in fact, more than 80,000 of those settlements have only one or two housing units). Rural population in Mexico is 22.2% of total population.[79]\n\n\nMunicipalities (*municipios* in Spanish) and boroughs (*delegaciones* in Spanish) are incorporated places in Mexico, that is, second or third-level political divisions with internal autonomy, legally prescribed limits, powers and functions. In terms of second-level political divisions there are 2,438 municipalities and Mexico and 16 semi-autonomous boroughs (all within the Federal District). A municipality can be constituted by one or more cities one of which is the *cabecera municipal* (municipal seat). Cities are usually contained within the limits of a single municipality, with a few exceptions in which small areas of one city may extend to other adjacent municipalities *without* incorporating the city which serves as the municipal seat of the adjacent municipality. Some municipalities or cities within municipalities are further divided into *delegaciones* or boroughs. However, unlike the boroughs of the Federal District, these are third-level administrative divisions; they have very limited autonomy and no elective representatives.\n\n\nMunicipalities in central Mexico are usually very small in area and thus coextensive with cities (as is the case of Guadalajara, Puebla and León), whereas municipalities in northern and southeastern Mexico are much larger and usually contain more than one city or town that may not necessarily conform a single urban agglomeration (as is the case of Tijuana).\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexican woman from Ajuchitlán del Progreso, a Nahua area, (2021).\nA metropolitan area in Mexico is defined to be the group of municipalities that heavily interact with each other, usually around a core city.[80] In 2004, a joint effort between CONAPO, INEGI and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) agreed to define metropolitan areas as either:[80]\n\n\n\n* the group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or\n* a single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality); or\n* a city with a population of at least 250,000 which forms a conurbation with other cities in the United States of America.\n\n\nIn 2004 there were 55 metropolitan areas in Mexico, in which close to 53% of the country's population lives. The most populous metropolitan area in Mexico is the *Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico*, or Greater Mexico City, which in 2005 had a population of 19.23 million, or 19% of the nation's population. The next four largest metropolitan areas in Mexico are Greater Guadalajara (4.1 million), Greater Monterrey (3.7 million), Greater Puebla (2.1 million) and Greater Toluca (1.6 million),[81] whose added population, along with Greater Mexico City, is equivalent to 30% of the nation's population. Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country since the 1930s until the late 1980s. Since then, the country has slowly become economically and demographically less centralized. From 2000 to 2005 the average annual growth rate of Greater Mexico City was the lowest of the five largest metropolitan areas, whereas the fastest growing metropolitan area was Puebla (2.0%) followed by Monterrey (1.9%), Toluca (1.8%) and Guadalajara (1.8%).[81]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Mexico2020 National Population Census[82]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Valley of Mexico](image)Valley of Mexico![Monterrey](image)Monterrey | 1 | Valley of Mexico | Mexico City, State of Mexico, Hidalgo | 21,804,515 | 11 | Aguascalientes | Aguascalientes | 1,225,432\n | ![Guadalajara](image)Guadalajara![Puebla–Tlaxcala](image)Puebla–Tlaxcala |\n| 2 | Monterrey | Nuevo León | 5,341,171 | 12 | San Luis Potosí | San Luis Potosí | 1,221,526\n |\n| 3 | Guadalajara | Jalisco | 5,286,642 | 13 | Mérida | Yucatán | 1,201,000\n |\n| 4 | Puebla–Tlaxcala | Puebla, Tlaxcala | 3,199,530 | 14 | Mexicali | Baja California | 1,031,779\n |\n| 5 | Toluca | State of Mexico | 2,353,924 | 15 | Saltillo | Coahuila | 1,031,779\n |\n| 6 | Tijuana | Baja California | 2,157,853 | 16 | Cuernavaca | Morelos | 1,028,589\n |\n| 7 | León | Guanajuato | 1,924,771 | 17 | Culiacán | Sinaloa | 1,003,530\n |\n| 8 | Querétaro | Querétaro | 1,594,212 | 18 | Morelia | Michoacán | 988,704\n |\n| 9 | Juárez | Chihuahua | 1,512,450 | 19 | Chihuahua | Chihuahua | 988,065\n |\n| 10 | La Laguna | Coahuila, Durango | 1,434,283 | 20 | Veracruz | Veracruz | 939,046\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Latin America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.[83] Distribution of Admixture Estimates for Individuals from Mexico City and Quetalmahue (indigenous community in Chile).\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014, each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[84]\n![](image)Trivate for ancestry, from the same study as the image above.[84]\nDemographic statistics according to the 2022 World Population Review.[85]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 15 seconds\n* One death every 39 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 24 seconds\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[86]\n\n\n\n### Median age[edit]\n\n\ntotal: 29.3 years.

The second article of the Mexican Constitution defines the country to be a pluricultural state originally based on its indigenous peoples.\n\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, the majority of Mexicans are united under the same national identity.[87] This is the product of an ideology strongly promoted by Mexican academics such as Manuel Gamio and José Vasconcelos known as mestizaje, whose goal was that of Mexico becoming a racially and culturally homogeneous country.[88][87][89] The ideology's influence was reflected in Mexico's national censuses of 1921 and 1930: in the former, which was Mexico's first-ever national census (but second-ever if the census made in colonial times is taken into account)[90] that considered race, approximately 60% of Mexico's population identified as Mestizos,[91] and in the latter, Mexico's government declared that all Mexicans were now Mestizos, for which racial classifications would be dropped in favor of language-based ones in future censuses.[92] During most of the 20th century these censuses' results were taken as fact, with extraofficial international publications often using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition,[93][94][95] but in recent time historians and academics have claimed that said results are not accurate, as in its efforts to homogenize Mexico, the government inflated the Mestizo label's percentage by classifying a good number of people as such regardless of whether they were of actual mixed ancestry or not,[96][97][98][99] pointing out that an alteration so drastic of population trends compared to earlier censuses such as New Spain's 1793 census (on which Europeans were estimated to be 18% to 22% of the population, Mestizos 21% to 25% and Indigenous peoples 51% to 61%)[90] is not possible and that the frequency of marriages between people of different ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico was low.[100][101] It is also observed that when asked directly about their ethno-racial identification, many Mexicans nowadays do not identify as Mestizos,[102] would not agree to be labeled as such,[103] and that \"static\" ethnoracial labels such as \"White\" “Black” or \"Indian\" are far more prominent in contemporary Mexican society than the \"Mestizo\" one is, whose use is mostly limited to intellectual circles, a result of the label's constantly-changing and subjective definition.[104]\n\n\n\n### Mestizo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mestizos in Mexico\n\n![](image)President Porfirio Diaz was of Mestizo descent\nA large majority of Mexicans have been classified as \"Mestizos\", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating elements from both indigenous and Spanish traditions. By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments, the \"Mestizo identity\" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as *mestizaje* [mestiˈsaxe]. Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity upon this concept.[105][106]\n\n\nSince the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country, a good number of phenotypically white people identifying with it, leading to being considered Mestizos in Mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due to the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones.[107] A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos: while the term *Mestizo* is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, In Mexican society an indigenous person can be considered mestizo.[108] and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.[109][110][111] In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has a different meaning, with it being to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as Mestizos.[99] In Chiapas the word \"Ladino\" is used instead of mestizo.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)Diego Boneta Mexican actor and singer.\nGiven that the word Mestizo has different meanings in Mexico, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the *Encyclopædia Britannica*, which uses a biology-based approach, between one half and two-thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo[113] whereas a culture-based criteria estimates a percentage as high as 90%.[92] Recent research based on self-identification nonetheless, has observed that many Mexicans do not identify as mestizos[102] and would not agree to be labeled as such,[103] with \"static\" racial labels such as White, Indian, Black etc. being more commonly used.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Climate activist Xiye Bastida, daughter of an Otomi father and Celtic mother.\nThe use of variated methods and criteria to quantify the number of Mestizos in Mexico is not new: Since several decades ago, many authors have analyzed colonial censuses data and have made different conjectures respecting the ethnic composition of the population of colonial Mexico/New Spain. There are Historians such as Gonzalo Aguirre-Beltrán who claimed in 1972 that practically the totality of New Spain's population, in reality, were Mestizos, using to back up his claims arguments such as that affairs of Spaniards with non-Europeans due to the alleged absence of female European immigrants were widespread as well as there being a huge desire of Mestizos to \"pass\" as Spaniards, this because Spanishness was seen as a symbol of high status.[114][115] Other historians however, point that Aguirre-Beltran numbers tend to have inconsistencies and take too much liberties (it is pointed out in the book *Ensayos sobre historia de la población. México y el Caribe 2* published in 1998 that on 1646, when according to historic registers the mestizo population was of 1% he estimates it to be 16.6% already, with this being attributed to him interpreting the data in a way convenient for a historic narrative),[116][97] often omitting data of New Spain's northern and western provinces.[117] His self-made classifications thus, although could be plausible, are not useful for precise statistical analysis.[118] According 21st-century historians, Aguirre Beltran also disregards facts such as the population dynamics of New Spain being different depending on the region at hand (i.e. miscegenation couldn't happen in a significant amount in regions on which the native population was openly hostile until early 20th century, such as most of New Spain's internal provinces, which nowadays are the northern and western regions of Mexico),[97] or that historic accounts made by investigators at the time consistently observed that New Spain's European population was notoriously concerned with preserving their European heritage, with practices such as inviting relatives and friends directly from Spain or favoring Europeans for marriage even if they were from a lower socioeconomic level than them being common.[119][116][97] Newer publications that do cite Aguirre-Beltran's work take those factors into consideration, stating that the Spaniard/Euromestizo/Criollo ethnic label was composed on its majority by descendants of Europeans albeit the category may have included people with some non-European ancestry.[120]\n\n\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples of Mexico\n\n![](image)President Benito Juarez was of Zapotec ancestry. He became the first Amerindian president in the Americas.\nPrior to contact with Europeans the indigenous people of Mexico had not had any kind of shared identity.[121] Indigenous identity was constructed by the dominant Euro-Mestizo majority and imposed upon the indigenous people as a negatively defined identity, characterized by the lack of assimilation into modern Mexico. Indigenous identity therefore became socially stigmatizing.[122] Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to help indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into mestizo communities.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)Actress Yalitza Aparicio, daughter of a Mixtec father and Triqui mother.\nThe category of \"indígena\" (indigenous) in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria throughout history. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as \"indigenous\" varies according to the definition applied. It can be defined narrowly according to a linguistic criterion, including only persons that speak an Indigenous language. Based on this criterion, approximately 6.1% of the population is Indigenous.[124][125] Nonetheless, activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criterion for census purposes as \"statistical genocide.\"[126][127]  \n Other surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self-identify as Indigenous.\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups,[128] which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.[129]  \n Finally, according to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government in 2015, Indigenous people make up 21.5% of Mexico's population. In this occasion, people who self-identified as \"Indigenous\" and people who self-identified as \"partially Indigenous\" were classified in the \"Indigenous\" category altogether.[130]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Largest indigenous peoples\n |\n| --- |\n| *Mayas in Chiapas* |\n| Group\n | Number\n |\n| Nahua peoples (Nawatlaka)\n | 2,445,969\n |\n| Maya (Maaya)\n | 1,475,575\n |\n| Zapotec (Binizaa)\n | 777,253\n |\n| Mixtec (Ñuu sávi)\n | 726,601\n |\n| Otomí (Hñähñü)\n | 646,875\n |\n| Totonac (Tachihuiin)\n | 411,266\n |\n| Source: CDI (2000) [4] Archived September 15, 2019, at the Wayback Machine |\n\n\nThe Mexican constitution not only recognizes the 62 indigenous peoples living in Mexican territory but also grants them autonomy and protects their culture and languages. This protection and autonomy is extended to those Amerindian ethnic groups which have migrated from the United States – like the Cherokees and Kickapoos — and Guatemala during the 19th and 20th centuries. Municipalities in which indigenous peoples are located can keep their normative traditional systems in relation to the election of their municipal authorities. This system is known as *Usos y Costumbres*, roughly translated as \"customs and traditions\".\n\n\nAccording to official statistics —as reported by the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples or CDI— Amerindians make up 10–14%[131] of the country's population, more than half of them (5.4% of total population) speak an indigenous language and a tenth (1.2% of total population) do not speak Spanish.[132] Official statistics of the CDI[133] report that the states with the greatest percentage of people who speak an Amerindian language or identify as Amerindian are Yucatán (59%), Oaxaca (48%), Quintana Roo (39%), Chiapas (28%), Campeche (27%), Hidalgo (24%), Puebla (19%), Guerrero (17%), San Luis Potosí (15%) and Veracruz (15%). Oaxaca is the state with the greatest number of distinct indigenous peoples and languages in the country.\n\n\n\n### White Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Mexicans\n\n![](image)An 18th-century portrait of the Fagoaga Arozqueta family, an upper-class family of Basque descent from Mexico City.\nWhite Mexicans are Mexican citizens of full or majority European descent.[134] This ethnic group contrasts with the Afro-Mexican and Indigenous Mexican groups in the fact that phenotype (hair color, skin color etc.) is often used as the main criterion to delineate it.[135][136][134] Spaniards and other Europeans began arriving in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and continued immigrating to the country during colonial and independent Mexico. According to 20th- and 21st-century academics, large scale intermixing between the European immigrants and the native Indigenous peoples would produce a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population by the time of the Mexican revolution.[137] However, according to church registers from the colonial times, the majority (73%) of Spanish men married with Spanish women. Said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics, such as European immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that \"pure Spanish\" people were all part of a small powerful elite as Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities[138][139] as there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin.[140]\n\n\nEstimates of Mexico's white population differ greatly in both, methodology and percentages given, extra-official sources such as The World Factbook and Encyclopedia Britannica, which use the 1921 census results as the base of their estimations, calculate Mexico's White population as only 9%[141] or between one tenth to one fifth[142] (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate).[101] Surveys that account for phenotypical traits and have performed actual field research suggest rather higher percentages: using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as white, the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at 23%.[143] With a similar methodology, the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of 18.8% having its higher frequency on the North region (22.3%–23.9%) followed by the Center region (18.4%–21.3%) and the South region (11.9%).[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ricardo Peralta y Fabi mechanical engineer and former astronaut trainee.\nAnother study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of 18% and 28% respectively,[84] surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported a percentages of 47% in 2010[145][146][147] and 49% in 2017[148][149] respectively. A study performed in hospitals of Mexico City reported that an average 51.8% of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the Mongolian spot.[150] The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency (85–95%) in Asian, Native American, and African children.[151] The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American[152] and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos,[153] while having a very low frequency (5–10%) in Caucasian children.[154] According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the Mongolian spot.[155]\n\n\nMexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European population, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry, resembling in aspect that of northern Spaniards.[156] In the north and west of Mexico, the indigenous populations were substantially smaller than those found in central and southern Mexico, and also much less organized, thus they remained isolated from the rest of the population or even in some cases were hostile towards Mexican colonists. The northeast region, in which the indigenous population was eliminated by early European settlers, became the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Mennonite family in Campeche.\nWhile the majority of European immigration to Mexico has been Spanish with the first wave starting with the colonization of America and the last one being a consequence of the Spanish Civil War of 1937,[157] immigrants from other European countries have arrived to Mexico as well: during the Second Mexican Empire the immigration was mostly French, and during the late 19th and early 20th centuries spurred by government policies of Porfirio Díaz, migrants mainly from Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany followed taking advantage of the liberal policies then valid in Mexico and went into merchant, industrial and educational ventures while others arrived with no or limited capital, as employees or farmers.[158] Most settled in Mexico City, Veracruz, Yucatán, and Puebla. Significant numbers of German immigrants also arrived during and after the First and Second World Wars.[30][159] Additionally small numbers of White Americans, Croats, Greeks, Poles, Romanians, Russians and Ashkenazi Jews came.[159] The European Jewish immigrants joined the Sephardic community that lived in Mexico since colonial times, though many lived as Crypto-Jews, mostly in the northern states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas.[160] Some communities of European immigrants have remained isolated from the rest of the general population since their arrival, among them the German-speaking Mennonites from Russia of Chihuahua and Durango,[161] and the Venetos of Chipilo, Puebla, which have retained their original languages.[162]\n\n\nHowever, ethnicity in Mexico is not as clear cut as it is in the English speaking world, and \"mestizos\" are somewhat prone to identifying as \"white\" if asked. According to Pew Research, 60% of Mexicans identify as white when asked about their race.[163]\n\n\n\n### Afro-Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Afro-Mexicans\n\n![](image)Afromestiza girls in Cuajinicuilapa, Guerrero\n![Painting of Vicente Guerrero, major figure during the late Mexican War of Independence, abolitionist and second President of Mexico, was an Afro-Mexican.](image)Vicente Guerrero, major figure during the late Mexican War of Independence and second President of Mexico, was an Afro-descendent through his mother.[164]\nAfro-Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico, such as the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, Veracruz (e.g. Yanga) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of black people in Mexico is often unknown, denied or diminished both in Mexico and abroad for different reasons: their small numbers, continuous intermarriage and assimilation with non-African populations over various generations, as was often the case in Spanish territories and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a \"mestizaje\" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade during the colonial period, but it wasn't as prominent as the one seen elsewhere in the Americas, which led to the number of free black people eventually surpassing that of enslaved ones. The institution was already in decay by the late 1700s and by the 19th century slavery and ethnic categorization at birth (see casta) have been abolished with the Mexican independence. After this the creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past, actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.\n\n\nThe majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are *Afromestizos.* Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 2.4% of Mexico's population,[124] the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of indigenous languages.[130]\n\n\nA number of black Mexicans descend from recent immigrants from Haiti, Africa, and rest of the Caribbean.\n\n\n\n### Arab Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arab Mexicans\n\n![](image)Susana Harp Mexican singer and currently serves as a senator.\nAn Arab Mexican is a Mexican citizen of Arabic-speaking origin who can be of various ancestral origins. The vast majority of Mexico's 1.1 million Arabs are from either Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, or Palestinian background.[31]\n\n\nThe interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Arab community in Mexico shows marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language. Today, the most common Arabic surnames in Mexico include Nader, Hayek, Ali, Haddad, Nasser, Malik, Abed, Mansoor, Harb and Elias.\n\n\nArab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries.[165] Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq and settled in significant numbers in Nayarit, Puebla, Mexico City and the northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara. The term \"Arab Mexican\" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.\n\n\n\n![](image)Engineer Carlos Slim\nDuring the Israel-Lebanon war in 1948 and during the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico. They first arrived in Veracruz. Although Arabs made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.[31]\n\n\nImmigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, where they have introduced Kibbeh, Tabbouleh and even created recipes such as *Tacos Árabes*. By 1765, Dates, which originated from the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards.[166] The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine.[167]\n\n\nAnother concentration of Arab-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the U.S.-Mexican border, esp. in cities of Mexicali in the Imperial Valley U.S./Mexico, and Tijuana across from San Diego with a large Arab American community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. 45% of Arab Mexicans are of Lebanese descent.\n\n\nThe majority of Arab-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches.[168] A scant number are Muslims.\n\n\n\n#### Asian Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Mexicans\n\n![](image)Kavka Shishido drummer and vocalist.\nAlthough Asian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern Mexico, they are nonetheless a notable minority. Due to the historical and contemporary perception in Mexican society of what constitutes Asian culture (associated with the Far East rather than the Near East), Asian Mexicans typically refers to those of East Asian descent, and may also include those of South and Southeast Asian descent. For Mexicans of West Asian descent, see the Middle Eastern Mexicans section.\n\n\nAsian immigration began with the arrival of Filipinos to Mexico during the Spanish period. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon assisting Spain in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Also on these voyages, thousands of Asian individuals (mostly males) were brought to Mexico as slaves and were called \"Chino\",[169] which means Chinese, although in reality they were of diverse origins, including Koreans, Japanese, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Cambodians, Timorese, and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China.[170][171][172] A notable example is the story of Catarina de San Juan (Mirra), an Indian girl captured by the Portuguese and sold into slavery in Manila. She arrived in New Spain and eventually she gave rise to the \"China Poblana\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Nishizawa was a Mexican artist.\nThese early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread *mestizaje* of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of *Chino* slaves to \"pass\" as *Indios* (the indigenous people of Mexico) to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general Mestizo population. Facilitating this miscegenation was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from chattel slavery, and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.\n\n\nAsians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.[173]\n\n\n\n### Romani Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Romani Mexicans\n\nRomani people have settled in Mexico since the colonial era.[174] There are around 50,000 Vlax Romani in Mexico.[175]\n\n\n\n### Official censuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arcelia Ramírez Mexican actress\nHistorically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require: the first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as New Spain) first ever nationwide population census. Since only part of its original datasets survive, most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who back in the day used the census' findings as reference for their own works. More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in 1921 (some sources assert that the census of 1895 included a comprehensive racial classification;[137] however, according to the historic archives of Mexico's National Institute of Statistics, that was not the case).[176] While the 1921 census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification, in recent years it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them.\n\n\n\n#### 1793 census[edit]\n\n\nAlso known as the \"Revillagigedo census\" from the name of the Count who ordered that it be conducted, this census was the first nationwide population census of Mexico (then known as the Viceroyalty of New Spain). Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, so most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works, such as Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary greatly, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61%, and Africans from 6,000 and 10,000. The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%–17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies in their suffering higher mortality rates due to living in remote locations rather than in cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or in being at war with them. For the same reasons, the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greatest variation range between publications, as in some cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.[177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Intendecy or territory\n | European population (%)\n | Indigenous population (%)\n | Mestizo population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| México (only the State of Mexico and Mexico City)\n | 16.9%\n | 66.1%\n | 16.7%\n |\n| Puebla | 10.1%\n | 74.3%\n | 15.3%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 06.3%\n | 88.2%\n | 05.2%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 25.8%\n | 44.0%\n | 29.9%\n |\n| San Luis Potosí | 13.0%\n | 51.2%\n | 35.7%\n |\n| Zacatecas | 15.8%\n | 29.0%\n | 55.1%\n |\n| Durango | 20.2%\n | 36.0%\n | 43.5%\n |\n| Sonora | 28.5%\n | 44.9%\n | 26.4%\n |\n| Yucatán | 14.8%\n | 72.6%\n | 12.3%\n |\n| Guadalajara | 31.7%\n | 33.3%\n | 34.7%\n |\n| Veracruz | 10.4%\n | 74.0%\n | 15.2%\n |\n| Valladolid | 27.6%\n | 42.5%\n | 29.6%\n |\n| Nuevo México | ~\n | 30.8%\n | 69.0%\n |\n| Vieja California | ~\n | 51.7%\n | 47.9%\n |\n| Nueva California | ~\n | 89.9%\n | 09.8%\n |\n| Coahuila | 30.9%\n | 28.9%\n | 40.0%\n |\n| Nuevo León | 62.6%\n | 05.5%\n | 31.6%\n |\n| Nuevo Santander | 25.8%\n | 23.3%\n | 50.8%\n |\n| Texas | 39.7%\n | 27.3%\n | 32.4%\n |\n| Tlaxcala | 13.6%\n | 72.4%\n | 13.8%\n |\n\n\n~Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.\n\n\nRegardless of the possible inaccuracies related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside of the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put into considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens or subjects; for example, the censuses made by the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.[178] Another example is the censuses made by the United States, which did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until 1860, and indigenous peoples as a whole until 1900.[179]\n\n\n\n#### 1921 census[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eulalio Gutiérrez (1881–1939), flanked by Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa (1878–1923) and Emiliano Zapata (1879–1919). Gutiérrez was appointed provisional President of Mexico by the Convention of Aguascalientes, a move that Venustiano Carranza (1859–1920) found intolerable. In the ensuing war, Obregón fought for Carranza against the convention.\nMade right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution, the social context in which this census was conducted makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking to unite all Mexicans in a single national identity. The 1921 census' final results in regards to race, which assert that 59.3% of the Mexican population self-identified as Mestizo, 29.1% as Indigenous, and only 9.8% as White, were then essential in cementing the *mestizaje* ideology (which asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races), which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the 20th century and remains prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as *The World Factbook* and *Encyclopædia Britannica* using the 1921 census as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day.[93][113]\n\n\nNonetheless, in recent times, the census' results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians, academics and social activists alike, who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the 1793 census are impossible and cite, among other statistics, the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.[180] It is claimed that the *mestizaje* process sponsored by the state was more \"cultural than biological\", which resulted in the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races.[181] Controversies aside, this census constituted the last time the Mexican Government conducted a comprehensive racial census with the breakdown by states being the following (foreigners and people who answered \"other\" not included):[182]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Federative Units\n | Mestizo Population (%)\n | Amerindian Population (%)\n | White Population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aguascalientes | 66.12%\n | 16.70%\n | 16.77%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Norte) | 72.50%\n | 07.72%\n | 00.35%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Sur) | 59.61%\n | 06.06%\n | 33.40%\n |\n| Campeche | 41.45%\n | 43.41%\n | 14.17%\n |\n| Coahuila | 77.88%\n | 11.38%\n | 10.13%\n |\n| Colima | 68.54%\n | 26.00%\n | 04.50%\n |\n| Chiapas | 36.27%\n | 47.64%\n | 11.82%\n |\n| Chihuahua | 50.09%\n | 12.76%\n | 36.33%\n |\n| Durango | 89.85%\n | 09.99%\n | 00.01%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 96.33%\n | 02.96%\n | 00.54%\n |\n| Guerrero | 54.05%\n | 43.84%\n | 02.07%\n |\n| Hidalgo | 51.47%\n | 39.49%\n | 08.83%\n |\n| Jalisco | 75.83%\n | 16.76%\n | 07.31%\n |\n| Mexico City | 54.78%\n | 18.75%\n | 22.79%\n |\n| State of Mexico | 47.71%\n | 42.13%\n | 10.02%\n |\n| Michoacán | 70.95%\n | 21.04%\n | 06.94%\n |\n| Morelos | 61.24%\n | 34.93%\n | 03.59%\n |\n| Nayarit | 73.45%\n | 20.38%\n | 05.83%\n |\n| Nuevo León | 75.47%\n | 05.14%\n | 19.23%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 28.15%\n | 69.17%\n | 01.43%\n |\n| Puebla | 39.34%\n | 54.73%\n | 05.66%\n |\n| Querétaro | 80.15%\n | 19.40%\n | 00.30%\n |\n| Quintana Roo | 42.35%\n | 20.59%\n | 15.16%\n |\n| San Luis Potosí | 61.88%\n | 30.60%\n | 05.41%\n |\n| Sinaloa | 98.30%\n | 00.93%\n | 00.19%\n |\n| Sonora | 41.04%\n | 14.00%\n | 42.54%\n |\n| Tabasco | 53.67%\n | 18.50%\n | 27.56%\n |\n| Tamaulipas | 69.77%\n | 13.89%\n | 13.62%\n |\n| Tlaxcala | 42.44%\n | 54.70%\n | 02.53%\n |\n| Veracruz | 50.09%\n | 36.60%\n | 10.28%\n |\n| Yucatán | 33.83%\n | 43.31%\n | 21.85%\n |\n| Zacatecas | 86.10%\n | 08.54%\n | 05.26%\n |\n\n\nWhen the 1921 census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses[130] as well as with modern genetic research,[183] there is high consistency with respect to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both the highest percentages of population who self-identify as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry. However, this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances in which states that have been shown through scientific research to have a considerably high European ancestry are reported to have very small white populations in the 1921 census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 0.01% of the state's population (33 persons) self-identified as \"white\" while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequencies to those found on European peoples (with the state's Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either).[184] Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government, which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify themselves as such.[107][185]\n\n\n\n#### The present day[edit]\n\n\nThe following table is a compilation of, when possible, official nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexican government which have attempted to quantify different Mexican ethnic groups. Given that, for the most part, each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race or ethnicity\n | Population (est.)\n | Percentage (est.)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Indigenous | 26,000,000\n | 21.5%\n | 2015[130] |\n| Black | 2,576,213\n | 2.4%\n | 2020[186] |\n| White | 56,000,000\n | 47.0%\n | 2010[145][146][147] |\n| Foreigners residing in Mexico (of any race)\n | 1,010,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2015[187] |\n| East Asian | 1,000,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[188] |\n| Middle Eastern | 400,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[189] |\n| Jewish | 68,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[190] |\n| Muslim | 4,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2015[191] |\n| Unclassified (most likely Mestizos)\n | 37,300,000\n | 30.0%\n | –\n |\n| Total\n | 123,500,000\n | 100%\n | 2017[192] |\n\n\nOf all the ethnic groups that have been surveyed, Mestizos are notably absent, which is likely due to the label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates its precise quantification. However it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. For example, the 2015 intercensal survey considered individuals who self-identified as \"part Indigenous\" or \"part African\" as part of a combined group of Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether. Such people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits and appearance. Thus, technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his or her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, relatively low in number, have more permissive classification criteria. Some of these ethnicities are faiths. Therefore, a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to at least one of these ethnicities.\nNonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of \"race\" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one, and that to society's eyes, a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered \"white\", and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered \"Indian\", a person who identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he or she doesn't completely belong to that group.[193]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Mexico\n\nLanguages in Mexico (by percentage):[194]\n\n\n\nSpanish (92.7%)\nSpanish and indigenous languages (5.7%)\nindigenous (0.8%)\nunspecified (0.8%)\n\nSpanish is the *de facto* official language in Mexico being spoken by 98.3% of the population.[195] Mexican Spanish is spoken in a variety of dialects, accents and variations in different regions across the country.\n\n\nSome indigenous languages are still being spoken by around 5% of Mexicans according to the latest census, in 2003 the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples recognized 68 indigenous languages as \"national languages\", with the \"same validity\" in all territories and contexts where they are spoken. The indigenous language with the greatest number of speakers is Nahuatl (1,586,884 speakers in 2010 or 1.5% of the nation's population), followed by Yucatec Maya (796,405 speakers in 2010 0.8%) spoken Yucatán Peninsula, Mixtecas languages (494,454), Tzeltal (474,298), Zapotecas languages (460,683), Tzotzil (429,168), Otomí (288,052), Totonaca (250,252) Mazateco (230,124), Chol (222,051) and 1,462,857 speakers of other languages. After half a century of rural-to-urban migration, in Mexico City and other major cities large districts and sections use both written and spoken Amerindian languages.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the government promoted a policy of *castellanización*, that is, promoting the use of Spanish as a way to integrate indigenous peoples into Mexican society. Later, this policy changed, and since the 1980s the government has sponsored bilingual and intercultural education in all indigenous communities. This policy has mainly been successful in large communities with a significant number of speakers. While some languages, with less than 1,000 speakers, are still facing extinction.\n\n\nThe second most spoken language in Mexico, however, is English. It is used extensively at border areas, tourist centers and large metropolitan areas, a phenomenon arguably caused by the economic integration of North American under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the immigration phenomenon and the return of workers and their families from the United States.[196] In border cities, American TV and radio waves in English (and Spanish) are received as much Spanish-speaking radio and TV stations from Mexico on the US side of the border, thus a bilingual cross-cultural exchange is at work.\n\n\nAmong the languages brought to the country by immigrants are the Venetian of Chipilo, and Mennonite Low German spoken in Durango and Chihuahua.\n\n\n\n## Mexican nationality and citizenship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexican passport\nMain article: Mexican nationality law\n\nThe Constitution of Mexico grants Mexican nationality based on birth and naturalization. Mexican laws regarding nationality by birth are very open. Mexican nationality by birth is granted to:[197]\n\n\n\n* all those individuals born in Mexican territory,\n* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by birth,\n* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by naturalization,\n* all those individuals born aboard Mexican aircraft or sea vessels, whether warships or commercial vessels.\n\n\nMexican nationality by naturalization is granted to:[197]\n\n\n\n* foreign citizens granted Mexican nationality by the Secretariat of Government (Ministry of the Interior);\n* foreign citizens married to a Mexican national, whether by birth or naturalization.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Mexico\n\nReligion in Mexico (by percentage):[194]\n\n\n\nRoman Catholic (82.7%)\nEvangelical Churches (5%)\nPentecostal (1.6%)\nJehovah's Witnesses (1.4%)\nother (1.9%)\nnone (4.7%)\nunspecified (2.7%)\n\nThe Mexican population is predominantly Catholic (78% of the population aged five and older, according to the 2020 census),[198] although the percentage representing those who attend church on a weekly basis is lower (46%).[199] About 7.6% of the population was classified as Protestant or Evangelical, 2.5% were classified as \"Non-Evangelical Biblical\" (a classification that groups Adventists, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses), 0.05% as practicing Jews, and 4.6% without a religion.[200] The largest group of Protestants are Pentecostals and Charismatics (classified as Neo-Pentecostals).\n\n\n\n![](image)Church of Archangel Michael — from the town of Comala, in the state of Colima.\nThe states with the highest percentage of professing Catholics are central states, namely Guanajuato (96.4%), Aguascalientes (95.6%) and Jalisco (95.4%), whereas southeastern states have the lowest percentage of Catholics, namely Chiapas (63.8%), Tabasco (70.4%) and Campeche (71.3%).[200] The percentage of professing Catholics has been on the decrease over the last four decades, from over 98% in 1950 to 78% in 2020.[198] The average annual growth of Catholic believers from 1990 to 2000 was 1.7% whereas that of non-Catholics was 3.7%.[201] Given that the average annual population increase over the same time period was 1.8%,[202] the percentage of Catholics in relation to the total population continues to be in overall decline.\n\n\nSince 1857 with the La Reforma laws, the Mexican Constitution drastically separates Church and State, unlike some other countries in Latin America or Ibero-America. The State does not support or provide any economic resource to the Church (as is the case in Spain and Argentina),[203] and the Church cannot participate in public education (no public school can be operated by a Catholic order, although they can participate in private education). Moreover, the government nationalized all the Church's properties (some of which were given back in the 1990s), and priests lost the right to vote or to be voted for (although in the 1990s they regained the right to vote).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of municipalities in Mexico by population\n* Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n* List of Mexican states by population\n* List of Mexican states by fertility rate\n* Economy of Mexico\n* Poverty in Mexico\n* Romani Mexicans\n\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"People and Society\". *cia.gov*.

The country is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region, lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally modified equatorial climate. As of 2023, it has a population of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala.\n\n\nUganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital Kampala, and whose language Luganda is widely spoken throughout the country. From 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the United Kingdom, which established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long military dictatorship led by Idi Amin.\n\n\n\n![Simple instrumental music sheet of the anthem of Uganda](image)Simple instrumental music sheet of the anthem of Uganda\nThe official language is English, although the Constitution states that \"any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative, administrative, or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law.\" Luganda, a central region-based language, is widely spoken across the Central and South Eastern regions of the country, and several other languages are also spoken including Ateso, Lango, Acholi, Runyoro, Runyankole, Rukiga, Luo, Rutooro, Samia, Jopadhola, and Lusoga. In 2005 Swahili, which is foreign and so viewed as being neutral, was proposed as Uganda's second official language, but this has yet to be ratified by parliament. However, in 2022 Uganda decided to make Swahili a mandatory subject in the school curriculum.\n\n\nUganda's current president is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who took power in January 1986 after a protracted six-year guerrilla war. Following constitutional amendments that removed term limits for the president, he was able to stand and was elected president in the 2011, 2016 and 2021 general elections.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Uganda\n\n### Precolonial Uganda[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early history of Uganda\n\n![](image)A caesarean section performed by indigenous healers in Kahura, in the kingdom of Buganda[11] (present-day Uganda) as observed by medical missionary Robert William Felkin in 1879.[12]\nMuch of Uganda was inhabited by Central sudanic- and Kuliak-speaking farmers and herders until 3,000 years ago, when Bantu speakers arrived in the south and Nilotic speakers arrived in the northeast. By 1500 AD, they had all been assimilated into Bantu speaking cultures south of Mount Elgon, the Nile River, and Lake Kyoga.[13]\n\n\nAccording to oral tradition and archeological studies, the Empire of Kitara covered an important part of the great lakes area, from the northern lakes Albert and Kyoga to the southern lakes Victoria and Tanganyika.[14] Bunyoro-Kitara is claimed as the antecedent of the Toro, Ankole, and Busoga kingdoms.[15]\n\n\nSome Luo invaded the area of Bunyoro and assimilated with the Bantu society there, establishing the Babiito dynasty of the current Omukama (ruler) of Bunyoro-Kitara.[16]\n\n\nArab traders moved into the land from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s for trade and commerce.[17] In the late 1860s, Bunyoro in Mid-Western Uganda found itself threatened from the north by Egyptian-sponsored agents.[18] Unlike the Arab traders from the East African coast who sought trade, these agents were promoting foreign conquest. In 1869, Khedive Ismail Pasha of Egypt, seeking to annex the territories north of the borders of Lake Victoria and east of Lake Albert and \"south of Gondokoro,\"[19] sent a British explorer, Samuel Baker, on a military expedition to the frontiers of Northern Uganda, with the objective of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and \"civilization.\" The Banyoro resisted Baker, who had to fight a desperate battle to secure his retreat. Baker regarded the resistance as an act of treachery, and he denounced the Banyoro in a book (*Ismailia – A Narrative Of The Expedition To Central Africa For The Suppression Of Slave Trade, Organised By Ismail, Khadive Of Egypt* (1874))[19] that was widely read in Britain. Later, the British arrived in Uganda with a predisposition against the kingdom of Bunyoro and sided with the kingdom of Buganda. This would eventually cost Bunyoro half of its territory, which was given to Buganda as a reward from the British. Two of the numerous \"lost counties\" were restored to Bunyoro after independence.\n\n\nIn the 1860s, while Arabs sought influence from the north, British explorers searching for the source of the Nile[20] arrived in Uganda. They were followed by British Anglican missionaries who arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in 1877 and French Catholic missionaries in 1879. This situation gave rise to the death of the Uganda Martyrs in 1885—after the conversion of Muteesa I and much of his court, and the succession of his anti-Christian son Mwanga.[21]\n\n\nThe British government chartered the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in 1888.[22]\n\n\nFrom 1886, there was a series of religious wars in Buganda, initially between Muslims and Christians and then, from 1890, between \"ba-Ingleza\" Protestants and \"ba-Fransa\" Catholics, factions named after the imperial powers with which they were aligned.[23][24] Because of civil unrest and financial burdens, IBEAC claimed that it was unable to \"maintain their occupation\" in the region.[25] British commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile, which prompted the British government to annex Buganda and adjoining territories to create the Uganda Protectorate in 1894.[22]: 3–4[26]\n\n\n\n### Uganda Protectorate (1894–1962)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Uganda Protectorate\n\n![](image)Flag of the Uganda Protectorate\nThe **Protectorate of Uganda** was a protectorate of the British Empire from 1894 to 1962. In 1893, the Imperial British East Africa Company transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of the Kingdom of Buganda to the British government. The IBEAC relinquished its control over Uganda after Ugandan internal religious wars had driven it into bankruptcy.[27]\n\n\nIn 1894, the Uganda Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda by signing more treaties with the other kingdoms (Toro in 1900,[28] Ankole in 1901, and Bunyoro in 1933[29]) to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day Uganda.[30]\n\n\nThe status of Protectorate had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring Kenya, insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration.[31]\n\n\nIn the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were recruited to East Africa under indentured labour contracts to construct the Uganda Railway.[32] Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion.[33] Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.[34]\n\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, a sleeping sickness epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.[35]\n\n\nWorld War II encouraged the colonial administration of Uganda to recruit 77,143 soldiers to serve in the King's African Rifles. They were seen in action in the Western Desert campaign, the Abyssinian campaign, the Battle of Madagascar and the Burma campaign.\n\n\n\n### Independence (1962 to 1965)[edit]\n\n\nUganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state and Queen of Uganda. In October 1963, Uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n\nThe first post-independence election, held in 1962, was won by an alliance between the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and Kabaka Yekka (KY). UPC and KY formed the first post-independence government with Milton Obote as executive prime minister, with the Buganda Kabaka (King) Edward Muteesa II holding the largely ceremonial position of president.[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Buganda crisis (1962–1966)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mengo Crisis\n\n![](image)Construction of the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja\nUganda's immediate post-independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom – Buganda.[38]\n\n\nFrom the moment the British created the Uganda protectorate, the issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had always been a problem. Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.[39]\n\n\nWithin Buganda, there were divisions – between those who wanted the Kabaka to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties – the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the Democratic Party (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, Benedicto Kiwanuka.[40]\n\n\nOutside Buganda, a soft-spoken politician from Northern Uganda, Milton Obote, had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC). The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda's special status. This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda. The party however remained a loose alliance of interests, but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Uganda printers building on Kampala Road, Kampala, Uganda\nAt Independence, the Buganda question remained unresolved. Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament. In the pre-Independence elections, the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats (outside Buganda). The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda. The \"special status\" granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament – the Lukikko. KY won a resounding victory over DP, winning all 21 seats.\n\n\nThe UPC reached a high at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, Basil Kiiza Bataringaya, crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs, leaving DP with only nine seats. The DP MPs were not particularly happy that the hostility of their leader, Benedicto Kiwanuka, towards the Kabaka was hindering their chances of compromise with KY.[42] The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda.[43] The response from the Kabaka was mute – probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time Uganda had become independent, Buganda \"was a divided house with contending social and political forces\"[44] There were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional, and personal interests began to shake the party. The party's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.[45]\n\n\nThe UPC delegates arrived in Gulu in 1964 for their delegates conference. Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party. The battle over the Secretary-General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate's candidate – Grace Ibingira and the radical John Kakonge. Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC. This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government. For those outside the UPC (including KY supporters), this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable. Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit.[46]\n\n\nThe collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda's \"special status\". In 1964, the government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka's subjects. Prior to colonial rule, Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring Bunyoro kingdom. Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements. Known as the \"lost counties\", the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro. Obote decided to allow a referendum, which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda. The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka's attempts to influence the vote.[47] Having lost the referendum, KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro, thus ending the alliance with the UPC.\n\n\nThe tribal nature of Ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government. The UPC which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC. The \"North/South\" ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics. Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians – A. A. Neykon, Felix Onama, Alex Ojera – while Ibingira's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him, were mainly from the South – George Magezi, B. Kirya, Matthias Ngobi. In time, the two factions acquired ethnic labels – \"Bantu\" (the mainly Southern Ibingira faction) and \"Nilotic\" (the mainly Northern Obote faction). The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Grey Crowned Crane – a symbol of Uganda\nThese labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences. First Buganda – the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction. The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka.[48] They were now aligned to opposing Obote. Second – the security forces – the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles. At independence, the army and police was dominated by northern tribes – mainly Nilotic. They would now feel more affiliated to Obote, and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power. In April 1966, Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at Moroto, of whom seventy percent came from the Northern Region.[49]\n\n\nAt the time there was a tendency to perceive central government and security forces as dominated by \"northerners\" – particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at national level.[50] In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings, particularly over the kingdom's \"special status\" before and after independence, and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status. \"Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state, both through the civil service and military, and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda\".[50] However, both \"Bantu\" and \"Nilotic\" labels represent significant ambiguities. The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro – historically bitter rivals. The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara, Acholi, and Langi, all of whom have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda's military politics later. Despite these ambiguities, these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics.\n\n\nThe UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote's vulnerability. At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders. Even in Obote's home district, attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966. A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 – and without the support of KY (who were now likely to back the DP), and the growing factionalism in the UPC, there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months.\n\n\nObote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda. KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs, the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng. Ochieng was an irony – although from Northern Uganda, he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda. In Obote's absence from Parliament, Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote's army chief of staff, Colonel Idi Amin. He further alleged that Obote, Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme.[51] Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote's involvement. This shook the government and raised tensions in the country.\n\n\nKY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference where Godfrey Binaisa (the Attorney General) was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY, Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda.[44] Obote's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966. In March 1966, Obote also announced that the offices of President and vice-president would cease to exist – effectively dismissing the Kabaka. Obote also gave Amin more power – giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder (Opolot) who had relations to Buganda through marriage (possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that). Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months. Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup. Obote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures:\n\n\n\n* The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units. This removed the Kabaka's authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda.\n* The abolition of the Buganda High Court – removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had.\n* The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control.\n* Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs. Land is one of the key sources of Kabaka's power over his subjects.\n\n\nThe lines were now drawn for a show down between Buganda and the Central government. Historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise. This was unlikely as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak. Indeed, by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC, the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other. Within Buganda's political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained. The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.[52]\n\n\nIn May 1966, the Kabaka made his move. He asked for foreign help, and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda (including the capital, Kampala). In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka's palace. The battle for the Kabaka's palace was fierce – the Kabaka's guards putting up more resistance than had been expected. The British trained Captain – the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours.[53] It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.\n\n\n\n### 1966–1971 (before the coup)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president. In 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms. Obote was declared the president.[21]\n\n\n\n### 1971 (after the coup) –1979 (end of Amin regime)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Uganda (1971–79)\n\nAfter a military coup on 25 January 1971, Obote was deposed from power and General Idi Amin seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda as dictator with the support of the military for the next eight years.[54] He carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 80,000–500,000 Ugandans died during his regime.[55] Aside from his brutalities, he forcibly removed the entrepreneurial Indian minority from Uganda.[56] In June 1976, Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air France flight and forced it to land at Entebbe airport. One hundred of the 250 passengers originally on board were held hostage until an Israeli commando raid rescued them ten days later.[57] Amin's reign was ended after the Uganda-Tanzania War in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda.\n\n\n\n### 1979–present[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Uganda (1979–present)\n\n![](image)Belligerents of the Second Congo War. On 19 December 2005, the International Court of Justice found against Uganda, in a case brought by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for illegal invasion of its territory, and violation of human rights.[58]\nIn 1980, the Ugandan Bush War broke out resulting in Yoweri Museveni became president since his forces toppled the previous regime in January 1986.[59]\n\n\nPolitical parties in Uganda were restricted in their activities beginning that year, in a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence. In the non-party \"Movement\" system instituted by Museveni, political parties continued to exist, but they could operate only a headquarters office. They could not open branches, hold rallies, or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this nineteen-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.\n\n\nIn 1993, Pope John Paul II visited Uganda during his 6-day pastoral trip to urge Ugandans to seek reconciliation. During mass celebrations, he paid homage to the slain Christian martyrs.\n\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Museveni was lauded by western countries as part of a new generation of African leaders.[60]\n\n\nHis presidency has been marred, however, by invading and occupying the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War, resulting in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998, and by participating in other conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa. He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord's Resistance Army, which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity, including child slavery, the Atiak massacre, and other mass murders. Conflict in northern Uganda has killed thousands and displaced millions.[61]\n\n\nParliament abolished presidential term limits in 2005, allegedly because Museveni used public funds to pay US$2,000 to each member of parliament who supported the measure.[62] Presidential elections were held in February 2006. Museveni ran against several candidates, the most prominent of them being Kizza Besigye.\n\n\nOn 20 February 2011, the Uganda Electoral Commission declared the incumbent president Yoweri Kaguta Museveni the winning candidate of the 2011 elections that were held on 18 February 2011. The opposition however, were not satisfied with the results, condemning them as full of sham and rigging. According to the official results, Museveni won with 68 percent of the votes. This easily topped his nearest challenger, Besigye, who had been Museveni's physician and told reporters that he and his supporters \"downrightly snub\" the outcome as well as the unremitting rule of Museveni or any person he may appoint. Besigye added that the rigged elections would definitely lead to an illegitimate leadership and that it is up to Ugandans to critically analyse this. The European Union's Election Observation Mission reported on improvements and flaws of the Ugandan electoral process: \"The electoral campaign and polling day were conducted in a peaceful manner. However, the electoral process was marred by avoidable administrative and logistical failures that led to an unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens being disfranchised.\"[63]\n\n\nSince August 2012, hacktivist group Anonymous has threatened Ugandan officials and hacked official government websites over its anti-gay bills.[64] Some international donors have threatened to cut financial aid to the country if anti-gay bills continue.[65]\n\n\nIndicators of a plan for succession by the president's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, have increased tensions.[66][67][68][69]\n\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni has ruled the country since 1986 and he was latest re-elected in January 2021 presidential elections.[70] According to official results Museveni won the elections with 58% of the vote while popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine had 35%. The opposition challenged the result because of allegations of widespread fraud and irregularities.[71][72] Another opposition candidate was 24 year old John Katumba.[73]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Uganda and Wildlife of Uganda\n\nUganda is located in southeast Africa between 1º S and 4º N latitude, and between 30º E and 35º E longitude. Its geography is very diverse, consisting of volcanic hills, mountains, and lakes. The country sits at an average of 900 meters above sea level. Both the eastern and western borders of Uganda have mountains. The Ruwenzori mountain range contains the highest peak in Uganda, which is named Alexandra and measures 5,094 meters.\n\n\n\n### Lakes and rivers[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the south of the country is heavily influenced by one of the world's biggest lakes, Lake Victoria, which contains many islands. The most important cities are located in the south, near this lake, including the capital Kampala[74][75][76] and the nearby city of Entebbe.[77] Lake Kyoga is in the centre of the country and is surrounded by extensive marshy areas.[78]\n\n\nAlthough landlocked, Uganda contains many large lakes. Besides Lakes Victoria and Kyoga, there are Lake Albert, Lake Edward, and the smaller Lake George.[77] It lies almost completely within the Nile basin. The Victoria Nile drains from Lake Victoria into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border. It then runs northwards into South Sudan. An area in eastern Uganda is drained by the Suam River, part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana. The extreme north-eastern part of Uganda drains into the Lotikipi Basin, which is primarily in Kenya.[77]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Conservation in Uganda\n\n![](image)Uganda map of Köppen climate classification.\nUganda has 60 protected areas, including ten national parks: Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park (both UNESCO World Heritage Sites[79]), Kibale National Park, Kidepo Valley National Park, Lake Mburo National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Semuliki National Park.\n\n\nUganda is home to a vast number of species, including a population of mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, gorillas and golden monkeys in the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, and hippos in the Murchison Falls National Park.[80]\nJackfruit can also be found throughout the country.[81]\n\n\nThe country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.36/10, ranking it 128th globally out of 172 countries.[82]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Uganda\nThe President of Uganda is both head of state and head of government. The president appoints a vice-president and a prime minister to aid him in governing.\n\n\nThe parliament is formed by the National Assembly, which has 449 members. These include 290 constituency representatives, 116 district woman representatives, 10 representatives of the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces, 5 representatives of the youth, 5 representatives of workers, 5 representatives of persons with disabilities, and 18 ex officio members.[83]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Foreign relations of Uganda\nUganda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), along with Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. According to the East African Common Market Protocol of 2010, the free trade and free movement of people is guaranteed, including the right to reside in another member country for purposes of employment. This protocol, however, has not been implemented because of work permit and other bureaucratic, legal, and financial obstacles. Uganda is a founding member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country bloc including governments from the Horn of Africa, Nile Valley, and the African Great Lakes.[84] Its headquarters are in Djibouti City. Uganda is also a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.[85] \n\n![](image)U.S. President George W. Bush met with President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe, Uganda, 11 July 2003.\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Uganda People's Defence Force\n\nIn Uganda, the Uganda People's Defence Force serves as the military. The number of military personnel in Uganda is estimated at 45,000 soldiers on active duty. The Uganda army is involved in several peacekeeping and combat missions in the region, with commentators noting that only the United States Armed Forces is deployed in more countries. Uganda has soldiers deployed in the northern and eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan.[86]\n\n\n\n### Corruption[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Corruption in Uganda\n\nTransparency International has rated Uganda's public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world. In 2016, Uganda ranked 151st best out of 176 and had a score of 25 on a scale from 0 (perceived as most corrupt) to 100 (perceived as clean).[87]\n\n\nThe World Bank's 2015 Worldwide Governance Indicators ranked Uganda in the worst 12 percentile of all countries.[88] According to the United States Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report on Uganda, \"The World Bank's most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected corruption was a severe problem\" and that \"the country annually loses 768.9 billion shillings ($286 million) to corruption.\"[68]\n\n\nUgandan parliamentarians in 2014 earned 60 times what was earned by most state employees, and they sought a major increase. This caused widespread criticism and protests, including the smuggling of two piglets into the parliament in June 2014 to highlight corruption amongst members of parliament. The protesters, who were arrested, used the word \"MPigs\" to highlight their grievance.[89]\n\n\nA specific scandal, which had significant international consequences and highlighted the presence of corruption in high-level government offices, was the embezzlement of $12.6 million of donor funds from the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012. These funds were \"earmarked as crucial support for rebuilding northern Uganda, ravaged by a 20-year war, and Karamoja, Uganda's poorest region.\" This scandal prompted the EU, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway to suspend aid.[90]\n\n\nWidespread grand and petty corruption involving public officials and political patronage systems have also seriously affected the investment climate in Uganda. One of the high corruption risk areas is the public procurement in which non-transparent under-the-table cash payments are often demanded from procurement officers.[91]\n\n\nWhat may ultimately compound this problem is the availability of oil. The Petroleum Bill, passed by parliament in 2012 and touted by the NRM as bringing transparency to the oil sector, has failed to please domestic and international political commentators and economists. For instance, Angelo Izama, a Ugandan energy analyst at the US-based Open Society Foundation said the new law was tantamount to \"handing over an ATM (cash) machine\" to Museveni and his regime.[92] According to Global Witness in 2012, a non-governmental organisation devoted to international law, Uganda now has \"oil reserves that have the potential to double the government's revenue within six to ten years, worth an estimated US $2.4 billion per year.\"[93]\n\n\nThe Non-Governmental Organizations (Amendment) Act, passed in 2006, has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry, activity, funding and assembly within the sector. Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures (i.e. requiring recommendations from government officials; annual re-registration), unreasonable regulation of operations (i.e. requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO's area of interest), and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda, among other things, are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector. Furthermore, the sector's freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation, and the recent Public Order Management Bill (severely limiting freedom of assembly) will only add to the government's stockpile of ammunition.[94]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Uganda\n\nThere are many areas which continue to attract concern when it comes to human rights in Uganda.\n\n\nConflict in the northern parts of the country continues to generate reports of abuses by both the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, and the Ugandan Army. A UN official accused the LRA in February 2009 of \"appalling brutality\" in the Democratic Republic of Congo.[95]\n\n\nThe number of internally displaced persons is estimated at 1.4 million. Torture continues to be a widespread practice amongst security organisations. Attacks on political freedom in the country, including the arrest and beating of opposition members of parliament, have led to international criticism, culminating in May 2005 in a decision by the British government to withhold part of its aid to the country. The arrest of the main opposition leader Kizza Besigye and the siege of the High Court during a hearing of Besigye's case by heavily armed security forces – before the February 2006 elections – led to condemnation.[96]\n\n\nChild labour is common in Uganda. Many child workers are active in agriculture.[97] Children who work on tobacco farms in Uganda are exposed to health hazards.[97] Child domestic servants in Uganda risk sexual abuse.[97] Trafficking of children occurs.[97] Slavery and forced labour are prohibited by the Ugandan constitution.[97]\n\n\nThe US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported several violations of refugee rights in 2007, including forcible deportations by the Ugandan government and violence directed against refugees.[98]\n\n\nTorture and extrajudicial killings have been a pervasive problem in Uganda in recent years. For instance, according to a 2012 US State Department report, \"the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation for Torture Victims registered 170 allegations of torture against police, 214 against the UPDF, 1 against military police, 23 against the Special Investigations Unit, 361 against unspecified security personnel, and 24 against prison officials\" between January and September 2012.[68]\n\n\nIn September 2009, Museveni refused Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi, the Baganda king, permission to visit some areas of Buganda Kingdom, particularly the Kayunga district. Riots occurred and over 40 people were killed while others still remain imprisoned. Furthermore, 9 more people were killed during the April 2011 \"Walk to Work\" demonstrations. According to the Humans Rights Watch 2013 World Report on Uganda, the government has failed to investigate the killings associated with both of these events.[99]\n\n\n\n#### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMain article: LGBT rights in Uganda\n\n![](image)A 2009 protest in New York City against Uganda's first Anti-Homosexuality Bill\nIn 2007 a newspaper, the *Red Pepper*, published a list of allegedly gay men, many of whom suffered harassment as a result.[100]\n\n\nOn 9 October 2010, the Ugandan newspaper *Rolling Stone* published a front-page article titled \"100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak\" that listed the names, addresses, and photographs of 100 homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read \"Hang Them.\"[101] The paper also alleged Homosexual recruitment of Ugandan children. The publication attracted international attention and criticism from human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International,[102] No Peace Without Justice[103] and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.[104] According to gay rights activists, many Ugandans have been attacked since the publication.[105] On 27 January 2011, gay rights activist David Kato was murdered.[106]\n\n\nIn 2009, the Ugandan parliament considered an Anti-Homosexuality Bill which would have broadened the criminalisation of homosexuality by introducing the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, or are HIV-positive, and engage in same-sex sexual acts. The bill included provisions for Ugandans who engage in same-sex sexual relations outside of Uganda, asserting that they may be extradited back to Uganda for punishment, and included penalties for individuals, companies, media organisations, or non-governmental organizations that support legal protection for homosexuality or sodomy. On 14 October 2009, MP David Bahati submitted the private member's bill, and was believed to have had widespread support in the Uganda parliament.[107] The hacktivist group Anonymous hacked into Ugandan government websites in protest of the bill.[108] In response to global condemnation the debate of the bill was delayed, but it was eventually passed on 20 December 2013 and President Museveni signed it on 24 February 2014. The death penalty was dropped in the final legislation. The law was widely condemned by the international community. Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden said they would withhold aid. On 28 February 2014 the World Bank said it would postpone a US$90 million loan, while the United States said it was reviewing ties with Uganda.[109] On 1 August 2014, the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the bill invalid as it was not passed with the required quorum.[110][111][112] A 13 August 2014 news report said that the Ugandan attorney general had dropped all plans to appeal, per a directive from President Museveni who was concerned about foreign reaction to the bill and who also said that any newly introduced bill should not criminalise same-sex relationships between consenting adults.[113] As of 2019 progress on the African continent was slow but progressing with South Africa being the only country where same sex marriages are recognised.[114]\n\n\n\n##### Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2023[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2023\n\nOn 21 March 2023, the Ugandan parliament passed a bill that would make identifying as homosexual punishable by life in prison and the death penalty for anyone found guilty of \"aggravated homosexuality.\"[115][116]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

But it is also true that there are human wrongs. I want to submit that homosexuality is a human wrong that offends the laws of Uganda and threatens the sanctity of the family, the safety of our children and the continuation of humanity through reproduction.\"[117] The speaker of parliament, Annet Anita Among, referred the bill to a house committee for scrutiny, the first step in an accelerated process to pass the proposal into law. The parliament speaker had earlier noted that: \"We want to appreciate our promoters of homosexuality for the social economic development they have brought to the country,\" in reference to western countries and donors. \"But we do not appreciate the fact that they are killing morals. We do not need their money, we need our culture.\" during a prayer service held in parliament and attended by several religious leaders.[118] The Speaker vowed to pass the bill into law at whatever cost to shield Uganda's culture and its sovereignty.[119]\n\n\nOn March 21, 2023 parliament rapidly passed the anti-homosexuality bill with overwhelming support.[120]\n\n\nThe United States strongly condemned the bill. During a White House Press briefing on March 22, 2023, Karine Jean-Pierre stated. \"Human rights are universal. No one should be attacked, imprisoned, or killed simply because of who they are or whom they love.\"[121] In the following days, further criticism came from the United Kingdom,[122] Canada,[123] Germany,[124] and the European Union.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Uganda\n\nAs of 2022[update], Uganda is divided into four Regions of Uganda and 136 districts.[125][126] Rural areas of districts are subdivided into sub-counties, parishes, and villages. Municipal and town councils are designated in urban areas of districts.[127]\n\n\nPolitical subdivisions in Uganda are officially served and united by the Uganda Local Governments Association (ULGA), a voluntary and non-profit body which also serves as a forum for support and guidance for Ugandan sub-national governments.[128]\n\n\nParallel with the state administration, five traditional Bantu kingdoms have remained, enjoying some degrees of mainly cultural autonomy. The kingdoms are Toro, Busoga, Bunyoro, Buganda, and Rwenzururu. Furthermore, some groups attempt to restore Ankole as one of the officially recognised traditional kingdoms, to no avail yet.[129] Several other kingdoms and chiefdoms are officially recognised by the government, including the union of Alur chiefdoms, the Iteso paramount chieftaincy, the paramount chieftaincy of Lango and the Padhola state.[130]\n\n\n\n## Economy and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Uganda, Energy in Uganda, and Agriculture in Uganda\n\n![](image)2012 Graphical depiction of Uganda's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.\nThe Bank of Uganda is the central bank of Uganda and handles monetary policy along with the printing of the Ugandan shilling.[131]\n\n\nIn 2015, Uganda's economy generated export income from the following merchandise: coffee (US$402.63 million), oil re-exports (US$131.25 million), base metals and products (US$120.00 million), fish (US$117.56 million), maize (US$90.97 million), cement (US$80.13 million), tobacco (US$73.13 million), tea (US$69.94 million), sugar (US$66.43 million), hides and skins (US$62.71 million), cocoa beans (US$55.67 million), beans (US$53.88 million), simsim (US$52.20 million), flowers (US$51.44 million), and other products (US$766.77 million).[132]\n\n\n\n![](image)Change in per capita GDP of Uganda, 1950–2018. Figures are inflation-adjusted to 2011 International dollars.\nThe country has been experiencing consistent economic growth. In fiscal year 2015–16, Uganda recorded gross domestic product growth of 4.6 percent in real terms and 11.6 percent in nominal terms. This compares to 5.0 percent real growth in fiscal year 2014–15.[133]: vii\n\n\nThe country has largely untapped reserves of both crude oil and natural gas.[134] While agriculture accounted for 56 percent of the economy in 1986, with coffee as its main export, it has now been surpassed by the services sector, which accounted for 52 percent of GDP in 2007.[135] In the 1950s, the British colonial regime encouraged some 500,000 subsistence farmers to join co-operatives.[136] Since 1986, the government (with the support of foreign countries and international agencies) has acted to rehabilitate an economy devastated during the regime of Idi Amin[137] and the subsequent civil war.[138]\n\n\nIn 2012, the World Bank still listed Uganda on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries list.[139]\n\n\nEconomic growth has not always led to poverty reduction. Despite an average annual growth of 2.5 percent between 2000 and 2003, poverty levels increased by 3.8 percent during that time.[140] This has highlighted the importance of avoiding jobless growth and is part of the rising awareness in development circles of the need for equitable growth not just in Uganda, but across the developing world.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Coffee fields in southwestern Uganda\nWith the Uganda securities exchanges established in 1996, several equities have been listed. The government has used the stock market as an avenue for privatisation. All government treasury issues are listed on the securities exchange. The Capital Markets Authority has licensed 18 brokers, asset managers, and investment advisors including: African Alliance Investment Bank, Baroda Capital Markets Uganda Limited, Crane Financial Services Uganda Limited, Crested Stocks and Securities Limited, Dyer & Blair Investment Bank, Equity Stock Brokers Uganda Limited, Renaissance Capital Investment Bank and UAP Financial Services Limited.[141] As one of the ways of increasing formal domestic savings, pension sector reform is the centre of attention (2007).[142][143]\n\n\nUganda traditionally depends on Kenya for access to the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa. Efforts have intensified to establish a second access route to the sea via the lakeside ports of Bukasa in Uganda and Musoma in Tanzania, connected by railway to Arusha in the Tanzanian interior and to the port of Tanga on the Indian Ocean.[144]\nUganda is a member of the East African Community and a potential member of the planned East African Federation.\n\n\nUganda has a large diaspora, residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda's economic growth through remittances and other investments (especially property). According to the World Bank, Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US$1.099 billion in remittances from abroad, second only to Kenya (US$1.574 billion) in the East African Community,[145] and seventh in Africa.[146] Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[147] South Sudan,[148] and Rwanda.[149]\n\n\nThe Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 percent in November 2016.[150] On 29 June 2018, Uganda's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 percent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 percent recorded in the financial year 2016/17.[151]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nUganda ranked as number 102 among the countries of the world in nominal Gross Domestic Product by the International Monetary Fund with a GDP of 26,349 (US$million).[152] The World Bank ranked Uganda as number 99 in nominal GDP with a GDP of 25,891 (US$million).[153]\nBased on the GDP with purchasing power parity the IMF ranked Uganda as number 86 (91,212 million of current Int$) and the World Bank ranked them 90 (79,889 million of current Int$).[152][153]\n\n\nSince the 1990s, the economy in Uganda is growing. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 6.7% annually during the period 1990–2015, whereas real GDP per capita grew at 3.3% per annum during the same period.[154]\n\n\n\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Poverty in Uganda\n\nUganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. In 2012, 37.8 percent of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day.[155] Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 percent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 percent in 2009, poverty remains deep-rooted in the country's rural areas, which are home to 84 percent of Ugandans.[156]\n\n\nPeople in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector.[157] In addition to agricultural work, rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families. The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks, such as preparing food and clothing, fetching water and firewood, and caring for the elderly, the sick as well as orphans. As such, women on average work longer hours than men, between 12 and 18 hours per day, with a mean of 15 hours, as compared to men, who work between 8 and 10 hours a day.[158]\n\n\nTo supplement their income, rural women may engage in small-scale entrepreneurial activities such as rearing and selling local breeds of animals. Nonetheless, because of their heavy workload, they have little time for these income-generating activities. The poor cannot support their children at school and in most cases, girls drop out of school to help out in domestic work or to get married. Other girls engage in sex work. As a result, young women tend to have older and more sexually experienced partners and this puts women at a disproportionate risk of getting affected by HIV, accounting for about 5.7 per cent of all adults living with HIV in Uganda.[159]\n\n\nMaternal health in rural Uganda lags behind national policy targets and the Millennium Development Goals, with geographical inaccessibility, lack of transport and financial burdens identified as key demand-side constraints to accessing maternal health services;[160] as such, interventions like intermediate transport mechanisms have been adopted as a means to improve women's access to maternal health care services in rural regions of the country.[161]\n\n\nGender inequality is the main hindrance to reducing women's poverty. Women are subjected to an overall lower social status than men. Many women believe this reduces their power to act independently, participate in community life, become educated and escape reliance upon abusive men.[162]\n\n\n\n![](image)Entebbe International Airport\n### Air transportation[edit]\n\n\nThere are 35 airports in Uganda. Commercial airlines operate scheduled passenger services out of four airports. Uganda currently has one functioning international airport, Entebbe International Airport, which is located 25 miles (40 km) south-west of Kampala. In 2017, the airport traffic hit 1.53 million passengers, 8% more than the previous year.[163] A second international airport, Hoima International Airport, is currently under construction.[164]\n\n\n\n### Road network[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of roads in Uganda\n\n![](image)Road to Murchison\nRoad transportation is the most important way of transportation in Uganda. 95% of freight and passenger traffic is handled by road traffic. The road network in Uganda is approximately 129,469 km (80,448 mi) long. About 4% of these roads are paved which equates to only about 5,300 kilometres (3,300 mi) of paved road. The different types of roads are national roads (22,009 km (13,676 mi)—17%), district roads (33,661 km (20,916 mi)—26%), urban roads (9,062 km (5,631 mi)—7%), and community roads (64,734 km (40,224 mi)—50%).[165] The national roads make up about 17% of the road network but carry over 80% of the total road traffic.[166] In Uganda there are 83,000 private cars which means 2.94 cars per 1000 inhabitants.[167]\n\n\n\n### Railroad[edit]\n\n\nThe rail network in Uganda is approximately 1,260 kilometres (780 mi) long. The longest lines are the main line from Kampala to Tororo (249 kilometres (155 mi)), the western line from Kampala to Kasese (333 kilometres (207 mi)), the northern line from Tororo to Pakwach (641 kilometres (398 mi)).[168]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Communications in Uganda\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

These include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, peat and fossil fuels.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood. However, oil was found in the Lake Albert area, totaling an estimated 95 million cubic metres (3.4×10~~^~~9 cu ft) of crude.[134] Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda, and continues operations there.[172]\n\n\nUganda and Tanzania signed a deal on 13 September 2016 that will see the two countries build a 1,445 km, $3.5bn crude oil pipeline. The Uganda–Tanzania Crude Oil Pipeline (UTCOP), also known as the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) will be the first of its kind in East Africa, will connect Uganda's oil-rich Hoima region with the Indian Ocean through the Tanga port in Tanzania.\n\n\nUganda's favorable enabling environment and broad presence of private sector investment presents a unique opportunity to deliver on Power Africa goals.[173] Uganda is one of the few sub-Saharan African countries to have liberalized and financially viable energy markets, with generation, transmission and supply segments unbundled since 2001.[174] There is an independent Electricity Regulatory Authority that undertakes sector regulation and oversight. The largest distribution company, UMEME is privately owned and has a 20-year concession for distribution and retail. The country, however, is divided into 13 rural service territories, and 6 of these are being managed by small distribution companies. Independent power producers (IPPs) currently account for nearly 60% of generation capacity. Issues with integrated planning and the financial ecosystem persist.\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Uganda\n\nAccording to a 2006 published report, the Ugandan water supply and sanitation sector had made substantial progress in urban areas since the mid-1990s, with substantial increases in coverage as well as in operational and commercial performance.[175]: 3–4 Sector reforms in the period 1998–2003 included the commercialisation and modernisation of the National Water and Sewerage Corporation operating in cities and larger towns, as well as decentralisation and private sector participation in small towns.[176]: 15\n\n\nAlthough these reforms have attracted significant international attention, 38 percent of the population still had no access to an improved water source in 2010. Concerning access to improved sanitation, figures have varied widely. According to government figures, it was 70 percent in rural areas and 81 percent in urban areas in 2011,[177] while according to UN figures it was only 34 percent.[178]\n\n\nThe water and sanitation sector was recognised as a key area under the 2004 Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), Uganda's\nmain strategy paper to fight poverty.[179]: 182–188 According to a 2006 published report, a comprehensive expenditure framework had been introduced to co-ordinate financial support by external donors, the national government, and nongovernmental organisations.[180]: 5 The PEAP estimated that from 2001 to 2015, about US$1.4 billion, or US$92 million per year, was needed to increase water supply coverage up to 95 percent, with rural areas needing US$956 million, urban areas and large towns needing US$281 million, and small towns needing US$136 million.[179]: 182–183\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Uganda\nUganda's educational system, while lacking in many areas, has seen significant change since the late 1990s. The educational system is set up so that children spend seven years in primary school, six years in secondary school, and three to five years in post secondary school. In 1997, the government declared that primary school would be free for all children.[181] This amendment has had huge benefits. In 1986, only two million children were attending primary school. By 1999, six million children were attending primary school, and this number has continued to climb.\nFollowing significant gains in access to primary education since 1997 when universal primary education (UPE) was introduced, Uganda in 2007 became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education (USE).[182] This bold step by the Government of Uganda led to an increase in lower secondary enrolment of nearly 25% between 2007 and 2012.\n\n![](image)Students in Uganda\nAt the 2002 census, Uganda had a literacy rate of 66.8 percent (76.8 percent male and 57.7 percent female).[138] Public spending on education was at 5.2 percent of the 2002–2005 GDP.[183]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the NCHE website listed 46 private accredited universities.[184] to mention a few, Makerere University, Mbarara University of science and technology, Kyambogo University, Gulu University, Uganda Christian University, Kampala international University among many more.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Uganda and HIV/AIDS in Uganda\n\nThere were eight physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s.[183] Uganda's elimination of user fees at state health facilities in 2001 has resulted in an 80 percent increase in visits, with over half of this increase coming from the poorest 20 percent of the population.[185] This policy has been cited as a key factor in helping Uganda achieve its Millennium Development Goals and as an example of the importance of equity in achieving those goals.[140] Despite this policy, many users are denied care if they do not provide their own medical equipment, as happened in the highly publicised case of Jennifer Anguko.[186] Poor communication within hospitals,[187] low satisfaction with health services[188] and distance to health service providers undermine the provision of quality health care to people living in Uganda, and particularly for those in poor and elderly-headed households.[189] The provision of subsidies for poor and rural populations, along with the extension of public private partnerships, have been identified as important provisions to enable vulnerable populations to access health services.[189]\n\n\n\n![](image)Development of life expectancy\nLife expectancy at birth was estimated to be 63.4 years in 2019.[190] The infant mortality rate was approximately 61 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012.[191]\n\n\nIn July 2012, there was an Ebola outbreak in the Kibaale District of the country.[192] On 4 October 2012, the Ministry of Health officially declared the end of the outbreak after at least 16 people had died.[193]\n\n\nThe Health Ministry announced on 16 August 2013 that three people had died in northern Uganda from a suspected outbreak of Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever.[194]\n\n\nUganda has been among the rare HIV success stories.[183] Infection rates of 30 percent of the population in the 1980s fell to 6.4 percent by the end of 2008.[195][196] Meanwhile, the practice of abstinence was found to have decreased.[197]\n\n\nLess than half of all sexually active unmarried women use a modern contraceptive method, a fraction that has barely changed from 2000 to 2011. However, only ~26% of married women used contraceptives in 2011. The use of contraceptives also differs substantially between poor (~15%) and wealthy women (~40%).[198] As a result, Ugandan women have ~6 children while they prefer to have around ~4. According to the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), more than 40% of births are unplanned. In 2010, the Ugandan Ministry of Health estimated that unsafe abortion accounted for 8% of the country's maternal deaths.[198] The 2006 Uganda Demographic Health Survey (UDHS) indicated that roughly 6,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related complications.[199] Pilot studies in 2012 by Future Health Systems have shown that this rate could be significantly reduced by implementing a voucher scheme for health services and transport to clinics.[200][201]\n\n\nThe prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) is low: according to a 2013 UNICEF report,[202] only 1 percent of women in Uganda have undergone FGM, with the practice being illegal in the country.[203]\n\n\n\n### Crime and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

These rebels are an enemy of the Uganda People's Defence Force and are considered an affiliate of Al-Shabaab.[204]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Uganda\n\n![](image)Rwenzori mountains in Uganda\n![](image)Forest Landscape Integrity Index 2019 map of Uganda. Forest condition measured by degree of anthropogenic modification. 0 = Most modification; 10= Least. Created in Google Earth Engine. National boundaries = LSIB 2017: Large Scale International Boundary Polygons, Detailed, US Officer of the Geographer\nTourism in Uganda is focused on Uganda's landscape and wildlife. It is a major driver of employment, investment and foreign exchange, contributing 4.9 trillion Ugandan shillings (US$1.88 billion or €1.4 billion as of August 2013) to Uganda's GDP in the financial year 2012–13.[205] The Uganda Tourism Board is responsible for maintaining information pertaining to tourism in Uganda. The main attractions are photo safaris through the National parks and game Reserves. Other attractions include the Mountain Gorillas found in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP) and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP), Uganda having some of the oldest cultural kingdom in Africa has many Cultural sites. Uganda is a birding paradise boasting a massive bird list of more than 1073 recorded bird species ranking 4th in Africa's bird species and 16th internationally.[206] Uganda has landscapes ranging from white-capped Rwenzori mountains to the Great Rift Valley.\n\n\n\n## Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nThe *National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy* dates from 2009. Its overarching goal is to 'strengthen national capability to generate, transfer and apply scientific knowledge, skills and technologies that ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources for the realisation of Uganda's development objectives.' The policy precedes Uganda Vision 2040, which was launched in April 2013 to transform 'Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years,' in the words of the Cabinet. Uganda Vision 2040 vows to strengthen the private sector, improve education and training, modernize infrastructure and the underdeveloped services and agriculture sectors, foster industrialization and promote good governance, among other goals. Potential areas for economic development include oil and gas, tourism, minerals and information and communication technologies (ICTs).[207]\n\n\nUganda was ranked 121st in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, down from 102nd in 2019.[208][209][210] Research funding climbed between 2008 and 2010 from 0.33% to 0.48% of GDP. Over the same period, the number of researchers doubled (in head counts) from 1 387 to 2 823, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This represents a leap from 44 to 83 researchers per million inhabitants over the same period. One in four researchers is a woman.\nUganda has been able to manufacture prototype of cars called kiira in which the government invested US$70.[207]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Uganda\n\n![](image)Population density of Uganda districts\nUganda's population grew from 9.5 million people in 1969 to 34.9 million in 2014. With respect to the last inter-censal period (September 2002), the population increased by 10.6 million people in the past 12 years.[211] Uganda's median age of 15 years is the lowest in the world.[138] Uganda has the fifth highest total fertility rate in the world, at 5.97 children born per woman (2014 estimates).[138]\n\n\nThere were about 80,000 Indians in Uganda before Idi Amin required the expulsion of Ugandan-Asians (mostly of Indian origin) in 1972, which reduced the population to as low as 7,000. Many Indians, however, returned to Uganda after Amin's ouster in 1979. Around 90 percent of Ugandan Indians reside in Kampala.[212]\n\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, Uganda hosts over 1.4 million refugees on its soil as of August 2021.[213][214] Most come from neighbouring countries in the African Great Lakes region, particularly South Sudan (68.0 percent) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (24.6%).[214] In August 2021, Uganda received some refugees from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover.[213]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Uganda\n\n![](image)An ethnolinguistic map of Uganda\nSwahili, a widely used language throughout the African Great Lakes region, was approved as the country's second official national language in 2005.[215][216] English was the only official language until the constitution was amended in 2005.[217][138][215][1][218] Although Swahili has not been favoured by the Bantu-speaking populations of the south and south-west of the country, it is an important *lingua franca* in the northern regions. It is also widely used in the police and military forces, which may be a historical result of the disproportionate recruitment of northerners into the security forces during the colonial period. The status of Swahili has thus alternated with the political group in power.[219] For example, Idi Amin, who came from the north-west, declared Swahili to be the national language.[220]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Uganda\n\n![](image)Saint Mary's Cathedral Rubaga, is the parent cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala.\nThe Roman Catholic Church had the largest number of adherents (39.3 percent, down from 41.6 in 2002), followed by the Anglican Church of Uganda (32 percent, down from 35.9 percent). The category of Evangelical/Pentecostal/Born-Again showed the most growth, rising from 4.7% in 2002 to 11.1% in 2018. Adventist and other Protestant churches claimed most of the remaining Christians, although there was also a small Eastern Orthodox community.[221][222] The next most reported religion of Uganda was Islam, with Muslims representing 13.7 percent of the population, up from 12.1% in 2002.[221]\n\n\nThe remainder of the population according to the 2014 census followed traditional religions (0.1 percent, down from 1% in 2002), other religions (1.4 percent), or had no religious affiliation (0.2 percent).[221]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities and towns[edit]\n\n\n\n|  Largest urban centres in UgandaUganda Bureau of Statistics 2016, *National Population and Housing Census 2014 – Main Report*, p. 11\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Name | District | Municipal pop.\n |\n| 1 | Kampala | Kampala | 1,507,114\n |\n| 2 | Nansana | Wakiso | 365,857\n |\n| 3 | Kira | Wakiso | 317,428\n |\n| 4 | Makindye Ssabagabo | Wakiso | 282,664\n |\n| 5 | Mbarara | Mbarara | 195,160\n |\n| 6 | Mukono | Mukono | 162,744\n |\n| 7 | Gulu | Gulu | 149,802\n |\n| 8 | Lugazi | Buikwe | 114,163\n |\n| 9 | Kasese | Kasese | 103,293\n |\n| 10 | Masaka | Masaka | 101,557\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Uganda, Music of Uganda, Ugandan cuisine, List of African writers (by country) § Uganda, and List of Ugandans\n\n![](image)Cultural celebrations in Northern Uganda\n![](image)Woman in Rwenzori – Western Uganda\nOwing to the large number of communities, culture within Uganda is diverse.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2020)*\n |\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Uganda\n\nThe Ugandan film industry is relatively young. It is developing quickly, but still faces an assortment of challenges. There has been support for the industry as seen in the proliferation of film festivals such as Amakula, Pearl International Film Festival, Maisha African Film Festival and Manya Human Rights Festival. However, filmmakers struggle against the competing markets from other countries on the continent such as those in Nigeria and South Africa in addition to the big budget films from Hollywood.[232]\n\n\nThe first publicly recognised film that was produced solely by Ugandans was *Feelings Struggle*, which was directed and written by Hajji Ashraf Ssemwogerere in 2005.[233] This marks the year of ascent of film in Uganda, a time where many enthusiasts were proud to classify themselves as cinematographers in varied capacities.[234]\n\n\nThe local film industry is polarised between two types of filmmakers. The first are filmmakers who use the Nollywood video film era's guerrilla approach to film making, churning out a picture in around two weeks and screening it in makeshift video halls. The second is the filmmaker who has the film aesthetic, but with limited funds has to depend on the competitive scramble for donor cash.[232]\n\n\nThough cinema in Uganda is evolving, it still faces major challenges. Along with technical problems such as refining acting and editing skills, there are issues regarding funding and lack of government support and investment. There are no schools in the country dedicated to film, banks do not extend credit to film ventures, and distribution and marketing of movies remains poor.[232][234]\n\n\nThe Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) is preparing regulations starting in 2014 that require Ugandan television to broadcast 70 percent Ugandan content and of this, 40 percent to be independent productions. With the emphasis on Ugandan film and the UCC regulations favouring Ugandan productions for mainstream television, Ugandan film may become more prominent and successful in the near future.[234]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Uganda portal\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n\n\n* Index of Uganda-related articles\n* Outline of Uganda\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Article 4(a) of the Constitution requires the state to promote public awareness through translating it into Ugandan languages and disseminating it as widely as possible[5]\n2. **^** Yuganda in Ugandan languages\n3. **^** Swahili: *Jamhuri ya Uganda*\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Uganda Constitution\" (PDF). *The State House of Uganda*.

Its rich cultural heritage[15]—including language, religion, cuisine, and art—reflects its history as a colony, fusing cultural elements brought by  mass immigration from Europe[16][17][18][19] and the Middle East,[20][21][22] with those brought by the African diaspora,[23] as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization.[24] Spanish is the official language, although English and 64 other languages are recognized regionally.\n\n\nColombia has been home to many indigenous peoples and cultures since at least 12,000 BCE. The Spanish first landed in La Guajira in 1499, and by the mid-16th century they had colonized much of present-day Colombia, and established the New Kingdom of Granada, with Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. Independence from the Spanish Empire was achieved in 1819, with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada. The new polity experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858) and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before becoming a republic—the current Republic of Colombia—in 1886. With the backing of the United States and France, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, resulting in Colombia's present borders. Beginning in the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s. Since 2005, there has been significant improvement in security, stability and rule of law, as well as unprecedented economic growth and development.[25][26] Colombia is recognized for its healthcare system, being the best healthcare in Latin America according to the World Health Organization and 22nd in the world.[27][28]\n\n\nColombia is one of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries; it has the highest level of biodiversity per square mile in the world and the second-highest level overall.[29] Its territory encompasses Amazon rainforest, highlands, grasslands and deserts. It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner.[30] Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.[31][32]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"Colombia\" is derived from the last name of the Italian navigator Christopher Columbus (Latin: *Christophorus Columbus*, Italian: *Cristoforo Colombo*, Spanish: *Cristóbal Colón*). It was conceived as a reference to all of the New World.[33] The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of 1819, formed from the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).[34]\n\n\nWhen Venezuela, Ecuador, and Cundinamarca came to exist as independent states, the former Department of Cundinamarca adopted the name \"Republic of New Granada\". New Granada officially changed its name in 1858 to the Granadine Confederation. In 1863 the name was again changed, this time to United States of Colombia, before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in 1886.[34]\n\n\nTo refer to this country, the Colombian government uses the terms *Colombia* and *República de Colombia*.[35]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Colombia and Timeline of Colombian history\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia\n\n![](image)Location map of the pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia\nOwing to its location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human civilization from Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to the Andes and Amazon basin. The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley 100 kilometers (62 mi) southwest of Bogotá.[36] These sites date from the Paleoindian period (18,000–8000 BCE). At Puerto Hormiga and other sites, traces from the Archaic Period (~8000–2000 BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of El Abra and Tequendama in Cundinamarca. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found at San Jacinto, dates to 5000–4000 BCE.[37]\n\n\nIndigenous people inhabited the territory that is now Colombia by 12,500 BCE. Nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes at the El Abra, Tibitó and Tequendama sites near present-day Bogotá traded with one another and with other cultures from the Magdalena River Valley.[38] A site including eight miles (13 km) of pictographs that is under study at Serranía de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020.[39] Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old (c. 10,480 B.C.) by the anthropologists working on the site because of extinct fauna depicted. That would have been during the earliest known human occupation of the area now known as Colombia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBetween 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of Amerindians including the Muisca, Zenú, Quimbaya, and Tairona developed the political system of *cacicazgos* with a pyramidal structure of power headed by *caciques*. The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the Departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca high plateau (*Altiplano Cundiboyacense*) where they formed the Muisca Confederation. They farmed maize, potato, quinoa, and cotton, and traded gold, emeralds, blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and especially rock salt with neighboring nations. The Tairona inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated mountain range of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.[40] The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the Cauca River Valley between the Western and Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes.[41] Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different. Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war, but others had less bellicose attitudes.[42]\n\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: New Kingdom of Granada and Viceroyalty of New Granada\n\nSee also: Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations, Spanish conquest of the Muisca, Spanish colonization of the Americas, and Spanish Empire\n\n![](image)Vasco Núñez de Balboa, founder of Santa María la Antigua del Darién the first stable European settlement on the continent\nAlonso de Ojeda (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1499.[43][44] Spanish explorers, led by Rodrigo de Bastidas, made the first exploration of the Caribbean coast in 1500.[45] Christopher Columbus navigated near the Caribbean in 1502.[46] In 1508, Vasco Núñez de Balboa accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of Gulf of Urabá and they founded the town of Santa María la Antigua del Darién in 1510, the first stable settlement on the continent. [Note 2][47] Santa Marta was founded in 1525,[48] and Cartagena in 1533.[49] Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in April 1536, and christened the districts through which he passed \"New Kingdom of Granada\". In August 1538, he provisionally founded its capital near the Muisca cacicazgo of Muyquytá, and named it \"Santa Fe\". The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogotá.[50][51] Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period. Sebastián de Belalcázar, conqueror of Quito, traveled north and founded Cali, in 1536, and Popayán, in 1537;[52] from 1536 to 1539, German conquistador Nikolaus Federmann crossed the Llanos Orientales and went over the Cordillera Oriental in a search for El Dorado, the \"city of gold\".[53][54] The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish and other Europeans to New Granada during the 16th and 17th centuries.[55]\n\n\nThe conquistadors made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities. Indigenous allies were crucial to conquest, as well as to creating and maintaining empire.[56] Indigenous peoples in New Granada experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which they had no immunity.[57][58] Regarding the land as deserted, the Spanish Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonized territories, creating large farms and possession of mines.[59][60][61] In the 16th century, the nautical science in Spain reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the Casa de Contratación and nautical science was an essential pillar of the Iberian expansion.[62] In 1542, the region of New Granada, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America, became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, with its capital in Lima.[63] In 1547, New Granada became a separate captaincy-general within the viceroyalty, with its capital at Santa Fe de Bogota.[64] In 1549, the Royal Audiencia was created by a royal decree, and New Granada was ruled by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá, which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta, Rio de San Juan, Popayán, Guayana and Cartagena.[65] But important decisions were taken from the colony to Spain by the Council of the Indies.[66][67]\n\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of the Battle of Cartagena de Indias, a major Spanish victory in the War of Jenkins' Ear[68]\nIn the 16th century, European slave traders had begun to bring enslaved Africans to the Americas. Spain was the only European power that did not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves; the Spanish Empire instead relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants from other European nations the license to trade enslaved peoples to their overseas territories.[69][70] This system brought Africans to Colombia, although many spoke out against the institution.[Note 3][Note 4] The indigenous peoples could not be enslaved because they were legally subjects of the Spanish Crown.[75] To protect the indigenous peoples, several forms of land ownership and regulation were established by the Spanish colonial authorities: *resguardos*, *encomiendas* and *haciendas*.[59][60][61]\n\n\nHowever, secret anti-Spanish discontentment was already brewing for Colombians since Spain prohibited direct trade between the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included Colombia, and the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which included the Philippines, the source of Asian products like silk and porcelain which was in demand in the Americas. Illegal trade between Peruvians, Filipinos, and Mexicans continued in secret, as smuggled Asian goods ended up in Córdoba, Colombia, the distribution center for illegal Asian imports, due to the collusion between these peoples against the authorities in Spain. They settled and traded with each other while disobeying the forced Spanish monopoly.[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mapa of the Viceroyalty of New Granada\nThe Viceroyalty of New Granada was established in 1717, then temporarily removed, and then re-established in 1739. Its capital was Santa Fé de Bogotá. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. So, Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with Lima and Mexico City, though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.[77][78]\n\n\nGreat Britain declared war on Spain in 1739, and the city of Cartagena quickly became a top target for the British. A massive British expeditionary force was dispatched to capture the city, but, after achieving initial inroads, devastating outbreaks of disease crippled their numbers and the British were forced to withdraw. The battle became one of Spain's most decisive victories in the conflict, and secured Spanish dominance in the Caribbean until the Seven Years' War.[68][79] The 18th-century priest, botanist and mathematician José Celestino Mutis was delegated by Viceroy Antonio Caballero y Góngora to conduct an inventory of the nature of New Granada. Started in 1783, this became known as the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada. It classified plants and wildlife, and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá.[80] In July 1801 the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt reached Santa Fe de Bogotá where he met with Mutis. In addition, historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer Francisco José de Caldas, the scientist Francisco Antonio Zea, the zoologist Jorge Tadeo Lozano and the painter Salvador Rizo.[81][82]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Colombian Declaration of Independence, First Republic of New Granada, and Gran Colombia\n\n![](image)Formation of the present Colombia since the Viceroyalty of New Granada's independence from the Spanish Empire\n![](image)The Battle of Boyacá was the decisive battle that ensured success of the liberation campaign of New Granada.\nSince the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements against Spanish rule, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the Colombian Declaration of Independence, issued on 20 July 1810, the day that is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day.[83] This movement followed the independence of St. Domingue (present-day Haiti) in 1804, which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion: Simón Bolívar. Francisco de Paula Santander also would play a decisive role.[84][85][86]\n\n\nA movement was initiated by Antonio Nariño, who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the Viceroyalty.[87] Cartagena became independent in November 1811.[88] In 1811, the United Provinces of New Granada were proclaimed, headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio.[89][90] The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots (federalism and centralism) gave rise to a period of instability.[91] Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended, Ferdinand VII, recently restored to the throne in Spain, unexpectedly decided to send military forces to retake most of northern South America. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan Sámano, whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements, ignoring the political nuances of the juntas.[92] The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819.[93][94] The pro-Spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.[95][96][97]\n\n\nThe territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia, organized as a union of the current territories of Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela, parts of Guyana and Brazil and north of Marañón River.[98] The Congress of Cúcuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic.[99][100] Simón Bolívar became the first President of Colombia, and Francisco de Paula Santander was made Vice President.[101] However, the new republic was unstable and the Gran Colombia ultimately collapsed.\n\n\nModern Colombia comes from one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Gran Colombia, the other two being Ecuador and Venezuela.[102][103][104] Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America,[105] and the Liberal and Conservative parties, founded in 1848 and 1849, respectively, are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas.[106] Slavery was abolished in the country in 1851.[107][108]\n\n\nInternal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830.[102][103] The so-called \"Department of Cundinamarca\" adopted the name \"New Granada\", which it kept until 1858 when it became the \"Confederación Granadina\" (Granadine Confederation). After a two-year civil war in 1863, the \"United States of Colombia\" was created, lasting until 1886, when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia.[105][109] Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the Thousand Days' War (1899–1902).[110]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colombian conflict\n\nThe United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the Panama Canal construction and control)[111] led to the separation of the Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation.[112] The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty.[113] Colombia and Peru went to war because of territory disputes far in the Amazon basin. The war ended with a peace deal brokered by the League of Nations. The League finally awarded the disputed area to Colombia in June 1934.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bogotazo in 1948\nSoon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as *La Violencia* (\"The Violence\"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán on 9 April 1948.[115][116] The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as El Bogotazo, spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.[117]\n\n\nColombia entered the Korean War when Laureano Gómez was elected president. It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States. Particularly important was the resistance of the Colombian troops at Old Baldy.[118]\n\n\nThe violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed the President of Colombia in a coup d'état and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the military junta of General Gabriel París.[119][120]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Axis of Peace and Memory, a memorial to the victims of the Colombian conflict (1964–present)\nAfter Rojas' deposition, the Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the National Front, a coalition that would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.[121] The National Front ended \"La Violencia\", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress.[122][123] Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC, the ELN and the M-19 to fight the government and political apparatus.[124]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict between government forces, leftist guerrilla groups and right wing paramilitaries.[125] The conflict escalated in the 1990s,[126] mainly in remote rural areas.[127] Since the beginning of the armed conflict, human rights defenders have fought for the respect for human rights, despite staggering opposition.[Note 5][Note 6] Several guerrillas' organizations decided to demobilize after peace negotiations in 1989–1994.[25]\n\n\nThe United States has been heavily involved in the conflict since its beginnings, when in the early 1960s the U.S. government encouraged the Colombian military to attack leftist militias in rural Colombia. This was part of the U.S. fight against communism. Mercenaries and multinational corporations such as Chiquita Brands International are some of the international actors that have contributed to the violence of the conflict.[125][25][131]\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s Colombian drug cartels became major producers, processors and exporters of illegal drugs, primarily marijuana and cocaine.[132]\n\n\nOn 4 July 1991, a new Constitution was promulgated. The changes generated by the new constitution are viewed as positive by Colombian society.[133][134]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colombian peace process\n\n![](image)Former President Juan Manuel Santos signed a peace accord\nThe administration of President Álvaro Uribe (2002–2010) adopted the democratic security policy which included an integrated counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency campaign.[135] The government economic plan also promoted confidence in investors.[136] As part of a controversial peace process, the AUC (right-wing paramilitaries) had ceased to function formally as an organization .[137] In February 2008, millions of Colombians demonstrated against FARC and other outlawed groups.[138]\n\n\nAfter peace negotiations in Cuba, the Colombian government of President Juan Manuel Santos and the guerrillas of the FARC-EP announced a final agreement to end the conflict.[139] However, a referendum to ratify the deal was unsuccessful.[140][141] Afterward, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised peace deal in November 2016,[142] which the Colombian congress approved.[143] In 2016, President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[144] The Government began a process of attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict.[145][146] Colombia shows modest progress in the struggle to defend human rights, as expressed by HRW.[147] A Special Jurisdiction of Peace has been created to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict and to satisfy victims' right to justice.[148] During his visit to Colombia, Pope Francis paid tribute to the victims of the conflict.[149]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gustavo Petro, the country's first left-wing president\nIn June 2018, Ivan Duque, the candidate of the right-wing Democratic Center party, won the presidential election.[150] On 7 August 2018, he was sworn in as the new President of Colombia to succeed Juan Manuel Santos.[151] Colombia's relations with Venezuela have fluctuated due to ideological differences between the two governments.[152] Colombia has offered humanitarian support with food and medicines to mitigate the shortage of supplies in Venezuela.[153] Colombia's Foreign Ministry said that all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful.[154] Colombia proposed the idea of the Sustainable Development Goals and a final document was adopted by the United Nations.[155] In February 2019, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with Colombia after Colombian President Ivan Duque had helped Venezuelan opposition politicians deliver humanitarian aid to their country. Colombia recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country's legitimate president. In January 2020, Colombia rejected Maduro's proposal that the two countries restore diplomatic relations.[156]\n\n\nProtests started on 28 April 2021 when the government proposed a tax bill which would greatly expand the range of the 19 percent value-added tax.[157] The 19 June 2022 election run-off vote ended in a win for former guerrilla, Gustavo Petro, taking 50.47% of the vote compared to 47.27% for independent candidate Rodolfo Hernández. The single-term limit for the country's presidency prevented president Iván Duque from seeking re-election. On 7 August 2022, Petro was sworn in, becoming the country's first leftist president.[158][159]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Colombia and Geology of Colombia\n\nFurther information: List of national parks of Colombia and List of rivers in Colombia\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Colombia\nThe geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main natural regions that present their own unique characteristics, from the Andes mountain range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the Pacific Coastal region shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the *Llanos* (plains) shared with Venezuela; the Amazon rainforest region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador; to the insular area, comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[160] It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.[161]\n\n\nColombia is bordered to the northwest by Panama, to the east by Venezuela and Brazil, and to the south by Ecuador and Peru;[162] it established its maritime boundaries with neighboring countries through seven agreements on the Caribbean Sea and three on the Pacific Ocean.[161] It lies between latitudes 12°N and 4°S and between longitudes 67° and 79°W.\n\n\nEast of the Andes lies the savanna of the *Llanos*, part of the Orinoco River basin, and in the far southeast, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest. Together these lowlands make up over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast, home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena, generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks (Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón Bolívar), and the La Guajira Desert. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura.[160][163][164]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta as seen from the ISS\nPart of the Ring of Fire, a region of the world subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions,[165] in the interior of Colombia the Andes are the prevailing geographical feature. Most of Colombia's population centers are located in these interior highlands. Beyond the Colombian Massif (in the southwestern departments of Cauca and Nariño), these are divided into three branches known as *cordilleras* (mountain ranges): the Cordillera Occidental, running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of Cali; the Cordillera Central, running between the Cauca and Magdalena River valleys (to the west and east, respectively) and including the cities of Medellín, Manizales, Pereira, and Armenia; and the Cordillera Oriental, extending northeast to the Guajira Peninsula and including Bogotá, Bucaramanga, and Cúcuta.[160][163][164] Peaks in the Cordillera Occidental exceed 4,700 m (15,420 ft), and in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach 5,000 m (16,404 ft). At 2,600 m (8,530 ft), Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.[160]\n\n\nThe main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The Orinoco and Amazon Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.[166]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Colombia\n\n![](image)Colombia map of Köppen climate classification\nThe climate of Colombia is characterized for being tropical presenting variations within six natural regions and depending on the altitude, temperature, humidity, winds and rainfall.[167] Colombia has a diverse range of climate zones, including tropical rainforests, savannas, steppes, deserts and mountain climates.\n\n\nMountain climate is one of the unique features of the Andes and other high altitude reliefs where climate is determined by elevation. Below 1,000 meters (3,281 ft) in elevation is the warm altitudinal zone, where temperatures are above 24 °C (75.2 °F). About 82.5% of the country's total area lies in the warm altitudinal zone. The temperate climate altitudinal zone located between 1,001 and 2,000 meters (3,284 and 6,562 ft) is characterized for presenting an average temperature ranging between 17 and 24 °C (62.6 and 75.2 °F). The cold climate is present between 2,001 and 3,000 meters (6,565 and 9,843 ft) and the temperatures vary between 12 and 17 °C (53.6 and 62.6 °F). Beyond lies the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands of the páramos. Above 4,000 meters (13,123 ft), where temperatures are below freezing, the climate is glacial, a zone of permanent snow and ice.[167]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fauna of Colombia, Flora of Colombia, and Deforestation in Colombia\n\nColombia is one of the megadiverse countries in biodiversity,[168] ranking first in bird species.[169] Colombia is the country with the planet's highest biodiversity, having the highest rate of species by area as well as the largest number of endemisms (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the Earth live in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than in Europe and North America combined. Colombia has 10% of the world's mammals species, 14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the world.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)The national flower of Colombia, the endemic orchid *Cattleya trianae*, is named for Colombian botanist and physician José Jerónimo Triana.[171]\nAs for plants, the country has between 40,000 and 45,000 plant species, equivalent to 10 or 20% of total global species, which is even more remarkable given that Colombia is considered a country of intermediate size.[172] Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world, lagging only after Brazil which is approximately 7 times bigger.[29]\n\n\nColombia has about 2,000 species of marine fish and is the second most diverse country in freshwater fish. It is also the country with the most endemic species of butterflies, is first in orchid species, and has approximately 7,000 species of beetles. Colombia is second in the number of amphibian species and is the third most diverse country in reptiles and palms. There are about 1,900 species of mollusks and according to estimates there are about 300,000 species of invertebrates in the country. In Colombia there are 32 terrestrial biomes and 314 types of ecosystems.[173][174]\n\n\nProtected areas and the \"National Park System\" cover an area of about 14,268,224 hectares (142,682.24 km2) and account for 12.77% of the Colombian territory.[175] Compared to neighboring countries, rates of deforestation in Colombia are still relatively low.[176] Colombia had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.26/10, ranking it 25th globally out of 172 countries.[177] Colombia is the sixth country in the world by magnitude of total renewable freshwater supply, and still has large reserves of freshwater.[178]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Colombia\n\nSee also: Colombian Constitution of 1991\n\n![](image)Casa de Nariño is the official home and principal workplace of the President of Colombia.\nThe government of Colombia takes place within the framework of a presidential participatory democratic republic as established in the Constitution of 1991.[134] In accordance with the principle of separation of powers, government is divided into three branches: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch.[179]\n\n\nAs the head of the executive branch, the President of Colombia serves as both head of state and head of government, followed by the Vice President and the Council of Ministers. The president is elected by popular vote to serve a single four-year term (In 2015, Colombia's Congress approved the repeal of a 2004 constitutional amendment that changed the one-term limit for presidents to a two-term limit).[180] At the provincial level executive power is vested in department governors, municipal mayors and local administrators for smaller administrative subdivisions, such as *corregimientos* or *comunas*.[181] All regional elections are held one year and five months after the presidential election.[182][183]\n\n\n\n![](image)Capitolio Nacional seat of the Congress.\nThe legislative branch of government is represented nationally by the Congress, a bicameral institution comprising a 166-seat Chamber of Representatives and a 102-seat Senate.[184][185] The Senate is elected nationally and the Chamber of Representatives is elected in electoral districts.[186] Members of both houses are elected to serve four-year terms two months before the president, also by popular vote.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palace of Justice of Colombia, seat and symbol of the Judiciary of Colombia\nThe judicial branch is headed by four high courts,[188] consisting of the Supreme Court which deals with penal and civil matters, the Council of State, which has special responsibility for administrative law and also provides legal advice to the executive, the Constitutional Court, responsible for assuring the integrity of the Colombian constitution, and the Superior Council of Judicature, responsible for auditing the judicial branch.[189] Colombia operates a system of civil law, which since 1991 has been applied through an adversarial system.[190]\n\n\nDespite a number of controversies, the democratic security policy has ensured that former President Álvaro Uribe remained popular among Colombian people, with his approval rating peaking at 76%, according to a poll in 2009.[191] However, having served two terms, he was constitutionally barred from seeking re-election in 2010.[192] In the run-off elections on 20 June 2010 the former Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos won with 69% of the vote against the second most popular candidate, Antanas Mockus. A second round was required since no candidate received over the 50% winning threshold of votes.[193] Santos won re-election with nearly 51% of the vote in second-round elections on 15 June 2014, beating right-wing rival Óscar Iván Zuluaga, who won 45%.[194] In 2018, Iván Duque won in the second round of the election with 54% of the vote, against 42% for his left-wing rival, Gustavo Petro. His term as Colombia's president ran for four years, beginning on 7 August 2018.[195] In 2022, Colombia elected Gustavo Petro, who became its first leftist leader,[196] and Francia Marquez, who was the first black person elected as vice president.[197]\n\n\n\n### Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Colombia\n\nSee also: Diplomatic missions of Colombia\n\n![](image)The VII Summit of the Pacific Alliance: Former President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos is second from the left.\nThe foreign affairs of Colombia are headed by the President, as head of state, and managed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.[198] Colombia has diplomatic missions in all continents.[199]\n\n\nColombia was one of the four founding members of the Pacific Alliance, which is a political, economic and co-operative integration mechanism that promotes the free circulation of goods, services, capital and persons between the members, as well as a common stock exchange and joint embassies in several countries.[200] Colombia is also a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, and the Andean Community of Nations.[201][202][203][204][205] Colombia is a global partner of NATO.[206]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Military of Colombia\n\n![](image)Colombian Navy Frigate ARC *Caldas*\nThe executive branch of government is responsible for managing the defense of Colombia, with the President commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The Ministry of Defence exercises day-to-day control of the military and the Colombian National Police. Colombia has 455,461 active military personnel.[207] In 2016, 3.4% of the country's GDP went towards military expenditure, placing it 24th in the world. Colombia's armed forces are the largest in Latin America, and it is the second largest spender on its military after Brazil.[208][209] In 2018, Colombia signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[210]\n\n\nThe Colombian military is divided into three branches: the National Army of Colombia; the Colombian Aerospace Force; and the Colombian Navy. The National Police functions as a gendarmerie, operating independently from the military as the law enforcement agency for the entire country. Each of these operates with their own intelligence apparatus separate from the National Intelligence Directorate (DNI, in Spanish).[211]\n\n\nThe National Army is formed by divisions, brigades, special brigades, and special units,[212] the Colombian Navy by the Naval Infantry, the Naval Force of the Caribbean, the Naval Force of the Pacific, the Naval Force of the South, the Naval Force of the East, Colombia Coast Guards, Naval Aviation, and the Specific Command of San Andres y Providencia[213] and the Aerospace Force by 15 air units.[214] The National Police has a presence in all municipalities.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Departments of Colombia and Municipalities of Colombia\n\nSee also: List of cities in Colombia and Corregimientos of Colombia\n\nColombia is divided into 32 departments and one capital district, which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca). Departments are subdivided into municipalities, each of which is assigned a municipal seat, and municipalities are in turn subdivided into *corregimientos* in rural areas and into *comunas* in urban areas. Each department has a local government with a governor and assembly directly elected to four-year terms, and each municipality is headed by a mayor and council. There is a popularly elected local administrative board in each of the *corregimientos* or *comunas*.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nIn addition to the capital, four other cities have been designated districts (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta and Buenaventura. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example, in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as \"department *corregimientos*\", which are a hybrid of a municipality and a *corregimiento*.[215][216]\n\n\nClick on a department on the map below to go to its article.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  | Department | Capital city\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![Flag of the Department of Amazonas](image) Amazonas | Leticia |\n| 2 | ![Flag of the Department of Antioquia](image) Antioquia | Medellín |\n| 3 | ![Flag of the Department of Arauca](image) Arauca | Arauca |\n| 4 | ![Flag of the Department of Atlántico](image) Atlántico | Barranquilla |\n| 5 | ![Flag of the Department of Bolívar](image) Bolívar | Cartagena |\n| 6 | ![Flag of the Department of Boyacá](image) Boyacá | Tunja |\n| 7 | ![Flag of the Department of Caldas](image) Caldas | Manizales |\n| 8 | ![Flag of the Department of Caquetá](image) Caquetá | Florencia |\n| 9 | ![Flag of the Department of Casanare](image) Casanare   | Yopal |\n| 10 | ![Flag of the Department of Cauca](image) Cauca | Popayán |\n| 11 | ![Flag of the Department of Cesar](image) Cesar | Valledupar       |\n| 12 | ![Flag of the Department of Chocó](image) Chocó | Quibdó |\n| 13 | ![Flag of the Department of Córdoba](image) Córdoba | Montería |\n| 14 | ![Flag of the Department of Cundinamarca](image) Cundinamarca | Bogotá |\n| 15 | ![Flag of the Department of Guainía](image) Guainía | Inírida |\n| 16 | ![Flag of the Department of Guaviare](image) Guaviare | San José del Guaviare |\n| 17 | ![Flag of the Department of Huila](image) Huila | Neiva |\n\n | \n\n|  | Department | Capital city\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 18 | ![Flag of La Guajira](image) La Guajira   | Riohacha |\n| 19 | ![Flag of the Department of Magdalena](image) Magdalena | Santa Marta |\n| 20 | ![Flag of the Department of Meta](image) Meta | Villavicencio |\n| 21 | ![Flag of the Department of Nariño](image) Nariño | Pasto |\n| 22 | ![Flag of the Department of Norte de Santander](image) Norte de Santander | Cúcuta |\n| 23 | ![Flag of the Department of Putumayo](image) Putumayo | Mocoa |\n| 24 | ![Flag of the Department of Quindío](image) Quindío | Armenia |\n| 25 | ![Flag of the Department of Risaralda](image) Risaralda | Pereira |\n| 26 | ![Flag of the Department of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina](image) San Andrés, Providenciaand Santa Catalina | San Andrés |\n| 27 | ![Flag of the Department of Santander](image) Santander | Bucaramanga |\n| 28 | ![Flag of the Department of Sucre](image) Sucre | Sincelejo |\n| 29 | ![Flag of the Department of Tolima](image) Tolima | Ibagué |\n| 30 | ![Flag of the Department of Valle del Cauca](image) Valle del Cauca | Cali |\n| 31 | ![Flag of the Department of Vichada](image) Vaupés | Mitú |\n| 32 | ![Flag of the Department of Vichada](image) Vichada | Puerto Carreño |\n| 33 | ![Flag of Bogotá](image) Bogotá | Bogotá |\n\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Colombia\n\nSee also: Industry of Colombia\n\n![](image)Skyline of Bogotá's skyscrapers\n![](image)Colombia GDP by sector in 2017.\n![](image)Bancolombia headquarters in Medellín\nHistorically an agrarian economy, Colombia urbanized rapidly in the 20th century, by the end of which just 15.8% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, generating just 6.6% of GDP; 19.6% of the workforce were employed in industry and 64.6% in services, responsible for 33.4% and 59.9% of GDP respectively.[219][220] The country's economic production is dominated by its strong domestic demand. Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP.[221][31][222]\n\n\nColombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[26] According to International Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012, Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion (28th in the world and third in South America).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTotal government expenditures account for 27.9 percent of the domestic economy. External debt equals 39.9 percent of gross domestic product. A strong fiscal climate was reaffirmed by a boost in bond ratings.[223][224][225] Annual inflation closed 2017 at 4.09% YoY (vs. 5.75% YoY in 2016).[226] The average national unemployment rate in 2017 was 9.4%,[227] although the informality is the biggest problem facing the labour market (the income of formal workers climbed 24.8% in 5 years while labor incomes of informal workers rose only 9%).[228] Colombia has free-trade zones (FTZ),[229] such as Zona Franca del Pacifico, located in the Valle del Cauca, one of the most striking areas for foreign investment.[230]\n\n\nThe financial sector has grown favorably due to good liquidity in the economy, the growth of credit and the positive performance of the Colombian economy.[32][231][232] The Colombian Stock Exchange through the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA) offers a regional market to trade equities.[233][234] Colombia is now one of only three economies with a perfect score on the strength of legal rights index, according to the World Bank.[235]\n\n\nColombia is rich in natural resources, and it is heavily dependent on energy and mining exports.[236] Colombia's main exports include mineral fuels, oils, distillation products, fruit and other agricultural products, sugars and sugar confectionery, food products, plastics, precious stones, metals, forest products, chemical goods, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, electronic products, electrical equipment, perfumery and cosmetics, machinery, manufactured articles, textile and fabrics, clothing and footwear, glass and glassware, furniture, prefabricated buildings, military products, home and office material, construction equipment, software, among others.[237] Principal trading partners are the United States, China, the European Union and some Latin American countries.[238][239]\n\n\nNon-traditional exports have boosted the growth of Colombian foreign sales as well as the diversification of destinations of export thanks to new free trade agreements.[240] Recent economic growth has led to a considerable increase of new millionaires, including the new entrepreneurs, Colombians with a net worth exceeding US$1 billion.[241][242]\n\n\nIn 2017, however, the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) reported that 26.9% of the population were living below the poverty line, of which 7.4% were in \"extreme poverty\". The multidimensional poverty rate stands at 17.0 percent of the population.[8] The Government has also been developing a process of financial inclusion within the country's most vulnerable population.[243]\n\n\nThe contribution of tourism to GDP was US$5,880.3bn (2.0% of total GDP) in 2016. Tourism generated 556,135 jobs (2.5% of total employment) in 2016.[244] Foreign tourist visits were predicted to have risen from 0.6 million in 2007 to 4 million in 2017.[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and natural resources[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Agriculture in Colombia and Mining in Colombia\n\n![](image)Cerrejón is an open-pit coal mine, the largest of its type, the largest in Latin America and the tenth biggest in the world\nIn agriculture, Colombia is one of the 5 largest producers in the world of coffee, avocado and palm oil, and one of the 10 largest producers in the world of sugarcane, banana, pineapple and cocoa. The country also has considerable production of rice, potato and cassava. Although it is not the largest coffee producer in the world (Brazil claims that title), the country has been able to carry out, for decades, a global marketing campaign to add value to the country's product. Colombian palm oil production is one of the most sustainable on the planet, compared to the largest existing producers. Colombia is also among the 20 largest producers in the world of beef and chicken meat.[247][248][249] Colombia is also the 2nd largest flower exporter in the world, after the Netherlands.[250]\n\n\nColombia is an important exporter of coal and petroleum – in 2020, more than 40% of the country's exports were based on these two products.[251] In 2018 it was the 5th largest coal exporter in the world.[252] In 2019, Colombia was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, with 791 thousand barrels/day, exporting a good part of its production – the country was the 19th largest oil exporter in the world in 2020.[253] In mining, Colombia is the world's largest producer of emerald,[254] and in the production of gold, between 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, beating the record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. Currently, the country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world.[255]\n\n\n\n### Energy and transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Electricity sector in Colombia and Transport in Colombia\n\n![](image)Sogamoso Dam\nThe electricity production in Colombia comes mainly from Renewable energy sources. 69.93% is obtained from the hydroelectric generation.[256] Colombia's commitment to renewable energy was recognized in the 2014 *Global Green Economy Index (GGEI)*, ranking among the top 10 nations in the world in terms of greening efficiency sectors.[257]\n\n\n\n![](image)Port of Cartagena\nTransportation in Colombia is regulated within the functions of the Ministry of Transport[258] and entities such as the National Roads Institute (INVÍAS) responsible for the Highways in Colombia,[259] the Aerocivil, responsible for civil aviation and airports,[260] the National Infrastructure Agency, in charge of concessions through public–private partnerships, for the design, construction, maintenance, operation, and administration of the transport infrastructure,[261] the General Maritime Directorate (Dimar) has the responsibility of coordinating maritime traffic control along with the Colombian Navy,[262] among others and under the supervision of the Superintendency of Ports and Transport.[263]\n\n\nIn 2021, Colombia had 204,389 km (127,001 mi) of roads, 32,280 km (20,058 mi) of which were paved. At the end of 2017, the country had around 2,100 km (1,305 mi) of duplicated highways.[264][265][266] Rail transportation in Colombia is dedicated almost entirely to freight shipments and the railway network has a length of 1,700 km of potentially active rails.[266] Colombia has 3,960 kilometers of gas pipelines, 4,900 kilometers of oil pipelines, and 2,990 kilometers of refined-products pipelines.[266]\n\n\nThe target of Colombia's government is to build 7,000 km of roads for the 2016–2020 period and reduce travel times by 30 per cent and transport costs by 20 per cent. A toll road concession programme will comprise 40 projects, and is part of a larger strategic goal to invest nearly $50 bn in transport infrastructure, including: railway systems; making the Magdalena river navigable again; improving port facilities; as well as an expansion of Bogotá's airport.[267][*needs update*] Colombia is a middle-income country.[268]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Colombia\n\n![](image)Colciencias is a Colombian Government agency that supports fundamental and applied research.\nColombia has more than 3,950 research groups in science and technology.[269] iNNpulsa, a government body that promotes entrepreneurship and innovation in the country, provides grants to startups, in addition to other services it and institutions provide. Colombia was ranked 66th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[270] Co-working spaces have arisen to serve as communities for startups large and small.[271][272] Organizations such as the Corporation for Biological Research (CIB) for the support of young people interested in scientific work has been successfully developed in Colombia.[273] The International Center for Tropical Agriculture based in Colombia investigates the increasing challenge of global warming and food security.[274]\n\n\nImportant inventions related to medicine have been made in Colombia, such as the first external artificial pacemaker with internal electrodes, invented by the electrical engineer Jorge Reynolds Pombo, an invention of great importance for those who suffer from heart failure. Also invented in Colombia were the microkeratome and keratomileusis technique, which form the fundamental basis of what now is known as LASIK (one of the most important techniques for the correction of refractive errors of vision) and the Hakim valve for the treatment of hydrocephalus.[275] Colombia has begun to innovate in military technology for its army and other armies of the world; especially in the design and creation of personal ballistic protection products, military hardware, military robots, bombs, simulators and radar.[276][277][278]\n\n\nSome leading Colombian scientists are Joseph M. Tohme, researcher recognized for his work on the genetic diversity of food, Manuel Elkin Patarroyo who is known for his groundbreaking work on synthetic vaccines for malaria, Francisco Lopera who discovered the \"Paisa Mutation\" or a type of early-onset Alzheimer's,[279] Rodolfo Llinás known for his study of the intrinsic neurons properties and the theory of a syndrome that had changed the way of understanding the functioning of the brain, Jairo Quiroga Puello recognized for his studies on the characterization of synthetic substances which can be used to fight fungus, tumors, tuberculosis and even some viruses and Ángela Restrepo who established accurate diagnoses and treatments to combat the effects of a disease caused by *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis*.[280][281][282]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Colombia\n\nSee also: List of Colombian Departments by population\n\n![](image)Population density of Colombia in 2013\nWith an estimated 50 million people in 2020, Colombia is the third-most populous country in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico.[283] At the beginning of the 20th century, Colombia's population was approximately 4 million.[284] Since the early 1970s Colombia has experienced steady declines in its fertility, mortality, and population growth rates. The population growth rate for 2016 is estimated to be 0.9%.[285] About 26.8% of the population were 15 years old or younger, 65.7% were between 15 and 64 years old, and 7.4% were over 65 years old. The proportion of older persons in the total population has begun to increase substantially.[286] Colombia is projected to have a population of 55.3 million by 2050.[287]\n\n\nThe population is concentrated in the Andean highlands and along the Caribbean coast, also the population densities are generally higher in the Andean region. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's area, have less than 6% of the population.[163][164] Traditionally a rural society, movement to urban areas was very heavy in the mid-20th century, and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to nearly 60% in 1973, and by 2014 the figure stood at 76%.[288][289] The population of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 8 million today.[290] In total seventy-two cities now have populations of 100,000 or more (2015). As of 2012[update] Colombia has the world's largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs), estimated to be up to 4.9 million people.[291]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is 74.8 years in 2015 and infant mortality is 13.1 per thousand in 2016.[292][293] In 2015, 94.58% of adults and 98.66% of youth are literate and the government spends about 4.49% of its GDP on education.[294]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Colombia\n\nSee also: Colombian Spanish\n\nMore than 99.2% of Colombians speak Spanish, also called Castilian; 65 Amerindian languages, two Creole languages, the Romani language and Colombian Sign Language are also used in the country. English has official status in the archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina.[11][295][296][297]\n\n\nIncluding Spanish, a total of 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database. The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider to be varieties or dialects of the same language. Best estimates recorded 71 languages that are spoken in-country today – most of which belong to the Chibchan, Tucanoan, Bora–Witoto, Guajiboan, Arawakan, Cariban, Barbacoan, and Saliban language families. There are currently about 850,000 speakers of native languages.[298][299]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human biological diversity and ethnicity in Colombia\n\nHuman biological diversity and ethnicity-**2018 Census** [2]\n\n\n\nWhite and Mestizo (87.58%)\nAfro-Colombian (includes Mixed) (6.68%)\nAmerindian (4.31%)\nNot Stated (1.35%)\nRaizal (0.06%)\nPalenquero (0.02%)\nRomani (0.01%)\n\nColombia is ethnically diverse, its people descending from the original Amerindian inhabitants, Spanish colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.[300] The demographic distribution reflects a pattern that is influenced by colonial history.[301] Whites live all throughout the country, mainly in urban centers and the burgeoning highland and coastal cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizo *campesinos* (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian chiefdoms. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.[302]\n\n\nThe 2018 census reported that the \"non-ethnic population\", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 87.6% of the national population. 6.7% is of African ancestry. Indigenous Amerindians constitute 4.3% of the population. Raizal people constitute 0.06% of the population. Palenquero people constitute 0.02% of the population. 0.01% of the population are Roma.\n\n\nThe Federal Research Division estimated that the 86% of the population that did not consider themselves part of one of the ethnic groups indicated by the 2006 census was divided into 49% Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, and 37% White, mainly of Spanish lineage, but there is also a large population of Middle East descent; in some sectors of society there is a considerable input of German and Italian ancestry.[303][2]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPeople with African ancestry in Colombia are concentrated mostly in coastal areas.\n![](image)\nAmerindian population of Colombia by municipality in 2005.\n\nMany of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during the Spanish rule[304] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures. Reserves (*resguardos*) established for indigenous peoples occupy 30,571,640 hectares (305,716.4 km2) (27% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more than 800,000 people.[305] Some of the largest indigenous groups are the Wayuu,[306] the Paez, the Pastos, the Emberá and the Zenú.[307] The departments of La Guajira, Cauca, Nariño, Córdoba and Sucre have the largest indigenous populations.[2]\n\n\nThe Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia (ONIC), founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982, is an organization representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia. In 1991, Colombia signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.[308]\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africans were brought as slaves, mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian communities are found today on the Pacific Coast.[309] Numerous Jamaicans migrated mainly to the islands of San Andres and Providencia. A number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including people from the former USSR during and after the Second World War.[310][311]\n\n\nMany immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle East and Europe. Barranquilla (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of Lebanese, Palestinian, and other Levantines.[312][313] There are also important communities of Romanis and Jews.[300] There is a major migration trend of Venezuelans, due to the political and economic situation in Venezuela.[314] In August 2019, Colombia offered citizenship to more than 24,000 children of Venezuelan refugees who were born in Colombia.[315]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Colombia\n\nSee also: Freedom of religion in Colombia and Jews in Colombia\n\n![](image)The Las Lajas Sanctuary in the southern Colombian Department of Nariño\nThe National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%–79%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as the Baháʼí Faith, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Eastern Orthodox Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.[316][317][318]\n\n\nWhile Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion and all religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.[319]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health care in Colombia\n\n![](image)Colombia leads the annual *América Economía* ranking of the best clinics and hospitals in Latin America.[320]\nThe overall life expectancy in Colombia at birth is 79.3 years (76.7 years for males and 81.9 years for females).[292] Healthcare reforms have led to massive improvements in the healthcare systems of the country, with health standards in Colombia improving very much since the 1980s. The new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 96% in 2012.[321] In 2017, the government declared a cancer research and treatment center as a Project of National Strategic Interest.[322]\n\n\nA 2016 study conducted by *América Economía* magazine ranked 21 Colombian health care institutions among the top 44 in Latin America, amounting to 48 percent of the total.[320] In 2022, 26 Colombian hospitals were among the 61 best in Latin America (42% total).[323] Also in 2023, two Colombian hospitals were among the Top 75 of the world.[324][325]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Colombia\n\nThe educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five (*Educación preescolar*). Basic education (*Educación básica*) is compulsory by law.[326] It has two stages: Primary basic education (*Educación básica primaria*) which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (*Educación básica secundaria*), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (*Educación media vocacional*) that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.[327]\n\n\n\n![](image)M5 building – National University of Colombia, designed by Pedro Nel Gómez\nAfter the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a *bachiller*, because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called *bachillerato* (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test (now renamed Saber 11) to gain access to higher education (*Educación superior*). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the SENA after a two years curriculum.[328]\n\n\n*Bachilleres* (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.[327]\n\n\nPublic spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2015 was 4.49%. This represented 15.05% of total government expenditure. The primary and secondary gross enrolment ratios stood at 113.56% and 98.09% respectively. School-life expectancy was 14.42 years. A total of 94.58% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 98.66% of those aged 15–24.[294]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colombian National Police Special Operations Command (COPES), displayed in Pereira. A subdivision of the National Police for the fight against organized crime and terrorist acts.\nThis section is an excerpt from Crime in Colombia.[edit]\nColombia has a high crime rate due to being a center for the cultivation and trafficking of cocaine. The Colombian conflict began in the mid-1960s and is a low-intensity conflict between Colombian governments, paramilitary groups, crime syndicates, and left-wing guerrillas such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN), fighting each other to increase their influence in Colombian territory. Two of the most important international actors that have contributed to the Colombian conflict are multinational companies and the United States.[329][330][331]\n\n\nElements of all the armed groups have been involved in drug trafficking. In a country where state capacity has been weak in some regions, the result has been a grinding war on multiple fronts, with the civilian population caught in between and often deliberately targeted for \"collaborating\". Human rights advocates blame paramilitaries for massacres, \"disappearances\", and cases of torture and forced displacement. Rebel groups are behind assassinations, kidnapping and extortion.[332]\n\n\nIn 2011, President Juan Manuel Santos launched the \"Borders for Prosperity\" plan[333] to fight poverty and combat violence from illegal armed groups along Colombia's borders through social and economic development.[334] The plan received praise from the International Crisis Group.[335] Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year the government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.[336] The murder rate further decreased to 22.6 in 2020, though still among the highest in the world, it decreased 73% from 84 in 1991. In the 1980s and 1990s it regularly ranked as number one.\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis in Venezuela and the mass emigration of Venezuelans during the Venezuelan refugee crisis, desperate Venezuelans have been recruited into gangs in order to survive.[337] Venezuelan women have also resorted to prostitution in order to make a living in Colombia.[337]\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nColombia is a highly urbanized country with 77.1% of the population living in urban areas. The largest cities in the country are Bogotá, with 7,387,400 inhabitants, Medellín, with 2,382,399 inhabitants, Cali, with 2,172,527 inhabitants, and Barranquilla, with 1,205,284 inhabitants.[338]\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in ColombiaAccording to the 2018 Census[339]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Department | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Department | Pop. |  |\n| ![Bogotá](image)Bogotá![Medellín](image)Medellín | 1 | Bogotá | Distrito Capital | 7,387,400 | 11 | Ibagué | Tolima | 492,554\n | ![Cali](image)Cali![Barranquilla](image)Barranquilla |\n| 2 | Medellín | Antioquia | 2,382,399 | 12 | Villavicencio | Meta | 492,052\n |\n| 3 | Cali | Valle del Cauca | 2,172,527 | 13 | Santa Marta | Magdalena | 455,299\n |\n| 4 | Barranquilla | Atlántico | 1,205,284 | 14 | Valledupar | Cesar | 431,794\n |\n| 5 | Cartagena | Bolívar | 876,885 | 15 | Manizales | Caldas | 405,234\n |\n| 6 | Cúcuta | Norte de Santander | 685,445 | 16 | Montería | Córdoba | 388,499\n |\n| 7 | Soacha | Cundinamarca | 655,025 | 17 | Pereira | Risaralda | 385,838\n |\n| 8 | Soledad | Atlántico | 602,644 | 18 | Neiva | Huila | 335,994\n |\n| 9 | Bucaramanga | Santander | 570,752 | 19 | Pasto | Nariño | 308,095\n |\n| 10 | Bello | Antioquia | 495,483 | 20 | Armenia | Quindío | 287,245\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Colombia\n\nSee also: Festivals in Colombia and Colombian folklore\n\nColombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. Native American, Spanish and other European, African, American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany national symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture.[340]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colombian literature\n\n![](image)The Nobel literature prize winner Gabriel García Márquez[341]\nColombian literature dates back to pre-Columbian era; a notable example of the period is the epic poem known as the *Legend of Yurupary*.[342] In Spanish colonial times, notable writers include Juan de Castellanos (*Elegías de varones ilustres de Indias*), Hernando Domínguez Camargo and his epic poem to San Ignacio de Loyola, Pedro Simón, Juan Rodríguez Freyle (*El Carnero*),[343] Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita, and the nun Francisca Josefa de Castillo, representative of mysticism.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPost-independence literature linked to Romanticism highlighted Antonio Nariño, José Fernández Madrid, Camilo Torres Tenorio and Francisco Antonio Zea.[344][345] In the second half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century the literary genre known as *costumbrismo* became popular; great writers of this period were Tomás Carrasquilla, Jorge Isaacs and Rafael Pombo (the latter of whom wrote notable works of children's literature).[346][347] Within that period, authors such as José Asunción Silva, José Eustasio Rivera, León de Greiff, Porfirio Barba-Jacob and José María Vargas Vila developed the modernist movement.[348][349][350] In 1872, Colombia established the Colombian Academy of Language, the first Spanish language academy in the Americas.[351] Candelario Obeso wrote the groundbreaking *Cantos Populares de mi Tierra* (1877), the first book of poetry by an Afro-Colombian author.[352][353]\n\n\nBetween 1939 and 1940 seven books of poetry were published under the name *Stone and Sky* in the city of Bogotá that significantly influenced the country; they were edited by the poet Jorge Rojas.[354] In the following decade, Gonzalo Arango founded the movement of \"nothingness\" in response to the violence of the time;[355] he was influenced by nihilism, existentialism, and the thought of another great Colombian writer: Fernando González Ochoa.[356] During the boom in Latin American literature, successful writers emerged, led by Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez and his magnum opus, *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, Eduardo Caballero Calderón, Manuel Mejía Vallejo, and Álvaro Mutis, a writer who was awarded the Cervantes Prize and the Prince of Asturias Award for Letters.[357][358] Other leading contemporary authors are Fernando Vallejo, William Ospina (Rómulo Gallegos Prize) and Germán Castro Caycedo.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colombian art\n\n![](image)\nWork by the painter and sculptor Fernando Botero\n![](image)\nColonial painting The Virgin of Chiquinquirá (1562) by Alonso de Narváez.[359][360] She is the Catholic Patroness of Colombia. The original canvas is located in the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá.\n![](image)\nMural by Santiago Martínez Delgado\n\nColombian art has over 3,000 years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000 BCE.[361][362]\n\n\nThe earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people[363] of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Roughly between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the San Agustín culture, masters of stonecutting, entered its \"classical period\". They erected raised ceremonial centers, sarcophagi, and large stone monoliths depicting anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms out of stone.[362][364]\n\n\nColombian art has followed the trends of the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, Spanish Catholicism had a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular baroque style was replaced with rococo when the Bourbons ascended to the Spanish crown.[365][366] During this era, in the Spanish colony, the most important Neogranadine (Colombian) painters were Gregorio Vásquez de Arce y Ceballos, Gaspar de Figueroa, Baltasar Vargas de Figueroa, Baltasar de Figueroa (the Elder), Antonio Acero de la Cruz and Joaquín Gutiérrez, of which their works are preserved. Also important was Alonso de Narváez who, although born in the Province of Seville, spent most of his life in colonial Colombia, also the Italian Angelino Medoro, lived in Colombia and Peru, and left works of art preserved in several churches in Tunja city. \n\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, one of the most remarkable painters was Ramón Torres Méndez, who produced a series of good quality paintings depicting the people and their customs of different Colombian regions. Also noteworthy in the 19th century were Andrés de Santa María, Pedro José Figueroa, Epifanio Garay, Mercedes Delgado Mallarino, José María Espinosa, Ricardo Acevedo Bernal, between many others. \n\n\nMore recently, Colombian artists Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martínez Delgado started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the neoclassical features of Art Deco.[361][362][367][368] Since the 1950s, the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of this are the Greiff portraits by Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo, showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his paradigmatic \"Naturaleza muerta en silencio\" (silent dead nature), combines geometrical abstraction and cubism. Alejandro Obregón is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with symbolic and expressionist use of animals, (specially the Andean condor).[362][369][370] Fernando Botero, Omar Rayo, Enrique Grau, Édgar Negret, David Manzur, Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt, Oscar Murillo, Doris Salcedo and Oscar Muñoz are some of the Colombian artists featured at the international level.[361][371][372][373]\n\n\nThe Colombian sculpture from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to religious depictions of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of sacred sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain neoclassicist trend.[374] During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.[362][375]\n\n\nColombian photography was marked by the arrival of the daguerreotype. Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros was who brought the daguerreotype process to Colombia in 1841. The Piloto public library has Latin America's largest archive of negatives, containing 1.7 million antique photographs covering Colombia 1848 until 2005.[376][377]\n\n\nThe Colombian press has promoted the work of the cartoonists. In recent decades, fanzines, internet and independent publishers have been fundamental to the growth of the comic in Colombia.[378][379][380]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Colombia\n\nSee also: Muisca architecture\n\nThroughout the times, there have been a variety of architectural styles, from those of indigenous peoples to contemporary ones, passing through colonial (military and religious), Republican, transition and modern styles.[381]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colonial balconies in the streets of Cartagena\n![](image)Colonial Popayán main plaza, Cauca Department\n![](image)Colonial Villa de Leyva, Boyacá Department\nAncient habitation areas, longhouses, crop terraces, roads as the Inca road system, cemeteries, hypogeums and necropolises are all part of the architectural heritage of indigenous peoples.[382] Some prominent indigenous structures are the preceramic and ceramic archaeological site of Tequendama,[383] Tierradentro (a park that contains the largest concentration of pre-Columbian monumental shaft tombs with side chambers),[384] the largest collection of religious monuments and megalithic sculptures in South America, located in San Agustín, Huila,[364][385] Lost city (an archaeological site with a series of terraces carved into the mountainside, a net of tiled roads, and several circular plazas), and the large villages mainly built with stone, wood, cane, and mud.[386]\nArchitecture during the period of conquest and colonization is mainly derived of adapting European styles to local conditions, and Spanish influence, especially Andalusian and Extremaduran, can be easily seen.[387] When Europeans founded cities two things were making simultaneously: the dimensioning of geometrical space (town square, street), and the location of a tangible point of orientation.[388] The construction of forts was common throughout the Caribbean and in some cities of the interior, because of the dangers posed to Spanish colonial settlements from English, French and Dutch pirates and hostile indigenous groups.[389] Churches, chapels, schools, and hospitals belonging to religious orders have a great urban influence.[390] Baroque architecture is used in military buildings and public spaces.[391] Marcelino Arroyo, Francisco José de Caldas and Domingo de Petrés were great representatives of neo-classical architecture.[390]\n\n\nThe National Capitol is a great representative of romanticism.[392] Wood was extensively used in doors, windows, railings, and ceilings during the colonization of Antioquia. The Caribbean architecture acquires a strong Arabic influence.[393] The Teatro Colón in Bogotá is a lavish example of architecture from the 19th century.[394] The quintas houses with innovations in the volumetric conception are some of the best examples of the Republican architecture; the Republican action in the city focused on the design of three types of spaces: parks with forests, small urban parks and avenues and the Gothic style was most commonly used for the design of churches.[395]\n\n\nDeco style, modern neoclassicism, eclecticism folklorist and art deco ornamental resources significantly influenced the architecture of Colombia, especially during the transition period.[396] Modernism contributed with new construction technologies and new materials (steel, reinforced concrete, glass and synthetic materials) and the topology architecture and lightened slabs system also have a great influence.[397] The most influential architects of the modern movement were Rogelio Salmona and Fernando Martínez Sanabria.[398]\n\n\nThe contemporary architecture of Colombia is designed to give greater importance to the materials, this architecture takes into account the specific natural and artificial geographies and is also an architecture that appeals to the senses.[399] The conservation of the architectural and urban heritage of Colombia has been promoted in recent years.[400]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Colombia\n\nColombia has a vibrant collage of talent that touches a full spectrum of rhythms. Musicians, composers, music producers and singers from Colombia are recognized internationally such as Shakira, Juanes, Carlos Vives and others.[401] Colombian music blends European-influenced guitar and song structure with large gaita flutes and percussion instruments from the indigenous population, while its percussion structure and dance forms come from Africa. Colombia has a diverse and dynamic musical environment.[402]\n\n\n\n![](image)Regions of Colombia by its traditional music.\nGuillermo Uribe Holguín, an important cultural figure in the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia, Luis Antonio Calvo and Blas Emilio Atehortúa are some of the greatest exponents of the art music.[403] The Bogotá Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the most active orchestras in Colombia.[404]\n\n\nCaribbean music has many vibrant rhythms, such as cumbia (it is played by the maracas, the drums, the gaitas and guacharaca), porro (it is a monotonous but joyful rhythm), mapalé (with its fast rhythm and constant clapping) and the \"vallenato\", which originated in the northern part of the Caribbean coast (the rhythm is mainly played by the caja, the guacharaca, and accordion).[405][406][407][408][409]\n\n\nThe music from the Pacific coast, such as the currulao, is characterized by its strong use of drums (instruments such as the native marimba, the conunos, the bass drum, the side drum, and the cuatro guasas or tubular rattle). An important rhythm of the south region of the Pacific coast is the contradanza (it is used in dance shows due to the striking colours of the costumes).[405][410][411] Marimba music, traditional chants and dances from the Colombia South Pacific region are on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.[412][413][414]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jorge Celedón of the Binomio de Oro de América band. The Vallenato, along with Cumbia, are the two most popular Colombian folk music genres heard in Latin America.\nImportant musical rhythms of the Andean Region are the danza (dance of Andean folklore arising from the transformation of the European contredance), the bambuco (it is played with guitar, tiple[415] and mandolin, the rhythm is danced by couples), the pasillo (a rhythm inspired by the Austrian waltz and the Colombian \"danza\", the lyrics have been composed by well-known poets), the guabina (the tiple, the bandola and the requinto are the basic instruments), the sanjuanero (it originated in Tolima and Huila Departments, the rhythm is joyful and fast).[416][417][418][419][420] Apart from these traditional rhythms, salsa music has spread throughout the country, and the city of Cali is considered by many salsa singers to be 'The New Salsa Capital of the World'.[405][421][422]\n\n\nThe instruments that distinguish the music of the Eastern Plains are the harp, the cuatro (a type of four-stringed guitar) and maracas. Important rhythms of this region are the joropo (a fast rhythm and there is also tapping as a result of its flamenco ancestry) and the galeron (it is heard a lot while cowboys are working).[405][423][424][425]\n\n\nThe music of the Amazon region is strongly influenced by the indigenous religious practices. Some of the musical instruments used are the manguaré (a musical instrument of ceremonial type, consisting of a pair of large cylindrical drums), the quena (melodic instrument), the rondador, the congas, bells, and different types of flutes.[426][427][428]\n\n\nThe music of the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina is usually accompanied by a mandolin, a tub-bass, a jawbone, a guitar and maracas. Some popular archipelago rhythms are the Schottische, the Calypso, the Polka and the Mento.[429][430]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theater of Colombia, Cinema of Colombia, and Media of Colombia\n\n![](image)The Cartagena Film Festival is the oldest cinema event in Latin America. The central focus is on films from Ibero-America.[431]\nTheater was introduced in Colombia during the Spanish colonization in 1550 through zarzuela companies. Colombian theater is supported by the Ministry of Culture and a number of private and state owned organizations. The Ibero-American Theater Festival of Bogotá is the cultural event of the highest importance in Colombia and one of the biggest theater festivals in the world.[432] Other important theater events are: The Festival of Puppet The Fanfare (Medellín), The Manizales Theater Festival, The Caribbean Theatre Festival (Santa Marta) and The Art Festival of Popular Culture \"Cultural Invasion\" (Bogotá).[433][434][435]\n\n\nAlthough the Colombian cinema is young as an industry, more recently the film industry was growing with support from the Film Act passed in 2003.[436] Many film festivals take place in Colombia, but the two most important are the Cartagena Film Festival, which is the oldest film festival in Latin America, and the Bogotá Film Festival.[431][437][438]\n\n\nSome important national circulation newspapers are *El Tiempo* and *El Espectador*. Television in Colombia has two privately owned TV networks and three state-owned TV networks with national coverage, as well as six regional TV networks and dozens of local TV stations. Private channels, RCN and Caracol are the highest-rated. The regional channels and regional newspapers cover a department or more and its content is made in these particular areas.[439][440][441]\n\n\nColombia has three major national radio networks: Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia, a state-run national radio; Caracol Radio and RCN Radio, privately owned networks with hundreds of affiliates. There are other national networks, including Cadena Super, Todelar, and Colmundo. Many hundreds of radio stations are registered with the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications.[442]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colombian cuisine\n\n![](image)Bandeja paisa (top) and Ajiaco (bottom) are two of the most traditional plates in the country.\nColombia's varied cuisine is influenced by its diverse fauna and flora as well as the cultural traditions of the ethnic groups. Colombian dishes and ingredients vary widely by region. Some of the most common ingredients are: cereals such as rice and maize; tubers such as potato and cassava; assorted legumes; meats, including beef, chicken, pork and goat; fish; and seafood.[443][444] Colombia cuisine also features a variety of tropical fruits such as cape gooseberry, feijoa, arazá, dragon fruit, mangostino, granadilla, papaya, guava, mora (blackberry), lulo, soursop and passionfruit.[445] Colombia is one of the world's largest consumers of fruit juices.[446]\n\n\nAmong the most representative appetizers and soups are patacones (fried green plantains), sancocho de gallina (chicken soup with root vegetables) and ajiaco (potato and corn soup). Representative snacks and breads are pandebono, arepas (corn cakes), aborrajados (fried sweet plantains with cheese), torta de choclo, empanadas and almojábanas. Representative main courses are bandeja paisa, lechona tolimense, mamona, tamales and fish dishes (such as arroz de lisa), especially in coastal regions where kibbeh, suero, costeño cheese and carimañolas are also eaten. Representative side dishes are papas chorreadas (potatoes with cheese), remolachas rellenas con huevo duro (beets stuffed with hard-boiled egg) and arroz con coco (coconut rice).[445][443] Organic food is a current trend in big cities, although in general across the country the fruits and veggies are very natural and fresh.[447][448]\n\n\nRepresentative desserts are buñuelos, natillas, Maria Luisa cake, bocadillo made of guayaba (guava jelly), cocadas (coconut balls), casquitos de guayaba (candied guava peels), torta de natas, obleas, flan de mango, roscón, milhoja, manjar blanco, dulce de feijoa, dulce de papayuela, torta de mojicón, and esponjado de curuba. Typical sauces (salsas) are hogao (tomato and onion sauce) and Colombian-style ají.[445][443]\n\n\nSome representative beverages are coffee (Tinto), champús, cholado, lulada, avena colombiana, sugarcane juice, aguapanela, aguardiente, hot chocolate and fresh fruit juices (often made with water or milk).[445][443]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Colombia\n\n![](image)Mariana Pajón is a Colombian cyclist, two-time Olympic gold medalist and BMX World Champion.\nTejo is Colombia's national sport and is a team sport that involves launching projectiles to hit a target.[449] But of all sports in Colombia, football is the most popular. Colombia was the champion of the 2001 Copa América, in which they set a new record of being undefeated, conceding no goals and winning each match. Colombia has been awarded \"mover of the year\" twice.[450]\n\n\nColombia is a hub for roller skaters. The national team is a perennial powerhouse at the World Roller Speed Skating Championships.[451] Colombia has traditionally been very good in cycling and a large number of Colombian cyclists have triumphed in major competitions of cycling.[452]\n\n\nBaseball is popular in cities like Cartagena and Barranquilla. Of those cities have come good players like: Orlando Cabrera, Édgar Rentería, who was champion of the World Series in 1997 and 2010[453] and others who have played in Major League Baseball.

Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City (commonly referred to by its former name, Saigon).\n\n\nVietnam was inhabited by the Paleolithic age, with states established in the first millennium BC on the Red River Delta in modern-day northern Vietnam. The Han dynasty annexed Northern and Central Vietnam under Chinese rule from 111 BC, until the first dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences through Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta, conquering Champa. During most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Vietnam was effectively divided into two domains of Đàng Trong and Đàng Ngoài. The Nguyễn—the last imperial dynasty—surrendered to France in 1883. In 1887, its territory was integrated into French Indochina as three separate regions. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the nationalist coalition Viet Minh, led by the communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, launched the August Revolution and declared Vietnam's independence in 1945.\n\n\nVietnam went through prolonged warfare in the 20th century. After World War II, France returned to reclaim colonial power in the First Indochina War, from which Vietnam emerged victorious in 1954. As a result of the treaties signed between the Viet Minh and France, Vietnam was also separated into two parts. The Vietnam War began shortly after, between the communist North, supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the anti-communist South, supported by the United States. Upon the North Vietnamese victory in 1975, Vietnam reunified as a unitary socialist state under the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in 1976. An ineffective planned economy, a trade embargo by the West, and wars with Cambodia and China crippled the country further. In 1986, the CPV initiated economic and political reforms similar to the Chinese economic reform, transforming the country to a socialist-oriented market economy. The reforms facilitated Vietnamese reintegration into the global economy and politics.\n\n\nA developing country with a lower-middle-income economy, Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing economies of the 21st century. Vietnam has high levels of corruption, censorship, environmental issues and a poor human rights record; the country ranks among the lowest in international measurements of civil liberties, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion and ethnic minorities. It is part of international and intergovernmental institutions including the ASEAN, the APEC, the CPTPP, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OIF, and the WTO. It has assumed a seat on the United Nations Security Council twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Vietnam\n\nThe name *Việt Nam* (Vietnamese pronunciation: [viə̀t naːm], chữ Hán: 越南), literally \"Viet South\", means \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order or \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order.[9] A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Việt, 南越), was first documented in the 2nd century BC.[10] The term \"Việt\" (Yue) (Chinese: 越; pinyin: *Yuè*; Cantonese Yale: *Yuht*; Wade–Giles: *Yüeh4*; Vietnamese: *Việt*) in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200 BC), and later as \"越\".[11] At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang.[12] In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south.[12] Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.[11][12] From the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of southern China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, Chinese: 百越; pinyin: *Bǎiyuè*; Cantonese Yale: *Baak Yuet*; Vietnamese: *Bách Việt*; \"Hundred Yue/Viet\").[11][12][13] The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book *Lüshi Chunqiu* compiled around 239 BC.[14] By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese apparently referred to themselves as *nguoi Viet* (Viet people) or *nguoi nam* (southern people).[15]\n\n\nThe form *Việt Nam* (越南) is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem *Sấm Trạng Trình*. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Hải Phòng that dates to 1558.[16] In 1802, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (who later became Emperor Gia Long) established the Nguyễn dynasty. In the second year of his rule, he asked the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty to confer on him the title 'King of Nam Việt / Nanyue' (南越 in Chinese character) after seizing power in Annam. The Emperor refused because the name was related to Zhao Tuo's Nanyue, which included the regions of Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China. The Qing Emperor, therefore, decided to call the area \"Việt Nam\" instead,[d][18] meaning \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order but the Vietnamese understood it as \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order.[9] Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.[d] It was revived in the early 20th century in Phan Bội Châu's *History of the Loss of Vietnam*, and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDĐ).[19] The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when the imperial government in Huế adopted *Việt Nam*.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Vietnam\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Vietnamese history.\n\n### Prehistory and early history[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of a Đông Sơn bronze drum](image)A Đông Sơn bronze drum, c. 800 BC\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age. Stone artefacts excavated in Gia Lai province have been claimed to date to 0.78 Ma,[21] based on associated find of tektites, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam.[22] *Homo erectus* fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in Lạng Sơn and Nghệ An provinces in northern Vietnam.[23] The oldest *Homo sapiens* fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum.[24][25][26] Teeth attributed to *Homo sapiens* from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can,[27] and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu,[28][29] Lang Gao[30][31] and Lang Cuom.[32] Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research.[33][34][35][36]\n\n\nBy about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-rice cultivation in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the flourishing of Đông Sơn culture,[37][38] notable for its bronze casting used to make elaborate bronze Đông Sơn drums.[39][40][41] At this point, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of Văn Lang and Âu Lạc appeared, and the culture's influence spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Maritime Southeast Asia, throughout the first millennium BC.[40][42]\n\n\n\n### Dynastic Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Vietnam under Chinese rule.\n\n![](image)Đại Việt, Champa, Angkor Empire and their neighbours, late 13th century\n![](image)Vietnam's territories around 1838, during the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia\nAccording to Vietnamese legends, Hồng Bàng dynasty of the Hùng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first state in the history of Vietnam (then known as Xích Quỷ and later Văn Lang).[43][44] In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán. He consolidated the Lạc Việt and Âu Việt tribes to form the Âu Lạc, proclaiming himself An Dương Vương.[45] In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo (\"Triệu Đà\") defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into Nanyue.[38] However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han–Nanyue War.[18][46] For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule.[47][48] Early independence movements, such as those of the Trưng Sisters and Lady Triệu,[49] were temporarily successful,[50] though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the Anterior Lý dynasty between AD 544 and 602.[51][52][53] By the early 10th century, Northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Khúc family.[54]\n\n\nIn AD 938, the Vietnamese lord Ngô Quyền defeated the forces of the Chinese Southern Han state at Bạch Đằng River and achieved full independence for Vietnam in 939 after a millennium of Chinese domination.[55][56][57] By the 960s, the dynastic Đại Việt (*Great Viet*) kingdom was established, Vietnamese society enjoyed a golden era under the Lý and Trần dynasties. During the rule of the Trần Dynasty, Đại Việt repelled three Mongol invasions.[58][59] Meanwhile, the Mahāyāna branch of Buddhism flourished and became the state religion.[57][60] Following the 1406–7 Ming–Hồ War, which overthrew the Hồ dynasty, Vietnamese independence was interrupted briefly by the Chinese Ming dynasty, but was restored by Lê Lợi, the founder of the Lê dynasty.[61] The Vietnamese polity reached their zenith in the Lê dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of emperor Lê Thánh Tông (1460–1497).[62][63] Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese polity expanded southward in a gradual process known as *Nam tiến* (\"Southward expansion\"),[64] eventually conquering the kingdom of Champa and part of the Khmer Kingdom.[65][66][67]\n\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of Dai Viet. First, the Chinese-supported Mạc dynasty challenged the Lê dynasty's power.[68] After the Mạc dynasty was defeated, the Lê dynasty was nominally reinstalled. Actual power, however, was divided between the northern Trịnh lords and the southern Nguyễn lords, who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s.[69] Vietnam was divided into North (Trịnh) and South (Nguyễn) from 1600 to 1777. During this period, the Nguyễn expanded southern Vietnam into the Mekong Delta, annexing the Central Highlands and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta.[65][67][70] The division of the country ended a century later when the Tây Sơn brothers helped Trịnh to end Nguyễn, they also established new dynasty and ended Trịnh. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguyễn lords, led by Nguyễn Ánh. Nguyễn Ánh unified Vietnam, and established the Nguyễn dynasty, ruling under the name Gia Long.[70]\n\n\n\n### French Indochina[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cochinchina campaign, Sino-French War, Tonkin campaign, and French Indochina\n\nIn the 1500s, the Portuguese explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a stele on the Chàm Islands to mark their presence.[71] By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan.[71] After they had settled in Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau–Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with Hội An.[71] Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries under the *Padroado* system were active in both Vietnamese realms of *Đàng Trong* (Cochinchina or Quinan) and *Đàng Ngoài* (Tonkin) in the 17th century.[72] The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk.[73] Meanwhile, in 1613, the first English attempt to establish contact with Hội An failed following a violent incident involving the Honourable East India Company. By 1672 the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Phố Hiến.[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Capture of Saigon by Charles Rigault de Genouilly on 18 February 1859\nBetween 1615 and 1753, French traders also engaged in trade in Vietnam.[75][76] The first French missionaries arrived in 1658, under the Portuguese *Padroado*. From its foundation, the Paris Foreign Missions Society under *Propaganda Fide* actively sent missionaries to Vietnam, entering Cochinchina first in 1664 and Tonkin first in 1666.[77] Spanish Dominicans joined the Tonkin mission in 1676, and Franciscans were in Cochinchina from 1719 to 1834. The Vietnamese authorities began[*when?*] to feel threatened by continuous Christianisation activities.[78] After several Catholic missionaries were detained, the French Navy intervened in 1843 to free them, as the kingdom was perceived as xenophobic.[79] In a series of conquests from 1859 to 1885, France eroded Vietnam's sovereignty.[80] At the siege of Tourane in 1858, France was aided by Spain (with Filipino, Latin American, and Spanish troops from the Philippines)[81] and perhaps some Tonkinese Catholics.[82] After the 1862 Treaty, and especially after France completely conquered Lower Cochinchina in 1867, the Văn Thân movement of scholar-gentry class arose and committed violence against Catholics across central and northern Vietnam.[83]\n\n\nBetween 1862 and 1867, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina.[84] By 1884, the entire country was under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887.[85][86] The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society.[87] A Western-style system of modern education introduced new humanist values.[88] Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in Saigon, and in Hanoi, the colony's capital.[89]\n\n\nDuring the colonial period, guerrillas of the royalist Cần Vương movement rebelled against French rule and massacred around a third of Vietnam's Christian population.[90][91] After a decade of resistance, they were defeated in the 1890s by the Catholics in reprisal for their earlier massacres.[92][93] Another large-scale rebellion, the Thái Nguyên uprising, was also suppressed heavily.[94] The French developed a plantation economy to promote export of tobacco, indigo, tea and coffee.[95] However, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and self-government. An increasing dissatisfaction, even led to half-hearted, badly co-ordinated, and still worsely executed plots to oust the French, like the infamous Hanoi Poison Plot of 1908.\n\n\n\n![Photograph of the Grand Palais building in Hanoi](image)The Grand Palais built for the 1902–1903 world's fair, when Hanoi was French Indochina's capital\nA nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders like Phan Bội Châu, Phan Châu Trinh, Phan Đình Phùng, Emperor Hàm Nghi, and Hồ Chí Minh fighting or calling for independence.[96] This resulted in the 1930 Yên Bái mutiny by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDĐ), which the French quashed. The mutiny split the independence movement, as many leading members converted to communism.[97][98][99]\n\n\nThe French maintained full control of their colonies until World War II, when the war in the Pacific led to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in 1940. Afterwards, the Japanese Empire was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while the pro-Vichy French colonial administration continued.[100][101] Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945. This led to the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 which killed up to two million people.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### First Indochina War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First Indochina War, Empire of Vietnam, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, State of Vietnam, and Operation Passage to Freedom\n\nIn 1941, the Việt Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh. The Việt Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation.[104][105] After the military defeat of Japan in World War II and the fall of its puppet government Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, Saigon's administrative services collapsed and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread.[106] The Việt Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.[105]\n\n\nIn July 1945, the Allies had decided to divide Indochina at the 16th parallel to allow Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China to receive the Japanese surrender in the north while Britain's Lord Louis Mountbatten received their surrender in the south. The Allies agreed that Indochina still belonged to France.[107][108]\n\n\n\n![Map showing the partition of French Indochina following the 1954 Geneva Conference](image)Partition of French Indochina after the 1954 Geneva Conference\nBut as the French were weakened by the German occupation, British-Indian forces and the remaining Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group were used to maintain order and help France reestablish control through the 1945–1946 War in Vietnam.[109] Hồ initially chose to take a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with France, asking the French to withdraw their colonial administrators and for French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam.[105] But the Provisional Government of the French Republic did not act on these requests, including the idea of independence, and dispatched the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule. This resulted in the Việt Minh launching a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946.[104][105][110] The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954. The defeat of French colonialists and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 battle of Điện Biên Phủ allowed Hồ to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.[105][111]\n\n\nThe colonial administration was thereby ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 into three countries—Vietnam, and the kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam was further divided into North and South administrative regions at the Demilitarised Zone, roughly along the 17th parallel north (pending elections scheduled for July 1956[e]). A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists. This migration was in large part aided by the United States military through Operation Passage to Freedom.[116][117] The partition of Vietnam by the Geneva Accords was not intended to be permanent, and stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after the elections.[118] But in 1955, the southern State of Vietnam's prime minister, Ngô Đình Diệm, toppled Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ngô Đình Nhu, and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam.[118] This effectively replaced the internationally recognised State of Vietnam by the Republic of Vietnam in the south—supported by the United States, France, Laos, Republic of China and Thailand—and Hồ's Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, supported by the Soviet Union, Sweden,[119] Khmer Rouge, and the People's Republic of China.[118]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vietnam War and Role of the United States in the Vietnam War\n\nFrom 1953 to 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political repression.[120] This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions.[121][122] In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political reeducation centres\".[123][124] This program incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time.[125] The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957.[126] The pro-Hanoi Việt Cộng began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government.[127] From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n![Three US Fairchild UC-123B aircraft pictured spraying Agent Orange](image)Three US Fairchild UC-123B aircraft spraying Agent Orange during the Operation Ranch Hand as part of a herbicidal warfare operation depriving the food and vegetation cover of the Việt Cộng, c. 1962–1971\nIn 1963, Buddhist discontent with Diệm's Catholic regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown.[131] This led to the collapse of Diệm's relationship with the United States, and ultimately to a 1963 coup in which he and Nhu were assassinated.[132] The Diệm era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu took control in mid-1965.[133] Thiệu gradually outmaneuvered Kỳ and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971.[134] During this political instability, the communists began to gain ground. To support South Vietnam's struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States used the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident as a pretext for increasing its contribution of military advisers.[135] US forces became involved in ground combat operations by 1965, and at their peak several years later, numbered more than 500,000.[136][137] The US also engaged in sustained aerial bombing. Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant material aid and 15,000 combat advisers.[128][129][138] Communist forces supplying the Việt Cộng carried supplies along the Hồ Chí Minh trail, which passed through Laos.[139]\n\n\nThe communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 Tết Offensive. The campaign failed militarily, but shocked the American establishment and turned US public opinion against the war.[140] During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Huế.[141][142] Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s. This also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilise South Vietnam.[143] Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973.[144] In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Phước Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.[145] South Vietnam was ruled by a provisional government for almost eight years while under North Vietnamese military occupation.[146]\n\n\n\n### Reunification and reforms[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Re-education camp (Vietnam), Vietnamese boat people, and Đổi Mới\n\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.[147] The war devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8 million people.[148][149][150] A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4 million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974—including 415,000 killed.[151][152] In its aftermath, under Lê Duẩn's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears,[153] but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour.[154] The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories.[155] Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war.[156] In 1978, in response to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Kiên Giang,[157] the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh.[158] The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989.[159] However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge. China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the Chinese government escalated.[160]\n\n\nAt the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the \"old guard\" government with new leadership.[161][162] The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguyễn Văn Linh, who became the party's new general secretary.[161] He and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms known as *Đổi Mới* (\"Renovation\") that carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a \"socialist-oriented market economy\".[163][164] Although the authority of the state remained unchallenged under *Đổi Mới*, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation, and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.[164][165] Subsequently, Vietnam's economy achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports, and foreign investment, although these reforms also resulted in a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.[166][167][168]\n\n\nIn 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he is Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.[169]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Vietnam\n\n![Images showing Hạ Long Bay, the Yến River and the Bản-Giốc Waterfalls](image)Nature attractions in Vietnam, clockwise from top: Hạ Long Bay, Yến River, and Bản-Giốc Waterfalls\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8° and 24°N, and the longitudes 102° and 110°E. It covers a total area of approximately 331,212 km2 (127,882 sq mi).[f] The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long.[170] At its narrowest point in the central Quảng Bình Province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north.[171] Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%. Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area,[172] and tropical forests cover around 42%.[173] The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi),[174] is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits.[175][176] The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point. It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year.[177][178] The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) in the South China Sea.[179]\n\n\n\n![Image of the Hoàng Liên Sơn mountain range](image)Hoàng Liên Sơn mountain range, the range that includes Fansipan which is the highest summit on the Indochinese Peninsula\nSouthern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land.[180] The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation.[181] Several minor earthquakes have been recorded.[182][183] The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.[184] From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest.[185] The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.[186][187][188]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Vietnam\n\n![An image of the Köppen climate classification map of Vietnam](image)Köppen climate classification map of Vietnam.\n![Photograph of Nha Trang beach with many high rise buildings behind it](image)Nha Trang, a popular beach destination has a tropical savanna climate.\nDue to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region.[189] During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture.[190] The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north. Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between 21 and 35 °C (70 and 95 °F) over the year.[191] In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33 °C (59 and 91 °F).[191] Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 3 °C (37 °F) in December and January to 37 °C (99 °F) in July and August.[192] During winter, snow occasionally falls over the highest peaks of the far northern mountains near the Chinese border.[193] Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from 1,500 to 2,000 mm (60 to 80 in) during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems.[194] The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons.[194] Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas.[195][196]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Wildlife of Vietnam, Environmental issues in Vietnam, List of endangered species in Vietnam, and Protected areas of Vietnam\n\n![Photographs of Native species in Vietnam the crested argus; the red-shanked douc, a monkey; the Indochinese leopard and the saola, a bovine.](image)Native species in Vietnam, clockwise from top-right: crested argus (a peafowl), red-shanked douc, Indochinese leopard, and saola\nAs the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity. This was noted in the country's National Environmental Condition Report in 2005.[197] It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species. 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic. Vietnam's fauna includes 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians. There are 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic.[197] Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites—the Hạ Long Bay and Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park—together with nine biosphere reserves, including Cần Giờ Mangrove Forest, Cát Tiên, Cát Bà, Kiên Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Nghệ An, Cà Mau, and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park.[198][199][200]\n\n\nVietnam is also home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish.[197] In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam.[197] Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant.[201] In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in Cát Tiên National Park. However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.[202] In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.[197] The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.[197]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of the Sa Pa mountain hills with agricultural activity shiwn in the foreground](image)Sa Pa mountain hills with agricultural activities\nIn Vietnam, wildlife poaching has become a major concern. In 2000, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Education for Nature – Vietnam was founded to instill in the population the importance of wildlife conservation in the country.[203] In the years that followed, another NGO called GreenViet was formed by Vietnamese youngsters for the enforcement of wildlife protection. Through collaboration between the NGOs and local authorities, many local poaching syndicates were crippled by their leaders' arrests.[203] A study released in 2018 revealed Vietnam is a destination for the illegal export of rhinoceros horns from South Africa due to the demand for them as a medicine and a status symbol.[204][205]\n\n\nThe main environmental concern that persists in Vietnam today is the legacy of the use of the chemical herbicide Agent Orange, which continues to cause birth defects and many health problems in the Vietnamese population. In the southern and central areas affected most by the chemical's use during the Vietnam War, nearly 4.8 million Vietnamese people have been exposed to it and suffered from its effects.[206][207][208] In 2012, approximately 50 years after the war,[209] the US began a US$43 million joint clean-up project in the former chemical storage areas in Vietnam to take place in stages.[207][210] Following the completion of the first phase in Đà Nẵng in late 2017,[211] the US announced its commitment to clean other sites, especially in the heavily impacted site of Biên Hòa.[212]\n\n\nThe Vietnamese government spends over VNĐ10 trillion each year ($431.1 million) for monthly allowances and the physical rehabilitation of victims of the chemicals.[213] In 2018, the Japanese engineering group Shimizu Corporation, working with Vietnamese military, built a plant for the treatment of soil polluted by Agent Orange. Plant construction costs were funded by the company itself.[214][215] One of the long-term plans to restore southern Vietnam's damaged ecosystems is through the use of reforestation efforts. The Vietnamese government began doing this at the end of the war. It started by replanting mangrove forests in the Mekong Delta regions and in Cần Giờ outside Hồ Chí Minh City, where mangroves are important to ease (though not eliminate) flood conditions during monsoon seasons.[216] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 104th globally out of 172 countries.[217]\n\n\nApart from herbicide problems, arsenic in the ground water in the Mekong and Red River Deltas has also become a major concern.[218][219] And most notoriously, unexploded ordnances (UXO) pose dangers to humans and wildlife—another bitter legacy from the long wars.[220] As part of the continuous campaign to demine/remove UXOs, several international bomb removal agencies from the United Kingdom,[221] Denmark,[222] South Korea[223] and the US[224] have been providing assistance. The Vietnam government spends over VNĐ1 trillion ($44 million) annually on demining operations and additional hundreds of billions of đồng for treatment, assistance, rehabilitation, vocational training and resettlement of the victims of UXOs.[225]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Hạ Long Bay\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Vietnam and Government of Vietnam\n\nVietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia.[226] Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist,[227][228] with *The Economist* characterising its leadership as \"ardently capitalist communists\".[229] Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country's politics and society.[226] The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy.[226]\n\n\n\n\nThe general secretary of the CPV performs numerous key administrative functions, controlling the party's national organisation.[226] The prime minister is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of five deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions. Only political organisations affiliated with or endorsed by the CPV are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam. These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.[226]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of the National Assembly of Vietnam in Hanoi](image)The National Assembly of Vietnam building in Hanoi\nThe National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral state legislature composed of 500 members.[230] Headed by a chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly.[226] The Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, headed by a chief justice, is the country's highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly. Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and many local courts. Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of state security. Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences.[231]\n\n\nIn 2023, a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing Vietnam. President Vo Van Thuong (since 2023),[232] Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh (since 2021)[233] and the most powerful leader Nguyen Phu Trong (since 2011) as the Communist Party of Vietnam’s General Secretary.[234]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Vietnam\n\n![Trần Đại Quang and Vladimir Putin](image)\nPresident Trần Đại Quang with Russian President Vladimir Putin on 19 November 2016\n![Secretary Tillerson at the Presidential Palace](image)\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accompanies US President Donald Trump to a commercial deal signing ceremony with Vietnamese President on 12 November 2017.\n\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties.[235] Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc.[235] Despite these differences, Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence. These include the 11th-century patriotic poem \"*Nam quốc sơn hà*\" and the 1428 proclamation of independence \"*Bình Ngô đại cáo*\". Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace,[235] significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea.[236] Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO). It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations.[237] As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries.[238]\n\n\nVietnam's current foreign policy is to consistently implement a policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, co-operation, and development, as well openness, diversification, multilateralisation with international relations.[239][240] The country declares itself a friend and partner of all countries in the international community, regardless of their political affiliation, by actively taking part in international and regional cooperative development projects.[164][239] Since the 1990s, Vietnam has taken several key steps to restore diplomatic ties with capitalist Western countries. It already had relations with communist Western countries in the decades prior.[241] Relations with the United States began improving in August 1995 with both states upgrading their *liaison* offices to embassy status.[242] As diplomatic ties between the two governments grew, the United States opened a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City while Vietnam opened its consulate in San Francisco. Full diplomatic relations were also restored with New Zealand, which opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995;[243] Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003.[244] President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made historic visit to Vietnam in November 2000. He was the first U.S. leader ever to officially visit Hanoi and the first to visit Vietnam since U.S. troops withdrew from the country in 1975.[245] Pakistan also reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000, with Vietnam reopening its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005.[246][247] In May 2016, US President Barack Obama further normalised relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam.[248] Despite their historical past, today Vietnam is considered to be a potential ally of the United States, especially in the geopolitical context of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in containment of Chinese expansionism.[249][250][251]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vietnam People's Armed Forces\n\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Self-Defence Militia. The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Guard and the Vietnam Coast Guard. The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000.[252] In 2015, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4 billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending.[253] Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei,[254] India,[255] Japan,[256] Laos,[257] Russia,[258] Singapore[254] and the US.[259] In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Human rights and sociopolitical issues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Vietnam\n\nUnder the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed. Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press. In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer Lê Công Định was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested.[262][263] Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience.[262] Vietnam has also suffered from human trafficking and related issues.[264][265][266]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Vietnam\n\nVietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: *Tỉnh*, chữ Hán: 省).[267] There are also five municipalities (*thành phố trực thuộc trung ương*), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\n56\n\n57\n\n58\n\n59\n\n60\n\n61\n\n62\n\n63\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n✱\n\n✱✱\n\n**Provinces of Vietnam**\n*Island areas:*\n\\*-Bạch Long Vĩ Island (Bạch Long Vĩ District, Haiphong Municipality [3])\n\\*\\*-Phú Quý Islands (Phú Quý District, Bình Thuận Province [46])\n\\*\\*\\*-Côn Đảo Islands (Côn Đảo District, Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu Province [51])\n\\*\\*\\*\\*-Phú Quốc Island (Phú Quốc City, Kiên Giang Province [58])\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*-Thổ Chu Islands (Thổ Châu Commune, Phú Quốc City, Kiên Giang Province [58])\n✱-Paracel Islands (Hoàng Sa District, Đà Nẵng Municipality [4])\n✱✱-Spratly Islands (Trường Sa District, Khánh Hòa Province [43])\n |\n\n\n | \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Northwest**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n6.

Under strict state control, Vietnam's economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction.[271][272][273] With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States,[274][275] Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development.[276]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of Vietnam's tallest skyscraper, the Landmark 81, located in Bình Thạnh District in Ho Chi Minh City](image)Vietnam's tallest skyscraper, the Landmark 81, located in Bình Thạnh, Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon).\nIn 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the CPV introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the *Đổi Mới* reform program. Private ownership began to be encouraged in industry, commerce and agriculture and state enterprises were restructured to operate under market constraints.[277][278] This led to the five-year economic plans being replaced by the socialist-oriented market mechanism.[279] As a result of these reforms, Vietnam achieved approximately 8% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1990 and 1997.[280][281] The United States ended its economic embargo against Vietnam in early 1994.[282] Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused an economic slowdown to 4–5% growth per year, its economy began to recover in 1999,[277] and grew at around 7% per year from 2000 to 2005, one of the fastest in the world.[283][284] On 11 January 2007, Vietnam became the 150th member of the WTO (World Trade Organization).[285] According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), growth remained strong despite the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010. Vietnam's year-on-year inflation rate reached 11.8% in December 2010 and the currency, the Vietnamese đồng, was devalued three times.[286][287]\n\n\nDeep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India and the Philippines.[288] This decline can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality.[289] These policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the *Đổi Mới* program, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare.[290][291] Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets.[289][292] Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy. Although Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia with a total 2011 output of 318,000 barrels per day (50,600 m3/d).[293] In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the eighth-largest crude petroleum producer in the Asia and Pacific region.[294] The US bought the highest amount of Vietnam's exports,[295] while goods from China were the most popular Vietnamese import.[296]\n\n\nBased on findings by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2022, the unemployment rate in Vietnam was 2.3%, the nominal GDP US$406.452 billion, and a nominal GDP per capita $4,086.[6][297] Besides the primary sector economy, tourism has contributed significantly to Vietnam's economic growth with 7.94 million foreign visitors recorded in 2015.[298]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of terraced rice fields in Sa Pa](image)Terraced rice fields in Sa Pa\nAs a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products. It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share;[299] the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market;[300] and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s.[301] Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee.[302] The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other states in the Greater Mekong Subregion.[303] Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products. Agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.\n\n\n\n#### Seafood[edit]\n\n\nThe overall fisheries production of Vietnam from capture fisheries and aquaculture was 5.6 million MT in 2011 and 6.7 million MT in 2016. The output of Vietnam's fisheries sector has seen strong growth, which could be attributed to the continued expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector.[304]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Vietnam\n\n![Photograph of a TOPIO humanoid ping-pong-playing robot](image)A Vietnamese-made TOPIO 3.0 humanoid ping-pong-playing robot displayed during the 2009 International Robot Exhibition (IREX) in Tokyo[305][306]\nIn 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP.[307] Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics. Hoàng Tụy pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century,[308] while Ngô Bảo Châu won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms.[309][310] Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight program especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018.[311][312] Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model.[305][306] One of Vietnam's main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by Vương Quang Khải, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country's largest information technology service company, the FPT Group.[313]\n\n\n\n![Vietnamese science students working on an experiment in their university lab.](image)Vietnamese science students working on an experiment in their university lab\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Vietnam devoted 0.19% of its GDP to science research and development in 2011.[314] Vietnam was ranked 46th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2012, where it was ranked 76th.[315][316] Between 2005 and 2014, the number of Vietnamese scientific publications recorded in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science increased at a rate well above the average for Southeast Asia, albeit from a modest starting point.[317] Publications focus mainly on life sciences (22%), physics (13%) and engineering (13%), which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding.[317]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Vietnam\n\n![Photograph of Hội An, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination](image)Hội An, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a major tourist destination.\nTourism is an important element of economic activity in the nation, contributing 7.5% of the total GDP. Vietnam hosted roughly 13 million tourists in 2017, an increase of 29.1% over the previous year, making it one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. The vast majority of the tourists in the country, some 9.7 million, came from Asia; namely China (4 million), South Korea (2.6 million), and Japan (798,119).[318] Vietnam also attracts large numbers of visitors from Europe, with almost 1.9 million visitors in 2017; most European visitors came from Russia (574,164), followed by the United Kingdom (283,537), France (255,396), and Germany (199,872). Other significant international arrivals by nationality include the United States (614,117) and Australia (370,438).[318]\n\n\nThe most visited destinations in Vietnam is the largest city, Ho Chi Minh City, with over 5.8 million international arrivals, followed by Hanoi with 4.6 million and Hạ Long, including Hạ Long Bay with 4.4 million arrivals. All three are ranked in the top 100 most visited cities in the world.[319] Vietnam is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2018, *Travel + Leisure* ranked Hội An as one of the world's top 15 best destinations to visit.[320]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Vietnam, Rail transport in Vietnam, and List of airports in Vietnam\n\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports. It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam.[321] Vietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level.[322] In 2010, Vietnam's road system had a total length of about 188,744 kilometres (117,280 mi) of which 93,535 kilometres (58,120 mi) are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads.[322] The length of the national road system is about 15,370 kilometres (9,550 mi) with 15,085 kilometres (9,373 mi) of its length paved. The provincial road system has around 27,976 kilometres (17,383 mi) of paved roads while 50,474 kilometres (31,363 mi) district roads are paved.[322]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of Ho Chi Minh City's North-South Expressway](image)HCMC–LT–DG section of the North–South Expressway\n![Photograph of Tan Son Nhat International Airport](image)Tan Son Nhat International Airport is the busiest airport in the country.\nBicycles, motorcycles and motor scooters remain the most popular forms of road transport in the country, a legacy of the French, though the number of privately owned cars has been increasing in recent years.[323] Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population. Road accidents remain the major safety issue of Vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people losing their lives daily.[324] Traffic congestion is a growing problem in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City especially with the growth of individual car ownership.[325][326] Vietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, a distance of nearly 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi).[327] From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north, and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to Hạ Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Thái Nguyên, and the northeast line from Hanoi to Lào Cai. In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway—shinkansen (bullet train)—using Japanese technology.[328] Vietnamese engineers were sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains.[329] The planned railway will be a 1,545 kilometres (960 mi)-long express route serving a total of 23 stations, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with 70% of its route running on bridges and through tunnels.[330][331] The trains will travel at a maximum speed of 350 kilometres (220 mi) per hour.[331][332] Plans for the high-speed rail line, however, have been postponed after the Vietnamese government decided to prioritise the development of both the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City metros and expand road networks instead.[327][333][334]\n\n\n\n![Photograph if a crane at the Port of Hai Phong](image)The port of Hai Phong is one of the largest and busiest container ports in Vietnam.\nVietnam operates 20 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in Đà Nẵng and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Son Nhat is the country's largest airport handling the majority of international passenger traffic.[335] According to a government-approved plan, Vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2025, including Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, Can Tho International Airport, and Long Thanh International Airport. The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2025.[336] Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 86 passenger aircraft and aims to operate 170 by 2020.[337] Several private airlines also operate in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Bamboo Airways, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air. As a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including Cam Ranh, Đà Nẵng, Hải Phòng, Ho Chi Minh City, Hạ Long, Qui Nhơn, Vũng Tàu, Cửa Lò and Nha Trang. Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers plays a key role in rural transportation with over 47,130 kilometres (29,290 mi) of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.[338]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in Vietnam and List of power stations in Vietnam\n\n![Photograph of the Son La Dam](image)Sơn La Dam in northern Vietnam, the largest hydroelectric dam in Southeast Asia[339]\nVietnam's energy sector is dominated largely by the state-controlled Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN). As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country's power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW.[340] Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build–operate–transfer (BOT) investors.[341]\n\n\nMost of Vietnam's power is generated by either hydropower or fossil fuel power such as coal, oil and gas, while diesel, small hydropower and renewable energy supplies the remainder.[341] The Vietnamese government had planned to develop a nuclear reactor as the path to establish another source for electricity from nuclear power. The plan was abandoned in late 2016 when a majority of the National Assembly voted to oppose the project due to widespread public concern over radioactive contamination.[342]\n\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).[343] Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).[344]\n\n\nAccording to statistics from British Petroleum (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.[345]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Vietnam\n\nTelecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company.[346] The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986. The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it owned by VNPT.[346] VNPT's monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree.[347] By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone. The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone.[348] With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure.[349]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Vietnam\n\n![Stream flowing down a hill with a bridge crossing it](image)In rural areas of Vietnam, piped water systems are operated by a wide variety of institutions including a national organisation, people committees (local government), community groups, co-operatives and private companies.\nVietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m³. The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge.[350] Most of the country's urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years. Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse. Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed. It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply.[351] There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems. Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources. Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water.[351]\n\n\nIn recent years, there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to develop access to safe water in the country by introducing water filtration systems. There is a growing concern among local populations over the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well as the high levels of arsenic in groundwater sources.[352] The government of Netherlands has been providing aid focusing its investments mainly on water-related sectors including water treatment projects.[353][354][355] Regarding sanitation, 78% of Vietnam's population has access to \"improved\" sanitation—94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. However, there are still about 21 million people in the country lacking access to \"improved\" sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015.[356] In 2018, the construction ministry said the country's water supply, and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and information technology (IT) to sanitation issues but faced problems like limited funding, climate change, and pollution.[357] The health ministry has also announced that water inspection units will be established nationwide beginning in June 2019. Inspections are to be conducted without notice, since there have been many cases involving health issues caused by poor or polluted water supplies as well unhygienic conditions reported every year.[358]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Vietnam\n\n![](image)Development of life expectancy in Vietnam since 1950\nBy 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources.[359] In 2016, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births.[360][361][362] Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level.[363] After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established.[168] In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges.[290] Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry.[364] The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today.[365][366] For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam's land being defoliated.[367]\n\n\nSince the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria. The malaria mortality rate fell to about five per cent of its 1990s equivalent by 2005 after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment.[368] Tuberculosis (TB) cases, however, are on the rise. TB has become the second most infectious disease in the country after respiratory-related illness.[369] With an intensified vaccination program, better hygiene and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and new TB infections.[370] In 2004, government subsidies covering about 15% of health care expenses.[371] That year, the United States announced Vietnam would be one of 15 states to receive funding as part of its global AIDS relief plan.[372] By the following year, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); 9,554 have died.[373] The actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher. On average between 40 and 50 new infections are reported daily in the country. In 2007, 0.4% of the population was estimated to be infected with HIV and the figure has remained stable since 2005.[374] More global aid is being delivered through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to fight the spread of the disease in the country.[370] In September 2018, the Hanoi People's Committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating dog and cat meat as it can cause diseases like rabies and leptospirosis. More than 1,000 stores in the capital city of Hanoi were found to be selling both meats. The decision prompted positive comments among Vietnamese on social media, though some noted that the consumption of dog meat will remain an ingrained habit among many people.[375]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Vietnam\n\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions. General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities. A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008.[376] Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country's education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government. Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance.[377] Regardless, Vietnam's school enrolment is among the highest in the world.[378][379] The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005. In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them.[380][381]Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education.[382] A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (United States) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia). The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics. In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval. The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education.[383]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Vietnam, Vietnamese people, and Ethnic groups in Vietnam\n\n![](image)Vietnam population pyramid in 2019\nEthnic groups of Vietnam[384]\n\n\n\nVietnamese (85.32%)\nOther (14.68%)\n\nAs of 2021[update], the population of Vietnam stands at approximately 97.5 million people.[385] The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million.[386] According to the 2019 census, the country's population was 96,208,984.[2] Based on the 2019 census, 65.6% of the Vietnamese population live in rural areas while only 34.4% live in urban areas. The average growth rate of the urban population has recently increased which is attributed mainly to migration and rapid urbanisation.[2] The dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constitute 82,085,826 people or 85.32% of the population.[2] Most of their population is concentrated in the country's alluvial deltas and coastal plains. As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country.[384] Despite this, Vietnam is also home to various ethnic groups, of which 54 are officially recognised, including the Hmong, Dao, Tày, Thái and Nùng.[387] Many ethnic minorities such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh, dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.[388]\n\n\nSince the partition of Vietnam, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including more than 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas.[389][390] The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders.[384][391] Throughout Vietnam's history, many Chinese people, largely from South China, migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees.[392] Since the reunification in 1976, an increase of communist policies nationwide resulted in the nationalisation and confiscation of property especially from the Hoa in the south and the wealthy in cities. This led many of them to leave Vietnam.[393][394]\n\n\n\n### Urbanisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Vietnam\n\n![Ho Chi Minh City's District 1 skyline photographed at night](image)District 1, Ho Chi Minh City\nThe number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%).[2] Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the Đổi Mới economic program, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights. As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively.[395] The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census.[2] Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate.[396] Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.[397]\n\n\n\nPhotograph showing the large number of high-rise buildings in west HanoiUrbanisation in west Hanoi\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.[398] In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.[398] In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.[398]\n\n\nMany Vietnamese use mopeds for transportation, since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013.[398] With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water, for example in the 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster.[399] The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for waste handling. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government's efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort household waste, since waste sorting is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.[400]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities and municipalities in VietnamSource: 2019 Vietnamese census,[401] National Assembly[note 1]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Hanoi](image)Hanoi | 1 | Ho Chi Minh City | Municipality | 8,993,082 | 11 | Tân Uyên | Bình Dương | 466,053\n | ![Haiphong](image)Haiphong![Cần Thơ](image)Cần Thơ |\n| 2 | Hanoi | Municipality | 8,053,663 | 12 | Nha Trang | Khánh Hòa | 422,601\n |\n| 3 | Haiphong | Municipality | 2,028,514 | 13 | Dĩ An | Bình Dương | 403,760\n |\n| 4 | Cần Thơ | Municipality | 1,235,171 | 14 | Buôn Ma Thuột | Đắk Lắk | 375,590\n |\n| 5 | Da Nang | Municipality | 1,134,310 | 15 | Thanh Hóa | Thanh Hóa | 359,910\n |\n| 6 | Biên Hòa | Đồng Nai | 1,055,414 | 16 | Vũng Tàu | Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu | 357,124\n |\n| 7 | Thủ Đức | Ho Chi Minh City | 1,013,795 | 17 | Bến Cát | Bình Dương | 355,663\n |\n| 8 | Huế | Thừa Thiên Huế | 652,572 | 18 | Thái Nguyên | Thái Nguyên | 340,403\n |\n| 9 | Thuận An | Bình Dương | 508,433 | 19 | Vinh | Nghệ An | 339,114\n |\n| 10 | Hải Dương | Hải Dương | 508,190 | 20 | Thủ Dầu Một | Bình Dương | 321,607\n |\n1. **^** Some cities were established or expanded after the 2019 census was conducted, including Thủ Đức,[402] Huế,[403] Thuận An,[404] Hải Dương,[405] Dĩ An,[404] and Hạ Long.[406]\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Vietnam\n\nReligion in Vietnam (2019)[2]\n\n\n\nVietnamese folk religion or no religion (86.32%)\nBuddhism (4.79%)\nCatholicism (6.1%)\nProtestantism (1.0%)\nHoahaoism (1.02%)\nCaodaism (0.58%)\nIslam (0.07%)\nOthers (0.12%)\n\nUnder Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy freedom of belief and religion.[407] All religions are equal before the law and each place of worship is protected under Vietnamese state law. Religious beliefs cannot be misused to undermine state law and policies.[407][408] According to a 2007 survey 81% of Vietnamese people did not believe in a god.[409] Based on government findings in 2009, the number of religious people increased by 932,000.[410] The official statistics, presented by the Vietnamese government to the United Nations special rapporteur in 2014, indicate the overall number of followers of recognised religions is about 24 million of a total population of almost 90 million.[411] According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam in 2019, Buddhists account for 4.79% of the total population, Catholics 6.1%, Protestants 1.0%, Hoahao Buddhists 1.02%, and Caodaism followers 0.58%.[2] Other religions includes Islam, Bahaʼís and Hinduism, representing less than 0.2% of the population.\n\n\nThe majority of Vietnamese do not follow any organised religion, though many of them observe some form of Vietnamese folk religion. Confucianism as a system of social and ethical philosophy still has certain influences in modern Vietnam. Mahāyāna is the dominant branch of Buddhism, while Theravāda is practised mostly by the Khmer minority. About 8 to 9% of the population is Christian—made up of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Catholicism was introduced to Vietnam in the 16th century and was firmly established by Jesuits missionaries (mainly Portuguese and Italian) in the 17th centuries from nearby Portuguese Macau.[72] French missionaries (from the Paris Foreign Missions Society) together with Spanish missionaries (from the Dominican Order of the neighbouring Spanish East Indies) actively sought converts in the 18th, 19th, and first half of the 20th century.[412][413][414] A significant number of Vietnamese people, especially in the South, are also adherents of two indigenous religions of syncretic Caodaism and quasi-Buddhist Hoahaoism.[415] Protestantism was only recently spread by American and Canadian missionaries in the 20th century;[416] the largest Protestant denomination is the Evangelical Church of Vietnam. Around 770,000 of the country's Protestants are members of ethnic minorities,[416] particularly the highland Montagnards[417] and Hmong people. Although it is one of the country's minority religions, Protestantism is the fastest-growing religion in Vietnam, expanding at a rate of 600% in recent decades.[416][418] Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam, these include: Bani, Sunni and non-denominational sections of Islam which is practised primarily among the ethnic Cham minority.[419] There are also a few Kinh adherents of Islam, other minority adherents of Baha'i, as well as Hindus among the Cham's.[420][421]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nThe national language of the country is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon–Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population. Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: Tày, Mường, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, Nùng and Hmong. The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families.[422] In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.\n\n\n\n![A sample of traditional Vietnamese calligraphy](image)Vietnamese calligraphy in Latin alphabet\nThe French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among the older generation and those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce. Vietnam remains a full member of the International Organisation of the Francophonie (*La Francophonie*) and education has revived some interest in the language.[423] Russian, and to a lesser extent German, Czech and Polish are known among some northern Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.[424] With improved relations with Western countries and recent reforms in Vietnamese administration, English has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of English is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of French.[425][426] The popularity of Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese have also grown as the country's ties with other East Asian nations have strengthened.[427][428][429] Third-graders can choose one of seven languages (English, Russian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German) as their first foreign language.[430][431][432] In Vietnam's high school graduation examinations, students can take their foreign language exam in one of the above-mentioned languages.[433]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Vietnam\n\n![The Temple of Literature in Hanoi](image)\nThe Temple of Literature in Hanoi\n![The Meridian Gate (Huế)](image)\nThe Imperial City of Huế\n![The Municipal Theatre in Ho Chi Minh City](image)\nThe Municipal Theatre (Saigon Opera House) in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nVietnamese culture is considered part of Sinosphere. Vietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient Đông Sơn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base.[37][40] Some elements of the nation's culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, Mahāyāna Buddhism, and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy.[434][435] Vietnamese society is structured around *làng* (ancestral villages);[436] all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month.[437][438] The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture.[439] Despite this, there are Chinatowns in the south, such as in Chợ Lớn, where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them.[440] In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Huỳnh culture.[441][442] In recent centuries, Western cultures have become popular among recent generations of Vietnamese.[435]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of two girls wearing a traditional Vietnamese white school uniform, the áo dài—both are holding the nón lá, a conical hat](image)Vietnamese traditional white school uniform for girls in the country, the *áo dài* with the addition of *nón lá*, a conical hat\nThe traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are based on humanity (*nhân nghĩa*) and harmony (*hòa*) in which family and community values are highly regarded.[439] Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols,[443] such as the Vietnamese dragon which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery; Vietnam's national father, Lạc Long Quân is depicted as a holy dragon.[437][444][445] The *lạc* is a holy bird representing Vietnam's national mother Âu Cơ. Other prominent images that are also revered are the turtle, buffalo and horse.[446] Many Vietnamese also believe in the supernatural and spiritualism where illness can be brought on by a curse or sorcery or caused by non-observance of a religious ethic. Traditional medical practitioners, amulets and other forms of spiritual protection and religious practices may be employed to treat the ill person.[447] In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programs.[435] For many decades, foreign cultural influences, especially those of Western origin, were shunned. But since the recent reformation, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to neighbouring Southeast Asian, East Asian as well to Western culture and media.[448]\n\n\nThe main Vietnamese formal dress, the *áo dài* is worn for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals. White *áo dài* is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across the country. Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include: the *áo tứ thân*, a four-piece woman's dress; the *áo ngũ*, a form of the *thân* in five-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the *yếm*, a woman's undergarment; the *áo bà ba*, rural working \"pyjamas\" for men and women; the *áo gấm*, a formal brocade tunic for government receptions; and the *áo the*, a variant of the *áo gấm* worn by grooms at weddings.[449][450] Traditional headwear includes the standard conical *nón lá* and the \"lampshade-like\" *nón quai thao*.[450][451] In tourism, a number of popular cultural tourist destinations include the former Imperial City of Huế, the World Heritage Sites of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park, Hội An and Mỹ Sơn, coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of Hạ Long Bay and the Marble Mountains.[452][453]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vietnamese literature, Vietnamese poetry, Vietnamese mythology, and Vietnamese fairy tales\n\n![A scroll showing a Vietnamese dragon](image)Vietnamese dragon on Emperor Khải Định's c. 1917 scroll in British Library collection\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six–to-eight-verse poetic form called *ca dao* which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes.[454] Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ngô dynasty, with notable ancient authors including: Nguyễn Trãi, Trần Hưng Đạo, Nguyễn Du and Nguyễn Đình Chiểu. Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as *hát nói* in *ca trù*.[455] Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the *tao đàn*. Vietnamese literature has been influenced by Western styles in recent times, with the first literary transformation movement of *thơ mới* emerging in 1932.[456] Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms. It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed). Folk literature usually exists in many versions, passed down orally, and has unknown authors. Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life.[457] They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (*Lạc Long Quân* and *Âu Cơ*), culture heroes (*Sơn Tinh* and *Thủy Tinh*) which are referred to as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales.[440][458]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Vietnam\n\n![Three musicians are performing on a stage.](image)*Ca trù* trio performance in northern Vietnam\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions.[459] Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal. The origins of Vietnamese classical music can be traced to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe.[460] Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition along with those of Japan, Korea and Mongolia.[461] *Nhã nhạc* is the most popular form of imperial court music, *Chèo* is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, while *Xẩm* or *hát xẩm* (*xẩm* singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music. *Quan họ* (alternate singing) is popular in the former Hà Bắc Province (which is now divided into Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang Provinces) and across Vietnam. Another form of music called *Hát chầu văn* or *hát văn* is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies. *Nhạc dân tộc cải biên* is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s, while *ca trù* (also known as *hát ả đào*) is a popular folk music. *Hò* can be thought of as the southern style of *Quan họ*. There is a range of traditional instruments, including the *đàn bầu* (a monochord zither), the *đàn gáo* (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the *đàn nguyệt* (a two-stringed fretted moon lute). In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music—especially folk music—with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles.[462] Bolero music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style—a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements.[463] In the 21st century, the modern Vietnamese pop music industry known as V-pop incorporates elements of many popular genres worldwide, such as electronic, dance and R&B.[464][465]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vietnamese cuisine\n\n![Photographs of a phở noodle dish, a chè thái fruit dessert, a chả giò spring roll and a bánh mì sandwich](image)Some of the notable Vietnamese cuisine, clockwise from top-right: *phở* noodle, *chè* fruit dessert, *chả giò* spring roll, and *bánh mì* sandwich\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" (Vietnamese: *ngũ vị*): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth).[466] Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime and basil leaves.[467] Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.[468] The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past. Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country.[469] Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as *gỏi cuốn* (salad roll), *bánh cuốn* (rice noodle roll), *bún riêu* (rice vermicelli soup) and *phở* noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants.[470][471] Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices.[472] Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include *cà phê đá* (Vietnamese iced coffee), *cà phê trứng* (egg coffee), *chanh muối* (salted pickled lime juice), *cơm rượu* (glutinous rice wine), *nước mía* (sugarcane juice) and *trà sen* (Vietnamese lotus tea).[473]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Vietnam\n\n![Shown is the logo of the state broadcaster Vietnam Television.](image)Vietnam Television (VTV), the main state television station\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication.[474] It is generally perceived that the country's media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken.[475][476] The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"Bamboo Firewall\".[477] The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\",[478] while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\".[479] Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked.[480]\n\n\n\n### Holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Vietnam and List of traditional festivals in Vietnam\n\n![A large round white fabric band decorated with red figures and images for Tết](image)Special *Tết* decoration in the country seen during the holiday\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays. These include: New Year's Day on 1 January; Vietnamese New Year (*Tết Nguyên Đán*) from the last day of the last lunar month to fifth day of the first lunar month; Hùng Kings' Festival on the 10th day of the third lunar month; Reunification Day on 30 April; International Workers' Day on 1 May; and National Day on 2 September.[481][482][483] During *Tết*, many Vietnamese from the major cities will return to their villages for family reunions and to pray for dead ancestors.[484][485] Older people will usually give the young a *lì xì* (red envelope) while special holiday food, such as *bánh chưng* (rice cake) in a square shape together with variety of dried fruits, are presented in the house for visitors.[486] Many other festivals are celebrated throughout the seasons, including the *Tết Nguyên Tiêu*, *Tết Trung Thu* and various temple and nature festivals.[487] In the highlands, Elephant Race Festivals are held annually during the spring; riders will ride their elephants for about 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and the winning elephant will be given sugarcane.[488] Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular.[489]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in Vietnam and List of Vietnamese traditional games\n\n![](image)Mỹ Đình National Stadium in Hanoi\nThe Vovinam, *Kim Kê* and *Võ Bình Định* are widespread in Vietnam,[490][491] while football is the country's most popular sport.[492] Its national team won the ASEAN Football Championship twice in 2008 and 2018 and reached the quarter-finals of 2019 AFC Asian Cup,[493][494][495] its junior team of under-23 became the runners-up of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship and reached fourth place in 2018 Asian Games, while the under-20 managed to qualify the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time in their football history.[496][497] The national football women's team also traditionally dominates the Southeast Asian Games, along with its chief rival, Thailand. Other Western sports such as badminton, tennis, volleyball, ping-pong and chess are also widely popular. Vietnam has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1952. After the partition of the country in 1954, only South Vietnam competed in the games, sending athletes to the 1956 and 1972 Olympics. Since the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, it has competed as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, attending every Summer Olympics from 1988 onwards. The present Vietnam Olympic Committee was formed in 1976 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979.[498] Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games. In 2016, Vietnam won their first gold medal at the Olympics.[499] Basketball has become an increasingly popular sport in Vietnam, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Sóc Trăng.[500]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Index of Vietnam-related articles\n* Outline of Vietnam\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In effect since 1 January 2014.[4]\n2. **^** The spelling \"Viet Nam\" or the full Vietnamese form \"Việt Nam\" is sometimes used in English by local and government-operated media. \"Viet Nam\" is, in fact, formally designated and recognized by the Government of Vietnam, the United Nations and the International Organization for Standardization as the standardized country name.

The plan, however, was rejected by Soviet and other communist delegations.[115]\n6. **^** See List of countries and dependencies by area.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Vietnam\". *The World Factbook*.
