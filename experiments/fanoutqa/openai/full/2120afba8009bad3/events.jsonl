It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and the first chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Return of the Jedi* (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997—at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert—and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was released in theaters on May 19, 1999, almost 16 years after the premiere of *Return of the Jedi*. The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly Jar Jar Binks—received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. *Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *The Phantom Menace*, rounding out the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe Trade Federation upsets order in the Galactic Republic by blockading the planet Naboo in secret preparation for a full-scale invasion. The Republic's leader, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, dispatches Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord and the Trade Federation's secret benefactor, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of battle droids. The Jedi escape and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, Qui-Gon rescues a bumbling Gungan outcast, Jar Jar Binks. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, the Gungans' underwater city. The Jedi fail to persuade the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, to help the planet's surface dwellers, but manage to obtain Jar Jar's guidance and underwater transport to Theed, the capital city of Naboo. After rescuing Queen Padmé Amidala, the group makes their escape from Naboo aboard her Royal Starship, intending to reach the Republic capital planet of Coruscant.\n\n\nPassing through the Federation blockade, the ship is damaged in the crossfire, and its hyperdrive malfunctions. The group land for repairs on the outlying desert planet of Tatooine, situated beyond the Republic's jurisdiction. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, astromech droid R2-D2, and Padmé—disguised as one of her handmaidens—visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase a new part for their hyperdrive. They encounter a junk dealer, Watto, and his nine-year-old slave, Anakin Skywalker, a gifted pilot and engineer who has built a protocol droid, C-3PO.\nQui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within Anakin and is convinced that he is the prophesied \"Chosen One,\" destined to restore balance to the Force. With Watto refusing to accept payment in Republic currency, Qui-Gon wagers both the required hyperdrive part and Anakin's freedom in a podrace. Anakin wins the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving behind his mother, Shmi. En route to their starship, Qui-Gon is attacked by Darth Maul, Sidious' apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. After a brief lightsaber duel, Qui-Gon escapes on board the starship with the others.\n\n\nQui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Padmé to Coruscant so that she can plead her people's case to Valorum and the Galactic Senate. Qui-Gon reports to the Jedi Council about the Sith and he requests permission to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses, concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows to take up Anakin as his new apprentice. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to call for a vote of no confidence in Valorum to elect a more capable leader and to resolve the crisis. Though she is successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and decides to return to Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen and investigate the return of the Sith, whom they had believed to be extinct for more than a millennium.\n\n\nOn Naboo, Padmé reveals herself as the queen before the Gungans and persuades them to join in an alliance against the Trade Federation. Jar Jar is promoted to general and joins his tribe in a battle against the droid army, while Padmé leads the search for Gunray in Theed. During a battle in the hangar, Anakin flees to a starfighter and accidentally triggers its autopilot, traveling to a space battle against the Federation droid control ship and inadvertently causing its destruction from within, deactivating the droid army. Meanwhile, Darth Maul engages Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel. Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon before being bisected by Obi-Wan and falling down a shaft.[c] Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin before dying in his arms.\n\n\nFollowing the battle, Gunray is arrested by the Republic and Palpatine is elected Chancellor. Grandmaster Yoda promotes Obi-Wan to the rank of Jedi Knight and reluctantly accepts Anakin as Obi-Wan's apprentice. A funeral is held for Qui-Gon, attended by the other Jedi, who contemplate that there are only two Sith at any given time; a master and an apprentice. At a celebratory parade on Naboo, Padmé presents a gift of thanks to Boss Nass and the Gungans to establish peace.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Liam Neeson](image)\n![A photograph of Ewan McGregor](image)\n![A photograph of Natalie Portman](image)\nLeft to right: Liam Neeson (pictured in 2012), Ewan McGregor (2012) and Natalie Portman (2015)\n\n* Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who discovers Anakin Skywalker and under the belief that he is destined to bring balance to the force as the prophesied \"Chosen One\", insists that the boy be trained as a Jedi, despite the Jedi Council's refusal to do so. Lucas originally wanted to cast an American actor in the role, but cast Neeson (who is Northern Irish) because he considered that Neeson had great skills and presence. Lucas said Neeson was a \"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\"[3]\n* Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's twenty-five-year-old Jedi Padawan, who holds his master in high regard but questions his motives at times, especially when it seems he is breaking the rules of the Jedi. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, all of whom had to be compared to pictures of young Alec Guinness, who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a believable younger version.[4] McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness's. He also studied several of Guinness's performances, from his early work and the original *Star Wars* films.[3]\n* Natalie Portman as Padmé Amidala, the fourteen-year-old Queen of Naboo, who hopes to protect her planet from the Trade Federation's blockade invasion. Throughout most of the film, she uses her birth name Padmé Naberrie and poses as one of the queen's handmaidens for protection. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role.[5] The production notes stated that \"The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open\". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in *Léon: The Professional* (1994) and *Beautiful Girls* (1996), which impressed Lucas.[3] He stated, \"I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [and] Natalie embodied all those traits and more\".[3] Portman was unfamiliar with *Star Wars* before being cast,[3] but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, \"It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I think it will be good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader.\"[6]\n* Jake Lloyd as Anakin \"Ani\" Skywalker, a nine-year-old slave boy and a skilled pilot who dreams of becoming a Jedi. Hundreds of actors were tested across the UK, Ireland, Canada and the United States[3] before the producers settled on Lloyd, who Lucas considered met his requirements of \"a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic\". Producer Rick McCallum said that Lloyd was \"smart, mischievous, and loves anything mechanical—just like Anakin.\"[7]\n* Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, a middle-aged senator of Naboo and a secret Sith Lord who orchestrates the invasion of his home planet to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He is the Trade Federation's mysterious benefactor, and the titular \"Phantom Menace\". McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him sixteen years after *Return of the Jedi* to reprise the role of Palpatine, having assumed that a younger actor would play the role in the prequel films.[8]\n* Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, a clumsy Gungan exiled from his home and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting director Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco.[7] Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data, but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character.[9] Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.[7]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, a protocol droid built by Anakin. He lacks a metal covering in this film; R2-D2 humorously refers to it as being \"naked\". Industrial Light & Magic's Michael Lynch, dressed in a color closely matching the background—in a manner similar to the Japanese puppet theater Bunraku— manipulated a skeletal C-3PO figure attached to his front while Daniels read his lines off-camera. The puppeteer was erased from the film during post-production.[7][10]\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid from Naboo that saves Queen Amidala's ship when other astro droids fail. Before the film's production started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would reprise the role. Baker is used for scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side-to-side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.[*citation needed*]\n* Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother, who is concerned for her son's future and allows him to leave with the Jedi. August, a veteran of Swedish cinema, was chosen after auditioning with Liam Neeson. She was afraid of being rejected because of her accent.[9]\n* Frank Oz as Yoda, the centuries-old Jedi Grandmaster and head of the Jedi Council who is apprehensive about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth, and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls.[9] Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted *In & Out*.[11] A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis (who played the part of the Ewok Wicket W. Warrick in *Return of the Jedi* in 1983) portrays him in the scene where Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight.[12] Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough at the time. Beginning with the 2011 Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda replaced the puppet entirely.[13]\n* Oliver Ford Davies as Sio Bibble, the governor of Naboo.[*citation needed*]\n* Hugh Quarshie as Captain Quarsh Panaka, Queen Amidala's chief of security at the Theed Palace.[*citation needed*]\n* Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, a Jedi Master and high-ranking member of the Jedi Council who opposes training Anakin.\n* Ray Park as Darth Maul, Darth Sidious's Zabrak Sith apprentice, who wields a double-bladed lightsaber\n\t+ Peter Serafinowicz as the voice of Darth Maul[9]\n* Terence Stamp as Finis Valorum, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic who commissions Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to negotiate with the Trade Federation viceroy. Lucas described the character as a \"good man but he's beleaguered—a bit like [Bill] Clinton\".[14]\n* Keira Knightley as Sabé, one of Queen Amidala's handmaidens who serves as her decoy throughout the majority of the film.[*citation needed*]\n* Silas Carson as:[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Nute Gunray, the viceroy of the Trade Federation who leads Naboo's invasion and tries to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty to legitimize their occupation of the planet.\n\t+ Ki-Adi-Mundi, a wise and powerful Jedi Master who sits on the council.\n\t+ Lott Dod, a Trade Federation Senator.\n\t+ An ill-fated pilot. This was the role for which Carson originally auditioned.[15]\n* Jerome St. John Blake as:[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Rune Haako, Gunray's chief lieutenant and Settlement Officer in the Trade Federation.\n\t\t- James Taylor as the voice of Rune Haako.[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Oppo Rancisis, a Jedi Master and member of the council.\n\t+ Orn Free Taa, a Twi-lek senator.\n\t+ Mas Amedda, a Chagrian politician and Vice Chair of the galactic senate.\n\n\nAdditionally, Brian Blessed voiced Boss Nass, the leader of the Gungan tribe who allies with the Naboo surface dwellers; Andy Secombe voiced Watto, a junk dealer on Tatooine who owns Anakin and his mother as slaves; and Lewis MacLeod voiced Sebulba, an aggressive, scheming podracer who is Anakin's main rival at the Boonta Eve podrace. Greg Proops and Scott Capurro voiced Fode and Beed, respectively, the two-headed announcer of the Boonta Eve Race. Alan Ruscoe appears as Jedi Master Plo Koon and Neimoidian Daultay Dofine, commander of the Trade Federation's droid control ships. Ralph Brown plays Ric Olie, commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps and chief pilot aboard Queen Amidala's starship, while Matthew Wood appears as the Twi'lek Bib Fortuna alongside a CGI Jabba the Hutt, who is voiced by Scott Schumann. Dominic West plays the role of an unnamed Naboo guard, and Sofia Coppola appears as Saché, one of Amidala's handmaidens. Christian Simpson appears as Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes.[16] Lindsay Duncan voices TC-14, a protocol droid on the Federation ship. Sally Hawkins made her screen debut as an uncredited villager.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWhile writing the original *Star Wars* film,[b] Lucas decided the story was too vast to be covered in one film. He introduced a wider story arc that could be told in sequels if it became successful.[17][18] He negotiated a contract that allowed him to make two sequels, and over time created an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.[19] While writing the second film *The Empire Strikes Back*, Lucas considered directions in which to take the story. In the original trilogy, Darth Vader was revealed to have been Anakin Skywalker, a once-powerful Jedi Knight, and a traitor to the Jedi Order.[20] With this backstory in place, Lucas decided that the movies would work best as a trilogy.[21] In the trilogy's final episode, *Return of the Jedi*, Vader is redeemed through an act of sacrifice for Luke.[22]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Lucas said he had no desire to return to *Star Wars* and had canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of *Return of the Jedi*. However, because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him.[23] In the early 1990s, *Star Wars* saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw that there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy, and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film.[24] In October 1993, it was announced in *Variety* and other sources that he would be making the prequels.[25] Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the protagonist, and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. A relic of the original outline was that Anakin would, like his son, grow up on Tatooine.[26] Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series; instead of filling in the tangential history, they would form the beginning of a long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.[27]\n\n\nLucas began writing the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy on November 1, 1994. The screenplay of *Star Wars* was adapted from Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him keep track of the characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy.[28] Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt that the lower age would better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes.[29] The film's working title was *The Beginning*, with the title not being changed to *The Phantom Menace* until shortly before the film's completion.[28] Lucas later revealed that the *Phantom Menace* title was a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.[30]\n\n\nThe larger budget and possibilities opened up by the use of digital effects made Lucas \"think about a much grander, more epic scale—\"which is what I wanted *Star Wars* to be\".[31] The story ended with five simultaneous, ongoing plots, one leading to another. The central plot is Palpatine's intent to become Chancellor, which leads to the Trade Federation's attack on Naboo, the Jedi being sent there, Anakin being met along the way, and the rise of the Sith Lords. As with the original trilogy, Lucas intended *The Phantom Menace* to illustrate several themes throughout the narrative. Duality is a frequent theme; Amidala is a queen who passes as a handmaiden, Palpatine plays on both sides of the war, among others. \"Balance\" is frequently suggested; Anakin is supposedly \"the one\" chosen to bring balance to the Force—Lucas said, \"Anakin needed to have a mother, Obi-Wan needed a Master, Darth Sidious needed an apprentice\" as without interaction and dialogue, \"you wouldn't have drama\".[32]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Ron Howard confirmed that he, Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg were approached by Lucas to direct *The Phantom Menace*. All three approached directors told Lucas that he should direct the film, as they each found the project \"too daunting.\"[33]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production and design[edit]\n\n\nBefore Lucas had started writing, his producing partner Rick McCallum was preparing for the film. McCallum stated that his experience with *The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles* led to many of his decisions on *The Phantom Menace*, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, and the creation of sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.[34][35] Art development on the film began in January 1995.[36]\n\n\nWithin three to four months of Lucas beginning the writing process, Chiang and his design team started a two-year process of reviewing thousands of designs for the film.[37] Chiang stated that Lucas intended *Episode I* to be stylistically different from the other *Star Wars* films; it would be \"richer and more like a period piece, since it was the history leading up to *A New Hope*.\" The story takes place on three planets, some with varied environments such as the human and Gungan cities of Naboo and three buildings in Coruscant. With the exception of the Gungan city, which had an art nouveau-inspired visual, these locations would be given distinctive looks with some basis in the real world. The concept drawings of Ralph McQuarrie for the original trilogy served as the basis for Mos Espa—which was also inspired by old Tunisian hotels and buildings and had touches such as a marketplace to differentiate it from *A New Hope*'s Mos Eisley—and Coruscant, in particular a metropolis design that became the basis for the Senate.[38] Bocquet would later develop the work of Chiang's team and design the interiors, translating the concepts into construction blueprints with environments and architectural styles that had some basis in reality \"to give the audience something to key into.\"[39] Some elements were directly inspired by the original trilogy; Lucas described the battle droids as predecessors to the stormtroopers. Chiang uses that orientation to base the droids on the Imperial soldiers, only in the same style of stylized and elongated features seen in tribal African art.[31]\n\n\nTerryl Whitlatch, who had a background on zoology and anatomy, was in charge of creature design. Many of the aliens are hybrids, combining features of real animals. At times, entire food chains were developed, even though only a small percentage of them would appear in the film. Whitlatch also designed detailed skeletons for the major characters and facial muscles on Jar Jar Binks as a reference for ILM's animators. Each creature would reflect its environment; those on Naboo were more beautiful because the planet is \"lush and more animal-friendly\", Tatooine has rough-looking creatures \"with weather-beaten leathery skin to protect them from the harsh desert elements\", and Coruscant has bipedal, human-looking aliens.[40]\n\n\nThe film made extensive use of the new technique of digital pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create 3-D animated storyboards. This was done for dozens of scenes in the film but was first and primarily used in the pod race sequence. Animatic supervisor David Dozoretz, also an ILM alum, worked on this sequence for nearly three years, and at one point had a 25-minute version of the race, although the film only included a 9-minute version.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![Three men fight with laser swords in an hangar.](image)Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling Darth Maul. Lucas wanted the lightsaber battles to be fast and more intense than those of the original trilogy, depicting the Jedi in their prime. This scene was highly praised by critics and audiences.\nStunt coordinator Nick Gillard was recruited to create a new Jedi fighting style for the prequel trilogy. Gillard likened the lightsaber battles to a chess game \"with every move being a check\". Because of their short-range weapons, Gillard thought that the Jedi would have had to develop a fighting style that merged every sword fighting style, such as kendo and other kenjutsu styles, with other swinging techniques, such as tennis swings and tree-chopping. While training Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, Gillard wrote a sequence that lasted around 60 seconds and intended to be around five or six sequences per fight.[41] Lucas later referred to the Jedi as \"negotiators\" rather than high-casualty soldiers. The preference of hand-to-hand combat was intended to give a spiritual and intellectual role to the Jedi.[41] Because Gillard thought that the stunt jumps with the actors and stuntmen dangling from wires did not look realistic, air rams were used to propel them into the air instead.[42]\n\n\nLucas decided to make elaborate costumes, because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures.[43] Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed *A New Hope* with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore \"a leathery look, like their skin\". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film;[44] Obi-Wan's costume was inspired by the costume that was worn by Guinness. Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to \"translat[e] all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly\". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure that the costumes would accommodate action scenes, and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics \"wouldn't wear too heavily\" on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.[45]\n\n\nNute Gunray's Thai accent was chosen after Lucas and McCallum listened to various languages to decide how the Neimoidians would speak.[46] The character design of Watto was an amalgam of rejected ideas; his expressions were based on video footage of Secombe's voice acting, photographs of animation supervisor Rob Coleman imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto's lines to a mirror.[47] Lucas described Sebulba's design as \"a spider crossed with an orangutan crossed with a sloth\",[48] with a camel-like face, and clothing inspired by medieval armor.[49]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nAfter Samuel L. Jackson expressed interest in appearing in a *Star Wars* film, he was approached by casting director Robin Gurland to play Mace Windu.[7] Jackson was originally slated to play Grando Calrissian, the father of *The Empire Strikes Back* character Lando Calrissian, but that character was dropped when Jackson signed on to play Windu instead.[50] Rapper Tupac Shakur was also considered for the role of Mace Windu.[51] Ray Park, a martial arts champion with experience in gymnastics and sword fighting, was originally a member of the stunt crew.[7] Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard filmed Park to demonstrate his conception of the lightsaber battles. Lucas and McCallum were so impressed with the test tape that they gave Park the role of Maul. His voice was considered \"too squeaky\" and was dubbed over in post-production by Peter Serafinowicz.[9] Keira Knightley's parents tried to convince her not to audition, but the teenage actress still sought a role since she was a *Star Wars* fan.[52] The casting was influenced by Knightley's remarkable similarity to Natalie Portman, with the actress admitting their mothers could not tell them apart.[53] Knightley was reported to have \"cried every single day\" due to finding the wardrobe uncomfortable.[52]\n\n\nOver 3,000 actors auditioned for the role of Anakin Skywalker including Haley Joel Osment, Cameron Finley, Justin Berfield and Michael Angarano before Jake Lloyd was selected.[54] Vinette Robinson auditioned for the role of Padmé Amidala.[55] Benicio del Toro was originally cast as Darth Maul but later left the project when the character's lines were cut.[56] Michael Jackson expressed interest in playing Jar Jar Binks, but he wanted to do it in prosthetic make ups while George Lucas wanted to do it in CGI.[57] Joseph Fiennes auditioned for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi and nearly landed the part until George Lucas's young daughter rejected him upon meeting him during the second level of auditioning.[58]\n\n\nSilas Carson was cast as Nute Gunray because another actor was uncomfortable with the costumes used by the Trade Federation characters, which were hot, exerted a lot of pressure on the bearer, and took about 15 minutes to apply. Hugh Quarshie considered the part of Panaka as \"a good career move\" and a production that would be fun to make.[59] Brian Blessed originally auditioned for the role of Sio Bibble, the Governor of Naboo,[60] for which he was considered \"too loud\".[61] Casting director Robin Gurland approached him to play Nass because it was a \"bigger than life\" character with \"a kind of bravado\".[62] Blessed described Nass as a \"reluctant hero\".[61] Sofia Coppola, daughter of Lucas' long-time friend and creative partner Francis Ford Coppola, considers Lucas as \"like an uncle to me\". As she prepared the script for her directorial debut *The Virgin Suicides*, Coppola heard Lucas would be making a new *Star Wars* film and asked him if she could accompany him during filming. Lucas offered Coppola a role in the royal entourage, which she accepted because it \"seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way\".[63]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars filming locations\n\n![Rocky buildings and an antenna-like structure in a desert.](image)Remains of Mos Espa in the Tunisian desert, near Nafta\nFilming began on June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, primarily taking place at Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a two and a half year period so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed.[64] The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire.[65][66] Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998.[67] Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.[42]\n\n\nThe Tunisian desert was again used for the Tatooine scenes;[68] Mos Espa was built outside the city of Tozeur. On the night following the third day of shooting in Tozeur, an unexpected sandstorm destroyed many of the sets and props. The production was quickly rescheduled to allow for repairs and was able to leave Tunisia on the date originally planned.[69] The Italian Caserta Palace was used as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace;[68] it was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palace of Caserta, in Italy, was the location for the Naboo Royal Palace.\nA binder with the film's storyboards served as a reference for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tattersall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.[71]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was the final *Star Wars* film to be shot on 35mm film until *The Force Awakens* (2015). Some scenes, mostly of elements filmed by the special effects team, were shot on high definition digital video tapes to test the performance of digital recordings, which Lucas and McCallum considered the next logical step because of the amount of digitizing—an expensive process compared to recording directly on digital media—for the compositing of computer-generated effects. A couple of digitally shot scenes made it into the movie, one of them being of Qui-Gon taking a blood sample of Anakin Skywalker.[72] All future films would be shot using Sony CineAlta high-definition video cameras.[73][74] Greg Proops and Scott Capurro were filmed wearing makeup and blue bodysuits so their heads could be joined in a computer-generated body. The visual effects crew did not like the original results and crafted Fode and Beed as an entirely computer generated alien.[75]\n\n\nBecause of the amount of visual effects produced, editing took two years; Paul Martin Smith started the process in England and focused on dialogue-heavy scenes. Ben Burtt—who was also the film's sound editor—was responsible for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. Non-linear editing systems played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999, and the following month, the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.[76]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"Writing the script was much more enjoyable this time around because I wasn't constrained by anything. You can't write one of these movies without knowing how you're going to accomplish it. With CG at my disposal, I knew I could do whatever I wanted\".\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n —George Lucas[77]\n\nThe film saw a breakthrough in computer generated effects. About 1,950 of the shots in *The Phantom Menace* have visual effects. The scene in which toxic gas is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration.[48] The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselves—John Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.[78]\n\n\nUntil the film's production, many special effects in the film industry were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings and on-set visual effects—although other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those that would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, he did not know how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation.[79] Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes.[48] Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.[80]\n\n\nLucas, who had previously confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department to create their own versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving 440 pounds (200 kg), enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.[81]\n\n\nLucas originally planned to create many of the aliens with computer graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimoidians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.[82]\n\n\nTo research for the podrace vehicles, the visual effects crew visited a jet aircraft junkyard outside Phoenix, Arizona and scavenged four Boeing 747 engines.[48] Life-sized replicas of the engines were built and sent to Tunisia to provide reference in the film. Except for Jake Lloyd inside a hydraulically controlled cockpit and a few practical podracer models, the entire podracing scene—which the effects crew designed to be as \"out of this world\" as possible—is computer-generated.[68][83]\n\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\nLike previous *Star Wars* films, *The Phantom Menace* makes several references to historical events and films that George Lucas watched in his youth. The *Star Wars* films typically mix several concepts from different mythologies together, drawing heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[84] The film also notably borrows from *Ben-Hur* (1959), including the podrace sequence, which mirrors the chariot race scene; additionally, the end celebration scene closely resembles a Roman parade in *Ben-Hur*.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The face of Darth Maul drew upon depictions of the devil.\nThere are many references to Christianity in the film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil, complete with red skin and horns.[84] The *Star Wars* film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the \"Chosen One\"—the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force—who was conceived of a virgin birth. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin will eventually fall from grace and seemingly fail to fulfill his destiny (until the prophecy comes true in *Return of the Jedi*).[86]\n\n\nJapanese films such as Akira Kurosawa's *The Hidden Fortress* (1958) influenced the original *Star Wars* film; scholars say that *The Phantom Menace* was likewise influenced by Korean and Japanese culture. Film historians Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska write, \"The costume and make-up designs ... favour a mixture of the gothic and the oriental over anything very futuristic. The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons.\" King and Krzywinska say that \"Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading in terms of the Samurai tradition\". They also say \"Amidala, in keeping with her status and character, has a number of highly formal outfits ... to go with hair sculpted into a curve that frames make-up of a Japanese cast\".[87]\n\n\nThe Jedi practice Zen-like meditation and martial arts, as did the ancient Japanese Samurai warriors. The name \"Qui-Gon\" adapts the term qigong, which refers to a Chinese discipline involving meditation and cultivation of the flow of the vital energy called \"*qi*\" for healing, health, and combat. The words *qi* (Chinese), *gi* (Korean), *ki* (Japanese), and the Indian term \"Prana\" all refer to the energy that is thought to flow through all living things, from the source of all *qi* (or power), which is \"The Way\" or \"The Tao\" in Chinese philosophy. In Taoist philosophy, from The Way, yin and yang—the opposing but complementary aspects of reality or nature—are born. Unlike Chinese philosophy, in which yin and yang are not moral qualities, the ancient Persian philosophy of Zurvanism taught that the dualism of dark and light forces are locked in an eternal battle while being two sides (or evolutes) of the same \"Force\", the force of time itself (Zurvan)—the prime mover. These elements derive primarily from Eastern and Iranian religions and myths.[84]\n\n\nAs with other *Star Wars* films, themes about family and hope are featured prominently. In the *Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian* episode \"Legacy\", Dave Filoni explains that the use of \"Duel of the Fates\" during the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi represents the fight for the fate of Anakin Skywalker. According to Filoni, Qui-Gon Jinn acts like a father figure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking him from his mother, having realized that the Jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care. In the end, Qui-Gon dies, and thus Anakin loses his father figure; Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately becomes his master to honor Jinn's dying wish despite his initial contempt for him, and while he comes to eventually see him like a brother as shown in *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith*, he doesn't act like a father, which coupled with the Jedi's indifference, seals Anakin's fate.[88]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)\n\nAs with previous *Star Wars* films, *Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace*'s score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams decided to use electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to \"capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra might not have been able to provide\", and create an atmosphere that was \"more mysterious and mystical and less military\" than those of the original trilogy.[89] One of the most notable tracks is \"Duel of the Fates\", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video.[90] While composing Anakin's theme, Williams tried to reflect the innocence of his childhood and to foreshadow his transformation into Darth Vader by using slight suggestions of \"The Imperial March\" in the melody.[89]\n\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on May 4, 1999. This album featured the score, which Williams restructured as a listening experience; it is not presented in film order and omits many notable cues from the film because of the space restriction of the compact disc.[91] A two-disc \"Ultimate Edition\" was released on November 14, 2000. The set features the entire score as it is heard in the film, including all of the edits and loops that were made for the sound mix.[92]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm spent US$20 million on the film's advertising campaign and made promotional licensing deals with Hasbro, Lego, Tricon Global Restaurants and PepsiCo.[93] Lucasfilm also helped the *Star Wars* fan club to organize an event called *Star Wars* Celebration, which was held in Denver, Colorado, between April 30 and May 2, 1999.[94]\n\n\nThe first teaser trailer was released on selected screens accompanying *Meet Joe Black* on November 17, 1998,[95] and media reported that people were paying full admission at theaters to see the trailer. Other films that played this trailer included *The Waterboy*, *The Siege* and *A Bug's Life*.[96] To keep fans from leaving before the movie was over, some theaters played the teaser an additional time after the film finished.[97] The second trailer debuted on March 12, 1999, with the film *Wing Commander*. Again, many fans paid full theater admission to watch the new trailer.[98] A bootlegged version of the preview was leaked to the Internet the same day.[99] The next morning, the trailer was released on the film's official website and shortly afterwards the servers became overloaded.[100] This trailer had over 1 million downloads within its first 24 hours of release, setting a record for the most downloaded trailer until it was surpassed by *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* in April 2000.[101][102] The theatrical trailer caused even more media attention because it was premiered in theaters and screened at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas,[103] and was aired on *Entertainment Tonight* and *Access Hollywood*.[99]\n\n\nThe teaser poster, featuring Anakin with his shadow forming Darth Vader's silhouette, was released on November 10, 1998. After Lucas opted for a drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, it could not be modified in any way.[104] The film also reused the *Godzilla* slogan on teaser posters.[105]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nA novelization was written by Terry Brooks, who met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance. It includes some scenes that are not in the film and foreshadows pending developments in the following two installments of the series.[106] Additionally, a Scholastic junior novelization was written by Patricia C. Wrede.[107] A four-issue comic book adaptation was written by Henry Gilroy and published by Dark Horse Comics.[108] The film was again adapted as part of the all-ages *Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy – A Graphic Novel*, released by Disney-Lucasfilm Press in 2017.[109]\n\n\nA LucasArts video game adaptation was released for the PlayStation and PC.[110] The podracing tie-in *Star Wars Episode I: Racer* was released for Nintendo 64, PC and other platforms. A pinball machine was created by WMS Industries.[111]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe release of the first new *Star Wars* film in 16 years was accompanied by a considerable amount of attention.[112] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, so many workers announced plans to view the premiere that many companies closed on the opening day.[113] Queue areas formed outside cinema theaters over a month before ticket sales began.[114] More theater lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was because of a fear that family theater-goers would be either unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices for them. Instead, tickets were to be sold on a first-come-first-served basis.[115] However, after meetings with the National Association of Theatre Owners, Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on May 12, 1999, provided there was a limit of 12 tickets per customer.[116] As a result, some advance tickets were sold by scalpers at prices as high as US$100 apiece, which a distribution chief called \"horrible\" and said was exactly what they wanted to avoid.[117] *Daily Variety* reported that theater owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8–12 weeks, no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obliged to send their payments to distributor 20th Century Fox within seven days.[118]\n\n\nDespite worries about the film being finished on time, two weeks before its theatrical release, Lucasfilm moved the release date from May 21 to 19, 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas said the change was intended to give the fans a \"head start\" by allowing them to view it during the week and allowing families to view it during weekends. Eleven charity premieres were staged across the United States on May 16, 1999; receipts from the Los Angeles event, where corporate packages were available for between US$5,000 and US$25,000; proceeds were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.[119] Other charity premieres included the Dallas premiere for the Children's Medical Center, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the Big Brother/Sister Association of the Philadelphia premiere, and the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. A statement said that tickets were sold at US$500 apiece and that certain sections of the theaters were set aside for disadvantaged children.[120]\n\n\nThe film had its UK premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event held in aid of the Film & TV Charity, on the 14th July, 1999 at the ODEON Leicester Square. This event was attended by Charles III and helped to raise £225,000 for the charity.[121]\n\n\nThe film opened at 12:01 am on Wednesday, May 19, 1999, in 2,010 theaters in the United States and Canada. An additional 960 theaters screened the film later in the day. About 120 theaters showed the film continuously on opening day, including the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City and the Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[122] Foreshadowing his future conversion to digital cinematography, Lucas said the film would be released on four digital projectors (two in New York and two in Los Angeles) on June 18, 1999.[123] Few film studios released films during the same week: DreamWorks and Universal Studios released *The Love Letter* on May 21 and *Notting Hill* on May 28, respectively.[124] *The Love Letter* was a commercial failure but *Notting Hill* fared better and followed *The Phantom Menace* closely in second place.[125] Employment consultant firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees missed work to attend the film, resulting in a US$293 million loss of productivity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison between the puppet of Yoda, present in the original 1999 theatrical and 2001 DVD releases, and the computer-generated model, present in the 2011 Blu-ray Disc and 3D releases\nThe film was released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There were two versions of the film, which were a standard pan and scan version and a widescreen Collector's Edition version. In its first two days of availability, the regular version sold 4.5 million copies and the limited edition sold 500,000.[126] A year later on June 19, 2001, it was announced that *The Phantom Menace* would become the first *Star Wars* film to be officially released on DVD, in a slightly extended cut from the theatrical releases.[127] This THX certified two-disc DVD release debuted on October 16 of the same year.[128] The first disc contains the film and the second disc contains special features. On the first disc, there are three randomized selected menus themed to the planets Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant.[129] There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[130] The special features include seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, a commentary track featuring Lucas and producer Rick McCallum, and several documentaries—including a full-length documentary entitled *The Beginning: Making Episode I*.[129][131] There are also DVD-ROM features, including trailers for *Attack of the Clones*.[132] *The Phantom Menace* became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States; 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[133][134] This surpassed the previous record held by *The Mummy Returns*, which sold 2 million copies within its first week.[135] Less than a month later, *The Phantom Menace*'s record for being the fastest-selling DVD was taken by *Shrek* when it sold 2.5 million copies in its first three days.[136] *The Phantom Menace* was one of the only four films to sell over 2 million DVD copies during their first weeks of release at the time, with the others being *The Mummy Returns*, *Shrek* and *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[137] The film would overall earn $45 million from its first week DVD sales, more than the theatrical releases of *From Hell*, *Riding in Cars with Boys*, *Training Day* and other post-9/11 films.[133]\n\n\nAt the 5th Annual DVD awards, *The Phantom Menace* won four categories: Viewers' Choice Award, Best Menu Design, Best Authoring and Best Audio Presentation, with the latter award being tied with *Pearl Harbor*.[138]\n\n\nThe DVD version was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[139] A LaserDisc version of *The Phantom Menace* was released in Japan on April 7, 2000, a year and a half before it was available on DVD in the U.S.[140] The *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011;[141] *The Phantom Menace* was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8% of the picture to the frame.[142] In the Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.[143]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *The Phantom Menace* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[144]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued *The Phantom Menace* on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on September 22, 2019.[145] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[146] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.[147]\n\n\n\n### 3D re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series would be stereo-converted to 3D. These would be re-released in episode order, beginning with *The Phantom Menace*, which was released to cinemas on February 10, 2012.[148] Prime Focus Limited did the conversion under the supervision of ILM.[149] However, the 3D re-releases of Episodes *II–VI* were postponed or canceled after Lucasfilm was bought by The Walt Disney Company, who decided to focus on the development of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[150]\n\n\nLucas stated the 3D re-release was \"just a conversion\" of the film's 2011 Blu-ray release and no additional changes were made.[151] Only a change to Anakin's magnetic wand during the podrace scene—its tip was sharpened to more accurately fit the original 2D photography to the new 3D image—was confirmed.[152]\n\n\nGeneral Mills and Brisk were promotional partners in North America for the 3D re-release but promotion was limited.[153][154] The film was extensively promoted in Japan; promotional products were sold by 7-Eleven, Domino's Pizza, Pepsi and Gari-Gari Kun.[155] Kellogg's promoted the film internationally,[156][157] and French restaurant Quick launched three *Star Wars*-themed burgers. Lucasfilm also partnered with Variety, the Children's Charity to raise funds for children through the sale of a special edition badge.[158]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFollowing an advance screening on Saturday, May 8, 1999, several newspapers broke an agreement with Fox and published reviews of the film on Sunday, May 9. In a front-page review, the *Los Angeles Daily News* gave it 3½ stars calling it \"pretty good\" overall and \"outstanding in many parts\". The *New York Daily News* was less positive, giving it 2½ stars. *Variety* also made its review by Todd McCarthy available on the Sunday[159] with McCarthy calling it \"the most widely anticipated and heavily hyped film of modern times\" but said that the film \"can scarcely help being a letdown on some levels, but it's too bad that it disappoints on so many\" and that \"it is neither captivating nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull, as well as the sense of wonder and awe that marks the best works of sci-fi/fantasy\".[160]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 237 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Burdened by exposition and populated with stock characters, *The Phantom Menace* gets the *Star Wars* prequels off to a bumpy—albeit visually dazzling—start.\"[161] As of July 2022, the film is the lowest-rated live-action film of the *Star Wars* series dropping below *The Rise of Skywalker*.[162] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[163] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[164]\n\n\nMany aspects of the script and characters were criticized, especially that of Jar Jar Binks, who was regarded by many members of the older fan community as toyetic—a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character.[165][166] Ahmed Best had later said that he contemplated suicide after receiving backlash for his portrayal.[167] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* described Binks as \"a major miscue, a comic-relief character who's frankly not funny\".[168] Drew Grant of *Salon* wrote, \"Perhaps the absolute creative freedom director George Lucas enjoyed while dreaming up the flick's 'comic' relief—with no studio execs and not many an independently minded actor involved—is a path to the dark side.\"[169]\n\n\nConversely, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking\" and said, \"Lucas tells a good story.\" Ebert also wrote that, \"If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable\" because it is the opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than *Star Trek* films, filmmakers could \"[g]ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day\".[170] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film a \"B\" grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes.[171] In an *Entertainment Weekly* review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a \"C−\", calling it \"haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile\".[172] ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote, \"Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, *The Phantom Menace* is still among the best 'bang for a buck' fun that can be had in a movie theater,\" and said the film was a \"distinct improvement\" over *Return of the Jedi*.[173]\n\n\nAndrew Johnston of *Time Out New York* wrote, \"Let's face it: no film could ever match the expectations some have for *Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided you accept it on its own terms ... Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, not the other way around.\"[174] Susan Wloszczyna of *USA Today* said that the film does \"plenty right\" and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto.[175] David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said that the film's better moments \"don't merely balance out the weaker ones—they topple them\".[176] Colin Kennedy of *Empire* magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, \"there is still much pleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in action\". He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance and said that the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi is \"the saga's very best lightsaber battle\".[177]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *The Phantom Menace* on its list of \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\",[178] while *Entertainment Weekly* and Comcast included the film on their lists of the worst movie sequels.[179][180] James Berardinelli wrote, \"*The Phantom Menace* was probably the most overhyped motion picture of the last decade (if not longer), and its reputation suffered as a result of its inability to satisfy unreasonable expectations.\"[181] William Arnold of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* agreed that the film's massive hype caused many of the negative reactions, saying, \"it built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled [the] element of storytelling surprise\". He also said that the film was \"well made and entertaining\" and was much better than similar box office fare released around that year, such as *The Mummy* and *The Matrix*.[182] Ewan McGregor said in 2002 that he was \"slightly disappointed\" that the film was \"kind of flat\" and believed the next film in the franchise would have \"much more humor and...color.\"[183]\n\n\nThe introduction of midi-chlorians—microscopic organisms that mediate use of the Force—has been regarded as controversial.[184] Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality. Film historian Daniel Dinello says, \"Anathema to *Star Wars* fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy.\"[185] Religion expert John D. Caputo writes, \"In the 'Gospel according to Lucas', a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled ... The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious: their bodily cells have a heavier than usual concentration of 'midi-chlorians'.\"[186]\n\n\nThere has been some controversy over whether several alien characters reflect racial stereotypes. For example, the oafish, slow-witted Jar Jar Binks has long droopy ears reminiscent of dreadlocks and spoke with what many perceived as a Caribbean patois reminiscent of Jamaican Creole.[187] Drew Grant describes the character as \"[s]ervile and cowardly ... a black minstrel-ish stereotype on par with Stepin Fetchit.\"[169] Georgetown University professor of African-American studies Michael Eric Dyson says that the entire Gungan species seems suggestive of a primitive African tribe, with Boss Nass portrayed as \"a fat, bumbling ... caricature of a stereotypical African tribal chieftain.\"[165] The greedy and corrupt Neimoidians of the Trade Federation have been noted as resembling East Asian stereotypes,[188] and the unprincipled trader Watto has been interpreted as a Jewish stereotype reminiscent of Charles Dickens' character Fagin.[189] Lucas has denied all of these implications,[165] instead criticizing the American media for using opinions from the Internet as a reliable source for news stories. Lucas added that it reflects more the racism of the commenters than it does the movie;[190] however, animator Rob Coleman said ahead of the film's release that Watto's mannerisms were inspired by footage of Alec Guinness as Fagin in *Oliver Twist*.[191]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nEven though it received mixed reviews, *The Phantom Menace* was a financial success, breaking many box office records in its debut, and beating out *The Mummy* by taking number 1. The film broke *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*'s records for the largest single-day gross for taking more than $28 million in the opening day and fastest to gross $100 million in five days. Additionally, it grossed $64.8 million in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*.[192] It also became the quickest film to reach the $200 million and $300 million marks, surpassing *Independence Day* (1996) and *Titanic* (1997), respectively.[193][194] *The Phantom Menace* held both records before *Spider-Man* took them in 2002.[195][196] It would go on to earn $105.7 million, making it the highest five-day Wednesday opening weekend of all time.[192] The film had the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film for two years until 2001 when it was taken by *Planet of the Apes*.[197] Its opening day record was handed to *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* that same year.[198] Two years later in 2003, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* surpassed *The Phantom Menace* for having the largest five-day Wednesday opening weekend.[199] During its second weekend, *The Phantom Menace* made $51.3 million, making it the highest-grossing second weekend at the time, surpassing *Jurassic Park*. The film would hold this record until it was surpassed a year later by *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[200] In total, the film stayed at the top of the box office for three weeks until it was overtaken by *Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me* during its fourth weekend.[201] *The Phantom Menace* was 1999's most successful film, staying in the Top 10 until August 5 (11 weeks total), earning $431.1 million in the United States and Canada.[202] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 84.8 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[203]\n\n\nThe film set an opening record in Japan, grossing $12.2 million in its first two days from 403 screens.[204] In the UK, the film also set an opening record with £9.5 million in its opening weekend (including previews), surpassing *Men in Black*.[205][206] It would go on to hold this record until it was taken by *Toy Story 2* a few months later.[207] *The Phantom Menace* also grossed a record $11 million in its opening weekend in Germany.[208] Outside the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $10 million in Australia ($25.9 million), Brazil ($10.4 million), France and Algeria ($43 million), Germany ($53.9 million), Italy ($12.9 million), Japan ($109.9 million), Mexico ($12 million), Spain ($25 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($81.9 million).[209] Its overseas total was $493.2 million, taking its worldwide total to $924.3 million.[202] At that time, the film was the third-highest-grossing film in North America behind *Titanic* and *Star Wars* (1977), and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide behind *Titanic* without adjusting for inflation of ticket prices. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, it ranked as the 19th-highest-grossing film domestically, making it the fourth *Star Wars* film to be in the Inflation-Adjusted Top 20.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter its 3D re-release in 2012, the worldwide box office gross exceeded $1 billion.[210] Although in the intervening years, the film had lost some of its rankings in the lists of highest-grossing films, the 3D re-release returned it to the worldwide all-time Top 10 for several months.[211] In North America, its revenues overtook those of the original *Star Wars* as the saga's highest-grossing film when not adjusting for inflation of ticket prices, and is the tenth-highest-grossing film in North America as of August 2017[update].[212] In North America, its ranking on the Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation list climbed to 16th place—one place behind *Return of the Jedi*.[213] The 3D re-release, which premiered in February 2012, earned $43 million—$22.5 million of which was in North America—worldwide.[214] The 3D re-release earned US$102,727,119 worldwide—including $43.5 million in North America—and has increased the film's overall box office takings to $474.5 million domestically, and $552.5 million in other territories.[215] The film's earnings exceeded $1 billion worldwide on February 22, 2012, making it the first *Star Wars* film and the 11th film in history—excluding inflation—to do so.[210][215]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Shawn Murphy and John Midgley); all of which went to *The Matrix*.[216][217] The film won Saturn Awards for Best Costumes and Best Special Effects,[218] the MTV Movie Award for Best Action Scene,[219] and a Young Artist Award for Jake Lloyd's performance.[220] It was also nominated for—among others—the BAFTAs for Visual Effects and Sound,[221] and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.[222] The film did however receive seven Golden Raspberry Award (Razzie) nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor (Jake Lloyd as Anakin), Worst Supporting Actress (Sofia Coppola as Saché), Worst Screen Couple (Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman), and Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best won the Worst Supporting Actor category.[223]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\nA sequel, *Attack of the Clones*, was released in 2002.[224] The story continues a decade later with Anakin grown to adulthood, played by Hayden Christensen.[225][226] A second sequel, *Revenge of the Sith*, was released in 2005 and culminates with Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader.[227]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released the parody song and music video \"The Saga Begins\", in which he interprets the film's plot from Obi-Wan's point of view to the tune of \"American Pie\"; this was included as a bonus feature on a 2011 *Star Wars* Blu-ray.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2018 *Saturday Night Live* comedy rap video, Natalie Portman reprised her appearance as Queen Amidala from *The Phantom Menace* and defended the prequel trilogy.[228]\n\n\nThe film is known for starting the Lego Star Wars toyline and has become one of Lego's most successful licensed brands.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDarth Maul's lightsaber-fighting style served as the inspiration for the 2003 viral video *Star Wars Kid*. Maul, who appears to die in *The Phantom Menace*, was resurrected for the animated series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*, and he also appears on *Star Wars Rebels* and in *Solo: A Star Wars Story*. In 2012, IGN named Maul the 16th-greatest *Star Wars* character.[229] A similar weapon to his dual-bladed lightsaber appears in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*.[230]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The DVD released in 2001 extends the film by about three minutes, giving it a run time of 136 minutes.[*citation needed*]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Later titled *Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope*\n3. **^** The 2008 animated television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* establishes that Maul survived.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\".

The sequel to *The Phantom Menace* (1999), it is the fifth film in the *Star Wars* film series and second chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". The film stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker,\nFrank Oz, Temuera Morrison, Silas Carson, and Jimmy Smits.\n\n\nThe story is set ten years after *The Phantom Menace*, as thousands of planetary systems slowly secede from the Galactic Republic and join the newly formed Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by former Jedi Master Count Dooku. With the galaxy on the brink of civil war, Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates a mysterious assassination attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala, which leads him to uncover a clone army in service of the Republic and the truth behind the Separatist movement. Meanwhile, his apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect Amidala and develops a secret romance with her. Soon, the trio witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy: the Clone Wars.\n\n\nDevelopment of *Attack of the Clones* began in March 2000, some months after the release of *The Phantom Menace*. By June 2000, Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script, and principal photography took place from June to September 2000. The film crew primarily shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Australia, with additional footage filmed in Tunisia, Spain, and Italy. It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a high-definition digital 24-frame system.\n\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews from critics; the film's increased focus on action was praised, while the characters and dialogue were regarded more critically. It performed well at the box office, making $653.8 million worldwide. Yet, it became the first *Star Wars* film to get outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically after *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and fourth-highest-grossing worldwide after the former two films and *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*.[3] *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *Attack of the Clones*, concluding the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nTen years after the battle at Naboo,[a] the Galactic Republic is threatened by a Separatist movement organized by former Jedi Master Count Dooku. Senator Padmé Amidala travels to Coruscant to vote against a motion to create an army to assist the Jedi against the threat. Narrowly avoiding an assassination attempt upon arrival, she is placed under the protection of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker. The pair thwart a second assassination attempt on Padmé. They subdue the assassin, Zam Wesell, whose employer, a bounty hunter, kills her before she reveals his identity. The Jedi Council instructs Obi-Wan to find the bounty hunter, while Anakin is tasked to protect Padmé and escort her to Naboo. Despite the Jedi Code that forbids attachments, the two fall in love.\n\n\nObi-Wan's search leads to Kamino, an ocean planet. There he discovers a clone army is being produced for the Republic under the name of Sifo-Dyas, a deceased Jedi Master. The bounty hunter Jango Fett serves as their genetic template. Obi-Wan deduces Jango is the bounty hunter he is seeking, and after a brief battle, places a homing beacon on Jango's ship, *Slave I*. He then follows Jango and his clone son, Boba, to the planet Geonosis. Meanwhile, Anakin is troubled by visions of his mother, Shmi, in pain, and returns to his homeworld of Tatooine with Padmé to save her. Watto reveals he sold Shmi to moisture farmer Cliegg Lars, who then freed and married her. Cliegg says Tusken Raiders abducted Shmi one month earlier and she is likely dead. Anakin finds her at the Tusken campsite, barely alive. After she dies in his arms, an enraged Anakin massacres the entire tribe. He later confesses his actions to Padmé and vows to prevent the deaths of those he loves.\n\n\nOn Geonosis, Obi-Wan discovers a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku, who is developing a droid army with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who ordered the assassination attempts on Padmé. Obi-Wan transmits his findings to the Jedi Council but is captured by Separatist droids. Dooku meets Obi-Wan in his cell and explains that the Republic is under the control of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. He invites Obi-Wan to help him stop Sidious, but Obi-Wan refuses. Senate Representative Jar Jar Binks proposes a successful vote to grant emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine, allowing the clone army to be authorized.\n\n\nAnakin and Padmé head to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan. While in the Geonosian droid factory, Anakin loses his lightsaber before Jango captures them. In an arena, Dooku sentences the trio to death at the hands of the Reek, the Nexu, and the Acklay. A battalion of clone troopers led by Yoda, Mace Windu, and other Jedi suddenly arrive; Windu beheads Jango during the ensuing battle. Obi-Wan and Anakin intercept Dooku and engage in a lightsaber duel. Dooku injures Obi-Wan and severs Anakin's right arm; Yoda intervenes and defends them. To distract Yoda, Dooku uses the Force in an attempt to kill Anakin and Obi-Wan. Dooku escapes to Coruscant and delivers the schematics for a super-weapon to Sidious. The Jedi Council is disturbed by Dooku's statement that Sidious controls the Senate. As the Jedi acknowledge the beginning of the Clone Wars,[b] Anakin is fitted with a robotic arm and secretly marries Padmé on Naboo.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Ewan McGregor](image)\n![A photograph of Natalie Portman](image)\n![A photograph of Hayden Christensen](image)\nLeft to right: Ewan McGregor (pictured in 2012), Natalie Portman (2015), and Hayden Christensen (2010)\n\n* Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi: A Jedi Knight and mentor to his Padawan learner, Anakin Skywalker, who investigates the assassination attempt of Padmé, leading him to discover the production of a Clone Army for the Galactic Republic. In the 10 years since *The Phantom Menace*, he has grown wiser and more powerful in the use of the Force.\n* Natalie Portman as Padmé Amidala: Former Queen of Naboo, who has recently been elected the planet's Senator, and Anakin's love interest.\n* Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker: A 19-year-old former slave from Tatooine and Obi-Wan's gifted Padawan apprentice who is assigned to protect Padmé with whom he falls in love. He is believed to be the \"chosen one\" of Jedi prophecy destined \"to bring balance to The Force.\" In the 10 years since *The Phantom Menace*, he has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is holding him back. A large search for an actor to portray Anakin Skywalker was performed. Lucas auditioned various actors, mostly unknown, before casting Christensen. Among the many established actors who auditioned or considered were Jonathan Brandis, Chris Klein, Devon Sawa,[4] Topher Grace,[5] Eric Christian Olsen, Joshua Jackson,[6] Erik von Detten, James Der Beek, Ryan Phillippe,[7] Colin Hanks,[8] and Paul Walker.[9][10] Leonardo DiCaprio also met with Lucas for the role, but was \"definitely unavailable\" according to DiCaprio publicist Ken Sunshine.[11] Co-star Natalie Portman later told *Time* magazine that Christensen \"gave a great reading. He could simultaneously be scary and really young.\"[12]\n* Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine / Darth Sidious: A former senator from Naboo, as well as a secret Sith Lord, who amasses vast emergency powers as the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic upon the outbreak of the Clone Wars.\n* Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu: A Jedi Master sitting on the Jedi Council who warily watches the Galactic Senate's politics.\n* Christopher Lee as Count Dooku / Darth Tyranus: A former Jedi Master and the old mentor of Obi-Wan's late master Qui-Gon Jinn, who is now the puppet leader of the Separatist movement as well as Darth Sidious' new Sith apprentice and a suspect in Obi-Wan's investigation.\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A protocol droid built by Anakin as a child who now serves the Lars family on Tatooine.\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2: Anakin's astromech droid who often accompanies him and Obi-Wan on missions.\n* Frank Oz as Yoda: The centuries-old Jedi Grandmaster of an unknown alien species. In addition to leading the Jedi Council, Yoda is the instructor for the young Jedi Padawans/\"Younglings\".\n\n\nPernilla August, Ahmed Best, Oliver Ford Davies, and Andy Secombe reprise their roles from *The Phantom Menace* as Shmi Skywalker, Jar Jar Binks, Sio Bibble, and Watto, respectively. Silas Carson also reprises his role from that film as both Nute Gunray, the Viceroy of the Trade Federation; and Ki-Adi-Mundi, a Cerean Jedi Master sitting on the Jedi Council. Jimmy Smits portrays Bail Organa, a senator from Alderaan. Temuera Morrison portrays Jango Fett, a bounty hunter who gave his DNA for use by the cloning facilities on Kamino for the creation of the clone army. Daniel Logan portrays a young Boba Fett, Jango Fett's clone and adopted son.\n\n\nJack Thompson, Joel Edgerton and Bonnie Piesse appear as members of the Lars family and homestead; respectively as Cliegg Lars, Shmi's husband, Owen's father and Anakin's stepfather; Owen Lars, Cliegg's son, Shmi's stepson, and Anakin's stepbrother; and Beru Whitesun, Owen's girlfriend. Leeanna Walsman appears as Zam Wesell, a shapeshifting Clawdite bounty hunter and partner of Jango Fett, who was given the task of assassinating Padmé. Jay Laga'aia appears as Gregar Typho, Padmé's newly appointed captain of security. Rose Byrne and Alethea McGrath briefly appear as Dormé, Padmé's handmaiden and as Jocasta Nu, the librarian at the Jedi Temple, respectively. Ronald Falk provides the voice of Dexter Jettster, Obi-Wan's Besalisk friend who runs a diner on Coruscant and informs him about Kamino.\n\n\nDaniels and Best also make cameo appearances as Dannl Faytonni and Achk Med-Beq, respectively, attendees of the Coruscant Outlander Club who witness Anakin and Obi-Wan capturing Zam Wesell.[13][14] E! reported that Lucas had asked NSYNC to film a small background cameo appearance, in order to satisfy his daughters. They were subsequently cut out of the film in post-production, although briefly visible during a crowd shot from above.[15] The end credits erroneously list Alan Ruscoe as playing Neimoidian senator Lott Dod. The character was actually another Neimoidian, played by an uncredited David Healy and voiced by Christopher Truswell. Archival recordings of Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn from *The Phantom Menace*, appear as a disembodied ghostly voice heard by Anakin through the Force as he was slaughtering the Tusken Raiders; Qui-Gon also appears earlier in the film in the form of a statue in his likeness during a background scene when Obi-Wan visits the Jedi Archives. Fiona Johnson reprised her *The Matrix* (1999) role as the Woman in the Red Dress in an Easter egg cameo appearance, with her character named \"Hayde Gofai\" in later *Star Wars* media, briefly offering a seductive look to Anakin Skywalker at the Outlander Club.[16]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nAfter the mixed critical response to *The Phantom Menace*, Lucas was hesitant to return to the writing desk. In March 2000, just three months before the start of principal photography, Lucas finally completed his rough draft for *Episode II*. Lucas continued to iterate on his rough draft, producing a proper first and second draft. For help with the third draft, which would later become the shooting script, Lucas brought on Jonathan Hales, who had written several episodes of *The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles* for him, but had limited experience writing theatrical films. The final script was completed just three days before the start of principal photography.[17]\n\n\nAs an in-joke, the film's working title was *Jar Jar's Great Adventure*, a sarcastic reference to the negative fan response to the *Episode I* character.[18]\n\n\nIn writing *The Empire Strikes Back*, Lucas initially decided that Lando Calrissian was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the \"Clone Wars\" mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi in *A New Hope*;[19][20] he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which were used by the Republic as an army in the war that followed.[21]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars filming locations\n\n![](image)Plaza de España was the filming location for the Naboo palace.\nPrincipal photography occurred between June 26, 2000, and September 20, 2000, at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney. Location shooting took place in the Tunisian desert, at the Plaza de España in Seville, London, China, Vancouver, San Diego, and Italy (Villa del Balbianello on Lake Como, and in the former royal Palace of Caserta).[*citation needed*] At his own personal request, Samuel L. Jackson's character Mace Windu received a lightsaber that emits a purple glow, as opposed to traditional blue or green for \"good guys\" and red for \"bad guys\".[22] Reshoots were performed in March 2001. During this time, a new action sequence was developed featuring the droid factory after Lucas had decided that the film lacked a quick enough pace in the corresponding time-frame. The sequence's previsualization was rushed, and the live-action footage was shot within four and a half hours.[23] Because of Lucas' method of creating shots through various departments and sources that are sometimes miles and years apart from each other, *Attack of the Clones* became the first film ever to be produced through what Rick McCallum called \"virtual filmmaking\".[23] Back at Fox Studios, the stages from McGregor's other film *Moulin Rouge!* were reused during filming.[24]\n\n\nLike *The Phantom Menace*, *Attack of the Clones* furthered technological development, effectively moving Hollywood into the \"digital age\" with the use of the HDW-F900, developed by Sony and Panavision, a digital camera using an HD digital 24-frame system. This spawned controversy over the benefits and disadvantages of digital cinematography that continues as more filmmakers \"convert\" to digital filmmaking while many filmmakers oppose it. In contrast to previous installments, for which scenes were shot in the Tunisian desert in temperatures up to 125 °F (51 °C), the camera would still run without complications. Lucas had stated that he wished to film *The Phantom Menace* on this format but Sony was unable to build the cameras quickly enough.[25] Sony's cameras arrived one week before principal photography on *Attack of the Clones* was about to start.[26] In 2002, *Attack of the Clones* became the third film to be released that was shot entirely on a 24p digital camera (preceded by 2001's *Jackpot* and *Vidocq*).[27] The cameras record in the 16:9 HDCAM format (1080p), although the image was cropped to a 2.40:1 widescreen ratio. The area above and below the 2.40 extraction area was available for Lucas to reframe the picture as necessary in post-production.\nDespite Lucas' efforts to persuade movie theaters to switch to digital projectors for viewing of *Episode II*, few theaters did.[28]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nThe film relied almost solely on digital animatics as opposed to storyboards in order to previsualize sequences for editing early on in the film's production. While Lucas had used other ways of producing motion-based storyboards in the past, after *The Phantom Menace* the decision was made to take advantage of the growing digital technology.[23] The process began with Ben Burtt's creation of what the department dubbed as \"videomatics\", so called because they were shot on a household videocamera. In these videomatics, production assistants and relatives of the department workers acted out scenes in front of greenscreen. Using computer-generated imagery (CGI), the previsualization department later filled in the green screen with rough background footage. Burtt then cut together this footage and sent it off to Lucas for changes and approval. The result was a rough example of what the final product was intended to be. The previsualization department then created a finer version of the videomatic by creating an animatic, in which the videomatic actors, props, and sets were replaced by digital counterparts to give a more precise, but still rough, look at what would eventually be seen. The animatic was later brought on set and shown to the actors so that they could understand the concept of the scene they were filming in the midst of the large amount of bluescreen used. Unlike most of the action sequences, the Battle of Geonosis was not story-boarded or created through videomatics but was sent straight to animatics after the department received a small vague page on the sequence. The intent was to create a number of small events that would be edited together for pacing inside the finished film. The animatics department was given a free hand regarding events to be created within the animatic; Lucas only asked for good action shots that he could choose from and approve later.[23]\n\n\nIn addition to introducing the digital camera, *Attack of the Clones* emphasized \"digital doubles\" as computer-generated models that doubled for actors, in the same way that traditional stunt doubles did. It also furthered the authenticity of computer-generated characters by introducing a new, completely CGI-created version of the character Yoda. Rob Coleman and John Knoll prepared two tests featuring a CGI-animated Yoda using audio from *The Empire Strikes Back*. Yoda's appearance in *Episode V* also served as the reference point for the creation of the CGI Yoda; Lucas repeatedly stated to the animation department that \"the trick\" to the animation of the CGI Yoda was to make him like the puppet from which he was based, in order to maintain a flow of continuity. Frank Oz (voice and puppeteer for Yoda in the original trilogy and *The Phantom Menace*) was consulted; his main piece of advice was that Yoda should look extremely old, sore, and frigid.[29] Coleman later explained the process of making the digital Yoda like the puppet version, by saying \"When Frank [Oz] would move the head, the ears would jiggle. If we hadn't put that in, it wouldn't look like Yoda.\"[30] Because of the acrobatics of the lightsaber fight between Count Dooku and Yoda, the then 78-year-old Christopher Lee relied on a stunt double to perform the most demanding scenes instead. Lee's face was superimposed onto the double's body in all shots other than close-ups, which he performed himself. Lucas often called the duel crucial to the animation department, as it had such potential to be humorous rather than dramatic.[29]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on April 23, 2002, by Sony Classical Records.[31] The music was composed and conducted by John Williams, and performed by the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra.[32] The soundtrack recreates \"The Imperial March\" from the film *The Empire Strikes Back* for its first chronological appearance in *Attack of the Clones*, even though a hint of it appeared in the previous movie in one of the final scenes. A music video for the main theme \"Across the Stars\" was produced specifically for the DVD.[33]\n\n\nOn March 15, 2016, a limited edition vinyl version of the soundtrack was released. Only 1,000 copies were pressed initially.[34]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\n![Numerous rows of soldiers walking out of a large spaceship](image)Clone troopers march onto their starships.\nLucas has noted that Palpatine's rise to power is very similar to that of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany; as Chancellor of Germany, the latter was granted emergency powers, as is Palpatine.[35] Comparisons have been made to Octavian—who became Augustus, the first emperor of Rome—and to Napoleon Bonaparte, who rose to power in France from 1796 to 1799. Octavian was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of political opponents well before he was granted tribunician powers; Bonaparte was appointed First Consul for life (and later Emperor) by the French Consulate after a failed attempt on his life and the subsequent *coup* of 18 Brumaire in 1799.[36] References to the American Civil War can also be discerned.[36] War journalism, combat films, and footage of World War II combat influenced the documentary-style camera work of the Battle of Geonosis, even to the point that hand-held shakes were digitally added to computer-generated sequences.[36]\n\n\nEnglish scholar Anne Lancashire describes *Attack of the Clones* as \"thoroughly political in its narrative\", to the point that interpersonal relations are made subordinate to the political drama that unfolds, and \"a critique of the increasing role played by economic and political appetite in contemporary First World international politics in general\". In this political drama, the Trade Federation, the former idealist Dooku, and Palpatine \"[represent] the economic and political greed and ambition ... of the political and business classes\", while the intuition of the Jedi has been clouded by the dark side of the Force. The cityscape of Coruscant, the location of the Jedi Temple, is a dystopian environment that refers to 1982's *Blade Runner*.[36] Nevertheless, the Jedi endure as the heroes; Obi-Wan's role has been noted as similar to that of James Bond,[37] and Zam Wesell's attempt on Padmé's life is similar to a scene in the first 007 film, *Dr. No*.[38] Furthermore, the Geonosis arena fight scene is a reference to the 2000 Ridley Scott film, *Gladiator*.[39]\n\n\nThe prequel trilogy films often refer to the original trilogy in order to help connect the films together. Lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes.[40] Such examples include the line \"I have a bad feeling about this\", a phrase used in each film, and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit. As with *Attack of the Clones*, *The Empire Strikes Back* was the middle film in a trilogy, and of the original trilogy films, *The Empire Strikes Back* is the object of the most references in *Attack of the Clones*. In both films, an asteroid field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film. Obi-Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; Han Solo uses a similar tactic by attaching the *Millennium Falcon* to a Star Destroyer in *The Empire Strikes Back*. As a retcon, John Knoll confirms on the film's DVD commentary that Boba Fett, who would later catch Solo in the act in *The Empire Strikes Back*, \"learned his lesson\" from the events of *Attack of the Clones*.[35] The Galactic Republic's clone troopers also establish the origin of the stormtroopers that play an important role in the original trilogy.[*citation needed*] The titles of both films refer to the response of the primary galactic government to a threat of rebellion.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2001, three teaser trailers for *Attack of the Clones* were released, which were shown on the Internet, as well as the DVD-ROM selection of *The Phantom Menace* DVD release. The first one was released on November 2 with the Disney Pixar film *Monsters, Inc.* in theaters.[41] A second teaser debuted online three days later on November 5. This was followed by a third teaser trailer, which was released on November 16 with the global release of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the United States. Just like its predecessor, fans paid full admission at theaters to see the trailers.[42] The next trailer premiered on Fox Network on March 10, 2002, between *Malcolm in the Middle* and *The X-Files*, followed by a theatrical debut five days later on March 15 with the opening of *Ice Age*.[43] It was made available on the official *Star Wars* website the same day.[44] The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas from Chicago predicted before the film's release that U.S. companies could lose more than $319 million in productivity due to employees calling in sick and then heading to theaters to see the film.[45]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe film premiered as part of the inaugural Tribeca Film Festival at the BMCC Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers St. in New York City[46] at a Sunday, May 12 set of screenings benefitting the Children's Aid Society, a charity supported by George Lucas.[47] *Attack of the Clones* was then screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival,[48] before getting a worldwide theatrical release on May 16, 2002. The film was also later released in IMAX theaters; the film had not been filmed for IMAX but was \"up converted\" with the digital remastering process. Because of the technical limitations of the IMAX projector at the time, an edited, 120-minute version of the film was presented.[49]\n\n\nBefore the film's release, there was a string of controversies regarding copyright infringement. In 2000, an underground organization calling itself the Atlas Group, based in Perth, Western Australia offered a copy of the screenplay, with an asking price of US$100,000, to various fan sites and media organizations, including TheForce.Net. The scheme was subsequently reported to Lucasfilm Ltd. by the fan site.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAn unauthorized copy was allegedly made at a private showing, using a digital recorder that was pointed at the screen. This copy spread over the internet, and analysts predicted up to a million fans would have seen the film before the day of its release.[50] In addition, authorities seized thousands of bootlegs throughout Kuala Lumpur before the film opened.[51]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Attack of the Clones* was released on DVD and VHS on November 12, 2002.[52] On the first day of release, over 4 million DVD copies were sold, becoming the third-highest single-day DVD sales of any film, behind *Monsters, Inc.* and *Spider-Man*.[53] This THX certified two-disc DVD release consists of widescreen and pan and scan fullscreen versions. The set contains one disc with the film and the other one with bonus features. The first disc features three randomized selected menus, which are Coruscant, Kamino and Geonosis. There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[54] The DVD also features an audio commentary from director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor and sound designer Ben Burtt, ILM animation director Rob Coleman, and ILM visual effects supervisors Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow. Eight deleted scenes are included along with multiple documentaries, which include a full-length documentary about the creation of digital characters and two others that focus on sound design and the animatics team. Three featurettes examine the storyline, action scenes, and love story, and a set of 12 short web documentaries cover the overall production of the film.[55]\n\n\nThe *Attack of the Clones* DVD also features a trailer for a mockumentary-style short film known as *R2-D2: Beneath the Dome*. Some stores offered the full mockumentary as an exclusive bonus disc for a small extra charge. The film gives an alternate look at the \"life\" of the droid R2-D2. The story, which Lucas approved, was meant to be humorous.[56]\n\n\nThe film was re-released in a prequel trilogy DVD box set on November 4, 2008.[57]\n\n\nThe six-film *Star Wars* saga was released on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011, in three different editions.[58]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *Attack of the Clones* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play, and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[59]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued *Attack of the Clones* on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on September 22, 2019.[60] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[61] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 31, 2020, whilst being re-released on Blu-ray and DVD.[62]\n\n\n\n### 3D re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010 (2010-09-28), it was announced that all six films in the series were to be stereo-converted to 3D, and re-released in chronological order beginning at *The Phantom Menace* which was released on February 10, 2012 (2012-02-10). *Attack of the Clones* was originally scheduled to be re-released in 3D on September 20, 2013 (2013-09-20),[63] but was postponed due to Lucasfilm's desire to focus on *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[64][65][66] However, the 3D presentation of the film was first shown at Celebration Europe II from July 26 to 28, 2013.[67][68][69]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 257 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"*Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones* benefits from an increased emphasis on thrilling action, although they're once again undercut by ponderous plot points and underdeveloped characters.\"[70] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 39 critics, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\".[71] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the previous film.[72]\n\n\nNumerous critics characterized the dialogue as \"stiff\" and \"flat\".[73] The acting was also disparaged by some critics.[74] Conversely, other critics felt fans would be pleased to see that Jar Jar Binks has only a minor role.[75] Additionally, Jar Jar's attempts at comic relief seen in *The Phantom Menace* were toned down; instead, C-3PO reprised some of his bumbling traditions in that role. McGregor referred to the swordplay in the film as \"unsatisfactory\" when comparing it to the climactic duel in *Revenge of the Sith* as it neared release.[76] ReelViews.net's James Berardinelli gave a positive review, saying \"in a time when, more often than not, sequels disappoint, it's refreshing to uncover something this high-profile that fulfills the promise of its name and adds another title to a storied legacy.\"[77]\n\n\nRoger Ebert, who had praised the previous *Star Wars* films, gave *Episode II* only two out of four stars, noting \"[As] someone who admired the freshness and energy of the earlier films, I was amazed, at the end of *Episode II*, to realize that I had not heard one line of quotable, memorable dialogue.\" About Anakin and Padme's relationship, Ebert stated, \"There is not a romantic word they exchange that has not long since been reduced to cliché.\"[74] Leonard Maltin, who also liked all of the previous installments, awarded two stars out of four to this endeavor as well, as seen in his *Movie and Video Guide* from the 2002 edition onward. Maltin cited an \"overlong story\" as reason for his dissatisfaction and added \"Wooden characterizations and dialogue don't help.\"[78] While *TheWrap* considered *Attack of the Clones* a \"marginal improvement\" over *The Phantom Menace*,[79] *Screen Rant* ranked it as inferior to *Episode I* and as the worst *Star Wars* film overall, citing its romance story, characterization, and acting as weak points.[80] Some film critics and fans criticized the CGI model of Yoda and his lightsaber fight; while many loved it, others believed it went against his character.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nDuring its opening day, *Attack of the Clones* made $30.1 million, combined with $6 million from midnight screenings.[81][82] At that point, it had the highest Thursday gross of any film, taking the former record held by *Independence Day*.[83] It would go on to make $116.3 million within its first four days, making it the second-fastest film to approach the $100 million mark, behind *Spider-Man*.[84] Plus, it had grossed over $80 million over the weekend,[85] becoming the third-highest three-day opening weekend of all time, after *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* and *Spider-Man*.[86] *Attack of the Clones* had the highest opening weekend for a 20th Century Fox film until 2003 when it was taken by *X2*.[87] That year, *The Matrix Reloaded* beat *Attack of the Clones* for having the biggest Thursday opening of any film.[88] The film would stay at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was dethroned by *The Sum of All Fears*.[89]\n\n\n*Attack of the Clones* grossed $310,676,740 in North America and $338,721,588 overseas for a worldwide total of $649,398,328. Though a box office success, it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box office success of *The Phantom Menace* three years earlier.[2] It was not the top-grossing film of the year, either in North America (where it finished in third place) or worldwide (where it was fourth), the first time that a *Star Wars* film did not have this distinction. In North America, it was outgrossed by *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, both of which were more favorably received by critics. Worldwide, it was also outgrossed by *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*. Adjusted for inflation, *Attack of the Clones* is the lowest-performing live-action *Star Wars* film at the North American box office, though is still among the 100 highest-grossing films of all time when adjusted for inflation. The film sold an estimated 52,012,300 tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[90]\n\n\nInternationally, *Attack of the Clones* made $69.1 million during its opening weekend from 71 countries, breaking *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*'s record for having the largest international opening weekend. The combined total gross increased to $173.9 million, making it the highest worldwide opening weekend at that time.[91] It made a total opening weekend gross of $54 million in Europe, with $17 million from the UK, $11 million from Germany, $7.6 million from France and $4.5 million from Spain.[92] The film also recorded the highest opening weekend in Hungary, surpassing *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*.[93] With a total gross of $954,000, *Attack of the Clones* had the second-highest opening of any film in Singapore, behind *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*.[94] Meanwhile, in Japan, it earned a total of $13.8 million in its first two days of release, joining *The Phantom Menace*, *Mission: Impossible 2* and *A.I. Artificial Intelligence* to rank themselves in the list of the country's top five highest opening weekends of all time.[95] Outside the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $10 million in Australia ($18.9 million), France and Algeria ($30.6 million), Germany ($35 million), Italy ($12.9 million), Japan ($78.1 million), Spain ($16.1 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($58.7 million).[2]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFollowing suit with the series' previous installments, the Academy Awards nominated *Attack of the Clones*' Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow for Best Visual Effects at the 2003 Academy Awards.[96][97] Natalie Portman was also honored at the Teen Choice Awards,[98] and the film received an award for Best Fight at the MTV Movie Awards.[99] In contrast, the film also received seven nominations from the Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture, Worst Director (George Lucas), Worst Screenplay (George Lucas), Worst Supporting Actor (Hayden Christensen), Worst Supporting Actress (Natalie Portman), Worst Screen Couple (Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman) and Worst Remake or Sequel.[100] It took home two awards for Worst Screenplay (George Lucas) and Worst Supporting Actor (Hayden Christensen).[101]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipients\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | March 23, 2003 | Best Visual Effects | Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow | Nominated\n |\n| Visual Effects Society[102] | February 19, 2003 | Best Visual Effects in an Effects Driven Motion Picture\n | John Knoll, Ben Snow, Pablo Helman, Rob Coleman | Nominated\n |\n| Best Character Animation in a Live Action Motion Picture\n | Rob Coleman, Hal Hickel, Chris Armstrong, James Tooley\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Matte Painting in a Motion Picture\n | Paul Huston, Yusei Uesugi, Jonathan Harb\n | Won\n |\n| Best Models and Miniatures in a Motion Picture\n | Brian Gernand, Russell Paul, Geoff Campbell, Jean Bolte\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Visual Effects Photography in a Motion Picture\n | Patrick Sweeney, Marty Rosenberg, Carl Miller, Fred Meyers\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Effects Art Direction in a Motion Picture\n | Alex Jaeger, Doug Chiang, Erik Tiemens, Ryan Church\n | Nominated\n |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards | March 22, 2003 | Worst Picture | Richard McCallum | Nominated\n |\n| Worst Director | George Lucas | Nominated\n |\n| Worst Screenplay | George Lucas, Jonathan Hales | Won\n |\n| Worst Supporting Actor | Hayden Christensen | Won\n |\n| Worst Supporting Actress | Natalie Portman | Nominated\n |\n| Worst Screen Couple | Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman | Nominated\n |\n| Worst Remake or Sequel | Richard McCallum | Nominated\n |\n| Stinkers Bad Movie Awards[103] | 2003 | Worst Supporting Actor\n | Hayden Christensen | Won\n |\n| Worst Screenplay for a Film Grossing More Than $100M Worldwide Using Hollywood Math\n | George Lucas, Jonathan Hales | Nominated\n |\n| Most Annoying Non-Human Character\n | Jar Jar Binks | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### Legacy and influence[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2023 interview, cartoonist and animation producer ND Stevenson said that he was compelled by the shapeshifting character, Zam Wesell, causing him to think more about shapeshifting, and said the film was where his \"love of shapeshifters specifically started.[104] In other interviews, Stevenson expressed his affinity for Wesell,[105][106] even stating that Double Trouble in *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* is meant as an homage to Wesell.[107] Stevenson also said that at an early age, Wesell created a huge impression on him, noting he latched onto Zam because she was a shapeshifter, causing him to come up with a version of the story when Zam lived, \"became the main character\" in a \"whole parallel world\" that Stevenson constructed.[108]\n\n\nIn the archivist field, the film has been critically approached for its depiction of a librarian stereotype in the character Jocasta Nu, the Jedi archivist/librarian of the Jedi Temple library. Some have noted that the archives depicted in the film resembles a library, while Nu wears clothing which represents her \"devotion to knowledge and learning\" and provides reference assistance to Obi-Wan Kenobi.[109][110] For instance, scholar Eric Ketelaar argued that Nu is an example of an archivist that \"mediates, shares, or obstructs\" power of the archives, as dictated by the film's plot.[111][112] In contrast, former Society of American Archivists president Randall C. Jimerson stated that the film provides a \"more confident view of archives\" than other media, showing the powerful and confident role of an archivist despite \"archival sabotage\".[113] Otherwise, Richard Pearce-Moses, stated the Nu's notion, that information not within the archives doesn't exist, is a \"naïve\" and is believed by some in regard to information not on the internet.[114]\n\n\nOther scholars have critically approached the film with different perspectives. Anna Lancashire stated that the film has the impact of turning the other films into an \"epic commentary on American and international politics and economics\", and on political empires based on aggressiveness, \"human greed...hatred, and fear\".[115] Timothy P. Chartier argued how the film can be used in classrooms for topics such as linear algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis.[116] Scholar Bradley Schauer said that the film is a unified, classical text, and argued that it has different meanings for \"both general and specialized audiences\".[117]\n\n\n\n## Novelizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (novel)\n\nTwo novels based on the film were published, a tie-in junior novel by Scholastic,[118] and a novelization written by R. A. Salvatore, which includes some unique scenes.[119] A four-issue comic book adaptation was written by Henry Gilroy and published by Dark Horse Comics.[120]\n\n\n\n## Sequel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\n\nA sequel titled *Revenge of the Sith* was released May 19, 2005 and was written and directed by George Lucas. It concludes the Prequel Trilogy with the story of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader as well as the death of Padmé Amidala and the destruction of all of the Jedi except for Obi-Wan and Yoda.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in the 1999 film *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.\n2. **^** As depicted in the 2008 television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*.\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars – Episode II – Attack of the Clones\".

It stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz. The sequel to *The Phantom Menace* (1999) and *Attack of the Clones* (2002), it is the sixth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the final installment in the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy, and third chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\".\n\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* is set three years after the onset of the Clone Wars as established in *Attack of the Clones*. The Jedi are spread across the galaxy in a full-scale war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on a mission to defeat General Grievous, the head of the Separatist army and Count Dooku's former apprentice, to put an end to the war. Meanwhile, after having visions of his wife Padmé Amidala dying in childbirth, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker is tasked by the Council to spy on Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, secretly, a Sith Lord. Palpatine manipulates Anakin into turning to the dark side of the Force and becoming his apprentice, Darth Vader, with wide-ranging consequences for the galaxy.\n\n\nLucas began writing the script before production of *Attack of the Clones* ended, citing that he wanted the end of the trilogy to have similar aspects to a romantic tragedy, thus building into Darth Vader's state at the beginning of the next film. Production of *Revenge of the Sith* started in June 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* premiered on May 15, 2005, at the Cannes Film Festival, then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with most regarding it as the best film of the prequel trilogy, although some criticism was reserved for Lucas's screenplay and Christensen's performance. It broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn $868.4 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film in the *Star Wars* franchise at the time. It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2005. It also holds the record for the highest opening-day gross on a Thursday, making $50 million.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOrbiting above Coruscant, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker lead a mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg Separatist commander General Grievous. After infiltrating Grievous' flagship, Obi-Wan and Anakin battle the Sith Lord Count Dooku, whom Anakin decapitates. Grievous escapes the damaged ship before Obi-Wan and Anakin crash-land it on Coruscant. There, Anakin reunites with Padmé Amidala. Soon after, Anakin has visions of the now-pregnant Padmé dying in childbirth.\n\n\nPalpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his personal representative. The Council agrees, but distrusting Palpatine, refuse to make Anakin a Jedi Master. They instead instruct him to spy on Palpatine, diminishing Anakin's faith in the Jedi. Meanwhile, on Utapau, Grievous relocates the Separatist leaders to the volcanic planet Mustafar. Obi-Wan travels to Utapau where he confronts and kills Grievous, while Yoda travels to the Wookiee planet of Kashyyyk to defend it from a Separatist invasion.\n\n\nPalpatine tempts Anakin with the dark side of the Force, promising it can save Padmé. Anakin deduces that Palpatine is the Sith Lord behind the Clone Wars[a] and reports his treachery to Mace Windu, who confronts and subdues Palpatine. Desperate to save Padmé, Anakin prevents Windu from killing Palpatine, who then sends Windu falling to his death. Anakin pledges himself to the Sith, and Palpatine knights him as Darth Vader. Palpatine issues Order 66, which commands the clone troopers to kill their commanding Jedi generals across the galaxy, while Vader and a battalion of clone troopers kill the remaining Jedi in the Jedi Temple. Vader travels to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders, while Palpatine declares himself Emperor before the Galactic Senate, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire. He denounces the Jedi as traitors.\n\n\nObi-Wan and Yoda return to Coruscant and learn that Anakin has turned to the dark side. Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to confront Vader while he faces Palpatine. Obi-Wan seeks out Padmé to discover Vader's whereabouts and reveals his treachery. Padmé travels to Mustafar—unaware Obi-Wan has stowed aboard her ship—and pleads with Vader to abandon the dark side. When Obi-Wan emerges, an enraged Vader believes Padmé has betrayed him and strangles her. Obi-Wan and Vader engage in a lightsaber duel, which ends with Obi-Wan severing Vader's legs and left arm. Obi-Wan retrieves Vader's lightsaber before leaving him for dead near a lava flow.\n\n\nOn Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine, culminating in a stalemate. Yoda flees with Senator Bail Organa and regroups with Obi-Wan and Padmé on the planetoid Polis Massa. Padmé gives birth to twins, whom she names Luke and Leia. She dies soon after, still believing there is good in Vader. Palpatine recovers a barely-alive Vader. On Coruscant, Vader's badly burned and mutilated body is treated and encased in a black, armored life-support suit. When he asks about Padmé, Palpatine says Vader killed her out of rage, leaving Vader devastated.\n\n\nObi-Wan and Yoda conceal the twins' birth from the Sith and retreat into exile until the Empire can be challenged. As Padmé's funeral is underway on Naboo, Palpatine and Vader supervise the construction of the Death Star.[b] Bail takes Leia to Alderaan to raise her as his daughter. Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-uncle and step-aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, on Tatooine. Obi-Wan settles nearby as a recluse while watching over young Luke.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Ewan McGregor](image)\n![A photograph of Natalie Portman](image)\n![A photograph of Hayden Christensen](image)\n![A photograph of Ian McDiarmid](image)\n![A photograph of Samuel L.

He is decapitated by Anakin on the orders of his master.\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Anakin and Padmé's personal protocol droid that Anakin created as a child.[d]\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2, Anakin's astromech droid.\n* Frank Oz as the voice of Yoda, a Jedi Grandmaster and the leader of the Jedi Council.\n\n\nPeter Mayhew, Oliver Ford Davies, Ahmed Best, and Silas Carson reprise their roles as Chewbacca, Sio Bibble, Jar Jar Binks, and Nute Gunray and Ki-Adi-Mundi, respectively, from the previous films. Joel Edgerton and Bonnie Piesse also make cameo appearances, reprising their roles as Owen and Beru Lars respectively from *Attack of the Clones*. Sound engineer Matthew Wood provides the voice of General Grievous, the fearsome cyborg commander of the Separatists' droid army, who had been trained in wielding a lightsaber by Count Dooku. Wood took over the role, after Gary Oldman was originally cast in the role, but had to drop out of the production due to scheduling conflicts; Oldman had completed some voice-over work.[5][6] Temuera Morrison portrays Commander Cody and the rest of the clone troopers. Bruce Spence portrays Tion Medon, local administrator of Utapau. Jeremy Bulloch (who played Boba Fett in *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*) appears as Captain Colton, the pilot of the CR70 corvette *Tantive III*.[7] Genevieve O'Reilly portrays senator Mon Mothma, though her speaking scene was ultimately cut.[8][9][10][e] Rohan Nichol portrays Captain Raymus Antilles.[11]\n\n\nWayne Pygram appears as a young Wilhuff Tarkin, and stunt coordinator Nick Gillard appears as a Jedi named Cin Drallig (his name spelled backward, without the 'k').[12] Editor Roger Barton's son Aidan Barton portrays Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa as infants.\n\n\nDirector and *Star Wars* creator George Lucas has a cameo as Baron Papanoida, a blue-faced alien in attendance at the Coruscant opera house.[13] Lucas' son Jett portrays Zett Jukassa, a young Jedi-in-training. One of Lucas' daughters, Amanda, appears as Terr Taneel, seen in a security hologram, while his other daughter Katie plays a blue-skinned Pantoran named Chi Eekway, visible when Palpatine arrives at the Senate after being saved by the Jedi and talking to Baron Papanoida at the opera house.[14][15] Christian Simpson appeared as a stunt double for Hayden Christensen.[16]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nLucas said he conceived the *Star Wars* saga's story in the form of a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points.[17] The film's climactic duel has its basis in the *Return of the Jedi* novelization, in which Obi-Wan recounts his battle with Vader that ended with the latter falling \"into a molten pit\".[18] Lucas began working on the screenplay for *Episode III* before the previous film, *Attack of the Clones*, was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets.[19] In *The Secret History of Star Wars*, Michael Kaminski surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically reorganized the plot. For example, instead of opening the film with a montage of Clone War battles, Lucas decided to focus on Anakin, ending the first act with him killing Count Dooku, an action that signals his turn to the dark side.[20]\n\n\nA significant number of fans speculated online about the episode title for the film with rumored titles including *Rise of the Empire*, *The Creeping Fear* (which was also named as the film's title on the official website on April Fool's 2004), and *Birth of the Empire*.[21] Eventually, *Revenge of the Sith* also became a title guessed by fans that George Lucas would indirectly confirm.[22] The title is a reference to *Revenge of the Jedi*, the original title of *Return of the Jedi*; Lucas changed the title scant weeks before the premiere of *Return of the Jedi*, declaring that a true Jedi could never seek revenge.[23]\n\n\nLucas had originally planned to include even more ties to the original trilogy, and wrote early drafts of the script in which a 10-year-old Han Solo appeared on Kashyyyk, but the role was not cast or shot. He also wrote a scene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he created him from midichlorians, and is thus his \"father\", a clear parallel to Vader's revelation to Luke in *The Empire Strikes Back*, but Lucas ejected this scene as well. Another planned scene by Lucas that was written during the early development of the film was a conversation between Master Yoda and the ghostly Qui-Gon Jinn, with Liam Neeson reprising his role as Jinn (he also hinted his possible appearance in the film).[24] However, the scene was never filmed and Neeson was never recorded, although the scene was present in the film's novelization.\n\n\nAfter principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more changes in Anakin's character, rewriting his turn to the dark side. Lucas accomplished this through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during pickups in London in 2004.[25] In the previous versions, Anakin had several reasons for turning to the dark side, one of which was his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic. Although this is still intact in the finished film, by revising and refilming many scenes, Lucas emphasized Anakin's desire to save Padmé from death. Thus, in the version that made it to theaters, Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padmé.[25]\n\n\n\n### Art design[edit]\n\n\nFor the Kashyyyk environment, the art department turned to the *Star Wars Holiday Special* for inspiration.[26] Over a period of months, Lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the film. He would later rewrite entire scenes and action sequences to correspond to certain designs he had chosen.[25] The designs were then shipped to the pre-visualization department to create moving CGI versions known as animatics. Ben Burtt would edit these scenes with Lucas in order to pre-visualize what the film would look like before the scenes were filmed.[25] The pre-visualization footage featured a basic raw CGI environment with equally unprocessed character models performing a scene, typically for action sequences. Steven Spielberg was brought in as a \"guest director\" for the film's climax, overseeing the pre-visualization of an unused version of the Utapau chase scene[27] and making art-design suggestions for the Order 66 assassinations as well as the Mustafar duel.[28][29][f] The pre-visualization and art department designs were sent to the production department to begin building sets, props and costumes.[25]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the first scene filmed was the final scene to appear in the film (shot during the filming of *Attack of the Clones* in 2000),[30][g] the first bulk of principal photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography at Shepperton Studios in Surrey and Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire from August 2004 to January 31, 2005.[25] The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand. The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.[25]\n\n\nWhile shooting key dramatic scenes, Lucas would often use an \"A camera\" and \"B camera\", or the \"V technique\", a process that involves shooting with two or more cameras at the same time in order to gain several angles of the same performance.[25] Using the HD technology developed for the film, the filmmakers were able to send footage to the editors the same day it was shot, a process that would require a full 24 hours had it been shot on film.[25] Footage featuring the planet Mustafar was given to editor Roger Barton, who was on location in Sydney cutting the climactic duel.\n\n\nHayden Christensen says Lucas asked him \"to bulk up and physically show the maturity that had taken place between the two films.\"[32] The actor says he worked out with a trainer in Sydney for three months and ate \"six meals a day and on every protein, weight gain supplement that man has created\" to go from 160 lb (73 kg) to 185 lb (84 kg).[33]\n\n\nChristensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it. They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As in the previous prequel film, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles.[34] The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.[17]\n\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* eventually became the first *Star Wars* film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a \"tall guy\" in the Darth Vader costume, but, after \"begging and pleading\", Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit.[35] It also required Christensen (who is 6 feet or 1.8 metres tall) to look through the helmet's mouthpiece.[36]\n\n\nIn 2004, Gary Oldman was originally approached to provide the voice of General Grievous;[37] however, complications arose during contract negotiations after Oldman learned the film was to be made outside of the Screen Actors Guild, of which he is a member. He backed out of the role rather than violate the union's rules.[38] Matthew Wood, who voiced Grievous, disputed this story at Celebration III, held in Indianapolis. According to him, Oldman is a friend of producer Rick McCallum, and thus recorded an audition as a favor to him, but was not chosen.[39] Wood, who was also the supervising sound editor, was in charge of the auditions and submitted his audition anonymously in the midst of 30 others, under the initials \"A.S.\" for Alan Smithee.[40] Days later, he received a phone call asking for the full name to the initials \"A.S.\"[41]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nThe post-production department (handled by Industrial Light & Magic) began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in 2005. Special effects were created using almost all formats, including model work, CGI and practical effects. The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenes—both processes taking nearly two years to complete. *Revenge of the Sith* has 2,151 shots that use special effects, a world record.[42]\n\n\nThe DVD featurette *Within a Minute* illustrated the film required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone.[25] Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special look into the production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during the time it was operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.[43]\n\n\n\n### Deleted scenes[edit]\n\n\nLucas excised all scenes of a group of Senators, including Padmé, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly), organizing an alliance to prevent Palpatine from usurping any more emergency powers. Though this is essentially the birth of the Rebel Alliance, the scenes were discarded to achieve more focus on Anakin's story.[17] The scene where Yoda arrives on Dagobah to begin his self-imposed exile was also removed, but is featured as an extended scene in the DVD release, although McCallum stated he hoped Lucas would have added it to the new cut as part of a six-episode DVD box set.[17]\n\n\nBai Ling filmed minor scenes for the film playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed this was because she appeared in a nude pictorial for the June 2005 issue of *Playboy*, whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the film's May release. Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier, and that he had cut his own daughter's scenes as well.[44] The bonus features show an additional removed scene in which Jedi Master Shaak Ti is killed by General Grievous in front of Obi-Wan and Anakin.[45] The bonus features also show Obi-Wan and Anakin running through Grievous' ship, escaping droids through a fuel tunnel, and arguing over what R2-D2 is saying.[17]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (soundtrack)\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by John Williams (who has composed and conducted the score for every episode in the *Star Wars* saga), and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices in February 2005.[46] The film's soundtrack was released by Sony Pictures Classical Records on May 3, 2005, more than two weeks before the film's release. A music video titled *A Hero Falls* was created for the film's theme, \"Battle of the Heroes\", featuring footage from the film and was also available on the DVD.[47]\n\n\nThe soundtrack also came with a collectors' DVD, *Star Wars: A Musical Journey*, at no additional cost. The DVD, hosted by McDiarmid, features 16 music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores, set chronologically through the saga.[48]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![George Lucas lying on a sofa in hotel room with a pillow on his lap.](image)George Lucas in 2005. Portrait by Oliver Mark.\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe first trailer for *Revenge of the Sith* premiered in theaters on November 5, 2004 with the release of *The Incredibles*.[49] It was also attached to the screenings of *The Polar Express*, *National Treasure*, *Alexander*, *Ocean's Twelve*, *Meet the Fockers*, *Flight of the Phoenix* and other films. At the same time, the trailer became available on the Internet.[50] Just four months later, another trailer was unveiled on March 10, 2005, debuting with *The O.C.*'s \"The Mallpisode\" during the second season (Lucas himself would appear in a later episode) and in theaters with the release of *Robots* the next day on March 11. On March 14, it would then premiere on the official *Star Wars* website.[51] Three days after that on March 17, George Lucas revealed a preview of the film at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas, saying \"It's not like the old *Star Wars*. This one's a little bit emotional. We like to describe it as *Titanic* in space. It's a tearjerker.\"[52]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* charity premieres took place in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Miami on Thursday, May 12, 2005;[53] and on May 13, 2005, there were two additional charity premiere screenings in George Lucas's hometown of Modesto, California. The official premiere was at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival (out of competition) on May 16.[54] Its theatrical release in most other countries took place on May 19 to coincide with the 1999 release of *The Phantom Menace* (the 1977 release of *A New Hope* and the 1983 release of *Return of the Jedi* were also released on the same day and month, six years apart). The global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas claimed one week before the premiere that it may have cost the U.S. economy approximately US$627 million in lost productivity because of employees who took a day off or reported in sick.[55] Grauman's Chinese Theatre, a traditional venue for the *Star Wars* films, did not show it. However, a line of people stood there for more than a month hoping to convince someone to change this.[56] Most of them took advantage of an offer to see the film at a nearby cinema, ArcLight Cinemas (formerly the \"Cinerama Dome\").[57] On May 16, the Empire Cinema in London's Leicester Square hosted a day-long Star Wars marathon showing of all six films; an army of Imperial stormtroopers \"guarded\" the area, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra gave a free concert of *Star Wars* music.[58]\n\n\n\n### Leaked workprint[edit]\n\n\nA copy of the film leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it may have come from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening.[59] Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a copy of the film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges.[60] The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.[61]\n\n\n\n### Rating[edit]\n\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* is the first *Star Wars* film to receive a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), officially for \"sci-fi violence and some intense images\",[62] namely for the scene in which Darth Vader is set aflame by lava. Lucas had stated months before the MPAA's decision that he felt the film should receive a PG-13 rating, because of Anakin's final moments and the film's content being the darkest and most intense of all six films.[63] Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper later opined that children would be able to handle the film as long as they had parental guidance.[64] All previously released films in the series were rated PG.[62][h]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* was released on DVD and VHS on October 31, 2005, in the UK and Ireland; on November 1, 2005, it was released in the United States and Canada on DVD; and on November 3, 2005, it was released in Australia. It was also released in most major territories on or near the same day.[65] The DVD release consists of widescreen and pan and scan full-screen versions and is THX certified. This two-disc set contains one disc with the film and the other one with bonus features. The first disc features three randomized selected menus, which are Coruscant, Utapau and Mustafar.[66] There is an Easter egg in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, a hip hop music video with Yoda and some clone troopers will play.[67]\n\n\nThe DVD includes a number of documentaries including a new full-length documentary as well as two featurettes, one which explores the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker as the Chosen One, the other looking at the film's stunts and a 15-part collection of web-documentaries from the official web site. Like the other DVD releases, included is an audio commentary track featuring Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, animation director Rob Coleman, and ILM visual effects supervisors John Knoll and Roger Guyett. Six deleted scenes were included with introductions from Lucas and McCallum.\n\n\nThis release is notable because, due to marketing issues, it was the first *Star Wars* film never to be released on VHS in the United States.[68] However, the film was released on VHS in Australia, the U.K. and other countries.[69][*better source needed*]\n\n\nThe DVD was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[70]\n\n\nThe six *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray on September 16, 2011, in three different editions.[71]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *Revenge of the Sith* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play, and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[72]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued *Revenge of the Sith* on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on September 22, 2019.[73] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[74] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 31, 2020 whilst being re-released on Blu-ray and DVD.[75]\n\n\n\n### 3D re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series were to be stereo-converted to 3D. The films would be re-released in chronological order beginning with *The Phantom Menace* on February 10, 2012. *Revenge of the Sith* was originally scheduled to be re-released in 3D on October 11, 2013.[76][i] However, on January 28, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that it was postponing the 3D release of episodes *II* and *III* in order to \"focus 100 percent of our efforts on *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\" and that further information about 3D release plans would be issued at a later date.[78][79][80] The premiere of the 3D version was shown on April 17, 2015, at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim.[81]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 305 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*, George Lucas brings his second *Star Wars* trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant – if still a bit uneven – conclusion.\"[82] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[83] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the previous two films.[84]\n\n\nMost critics have considered the film to be the best of the prequel trilogy.[85] A. O. Scott of *The New York Times* concluded that it was \"the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed\", and equal to *The Empire Strikes Back* as \"the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle\".[86] J.R. Jones, a *Chicago Reader* critic who disliked *The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones*, gave the film a positive review, saying that it had a \"relatively thoughtful story\".[87] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing \"If [Lucas] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in *Episode II: Attack of the Clones*, the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and *Revenge of the Sith* is a great entertainment\", but he noted that \"the dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point\".[88]\n\n\nThough many critics and fans viewed *Revenge of the Sith* as the strongest of the three prequels, some viewers thought it was more or less on par with the previous two episodes.[85] Much of the criticism was directed towards the dialogue, particularly the film's romantic scenes;[89][90] critics claimed this demonstrated Lucas's weakness as a writer of dialogue, a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.[90] Some film critics and fans criticized Hayden Christensen's acting, calling it \"wooden\".[91][89][92][93] A retrospective review by *Time* felt that Christensen's maligned performance was in part affected by the screenwriting.[94]\n\n\n\n### Other responses[edit]\n\n\nSome American conservatives criticized the film, claiming it had a liberal bias and was a commentary on the George W. Bush administration and Iraq War. Some websites went so far as to propose a boycott of the film.[95] Lucas defended the film, stating that the film's storyline was written during the Vietnam War and was influenced by that conflict rather than the war in Iraq. Lucas also said \"The parallels between Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable\".[95]\n\n\nArt critic Camille Paglia praised the film as an essential example of the modern digital art movement due to its \"overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness\", and arguing that its finale has \"more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact\" than the work of some contemporary artists.[96][97][98]\n\n\nDuring the late 2010s, the film amassed a cult following on social media among young fans who were children when the film was released, using the film's dialogue to create Internet memes out of nostalgia.[99]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released in 115 countries. Its worldwide gross eventually reached $849 million—making it the second most financially successful film of 2005,[2] behind *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*.[100] The film earned an estimated $16.91 million from 2,900 midnight screenings in North America upon its release. In total, it earned a record $50 million on its opening day,[101] marking the record for the highest opening-day gross on a Thursday.[102] It was surpassed the following year by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*, which earned $55.5 million on its opening day.[103]\n\n\nWith only the May 19 earnings, the film broke four box office records: midnight screenings gross (previously held by *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, $8 million), opening day gross (*Spider-Man 2*, with $40.4 million), single day gross (*Shrek 2* with $44.8 million) and Thursday gross (*The Matrix Reloaded* with $37.5 million).[101] Its single day and opening day gross records were later surpassed by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* on July 7, 2006, when that movie grossed $55.5 million on its opening day,[103] and its midnight screening gross was broken by *The Dark Knight* on July 18, 2008 with $18.5 million.[104] With a total gross of $108.4 million, *Revenge of the Sith* would go on to hold the record for having the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film for a decade until it was taken by *Deadpool* in 2016.[105] The year prior, *Minions* had already surpassed *Revenge of the Sith* for having the largest opening weekend for a prequel.[106]\n\n\nAccording to box office analysis sites, the film set American records for highest gross in a given number of days for each of its first 12 days of release except for the seventh and eighth, where the record is narrowly held by *Spider-Man 2*. Within three days, *Revenge of the Sith* surpassed *Spider-Man* for having the highest three-day gross of any film, scoring a total of $124.7 million.[107] On its fifth day, it became the highest-grossing film of 2005, surpassing *Hitch* ($177.6 million). The film earned $158.5 million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by *The Matrix Reloaded* ($134.3 million), and joining the latter film, *Spider-Man*, and *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* as one of the only four films to make $100 million in their first three days. In eight days, it reached the $200 million mark (a record tied with *Spider-Man 2*) and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300 million (surpassing the record of 18 days of *Shrek 2*). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after *Shrek 2* and *Spider-Man*) to reach $350 million.[2] *Revenge of the Sith* earned a total of $55.2 million during its second weekend, making it the fourth-highest-grossing second weekend of all time, behind *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, *Spider-Man* and *Shrek 2*. The film then earned $70 million in just four days, becoming the seventh-highest Memorial Day weekend gross of any film, trailing only behind *Shrek 2*, *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*, *The Day After Tomorrow*, *Bruce Almighty*, *Pearl Harbor* and *Mission: Impossible 2*.[108]\n\n\nThe film ended its run in American theaters on October 20, 2005,[2] finishing with a total gross of $380,270,577. It ranks 29th in all-time domestic grosses and is the highest-grossing U.S. of 2005, out-grossing second-place *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* by nearly $90 million.[2] The film sold an estimated 59,324,600 tickets in the US. It topped the domestic box office for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by *Madagascar* and *The Longest Yard* (which were in their second weekend).[109]\n\n\nInternational grosses that exceeded $460 million include those Australia ($27.2 million), France and Algeria ($56.9 million), Germany ($47.3 million), Italy ($11.3 million), Japan ($82.7 million), Mexico ($15.3 million), South Korea ($10.3 million), Spain ($23.8 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($72.8 million).[110] The total worldwide opening of *Revenge of the Sith* for each country was $254 million, combined with $304 million from its four-day weekend. It would go on to hold this record for two years before *Spider-Man 3* took it in 2007.[111]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Revenge of the Sith*—the completion of the original and prequel *Star Wars* series—on June 9, 2005, George Lucas was presented with the 33rd American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award. The institute honored his \"astonishing contributions to the art and technology of filmmaking, as well as the impact of the epic Star Wars series\".[112]\n\n\nDespite being the prequel trilogy's best reviewed and received film, it received fewer award nominations than the previous films. It became the only *Star Wars* film not to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects; it was nominated for Best Makeup (Dave Elsey and Nikki Gooley), losing to *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*.[113] It also won \"Favorite Motion Picture\" and \"Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture\" awards at the People's Choice Awards,[114] \"Hollywood Movie of the Year\" award at the Hollywood Film Festival,[115] Empire Awards for Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film and Scene of the Year (The birth of Vader),[116] and the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie – Action.[117]\n\n\nAs did every film of the original trilogy, the film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.[118] Williams also won Best Music. The film was nominated for ten Saturn Awards overall, including Best Director and Best Writing for Lucas, Best Actor for Christensen, Best Actress for Natalie Portman, and Best Supporting Actor for Ian McDiarmid.[119]\n\n\nOf the three *Star Wars* prequels, the film received the fewest Golden Raspberry Awards nominations: only one, for Christensen as Worst Supporting Actor,[120] which he won.[121] (*The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones* received seven nominations each, with one and two wins, respectively.) It is the only *Star Wars* prequel not to receive a Razzie nomination for Worst Picture. Christensen further won the \"Best Villain\" award at the MTV Movie Awards.[122] The film also received the fewest nominations (and no wins) at the 2005 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards: Worst Screenplay for a Film Grossing More Than $100M, and Worst On-Screen Couple (Christensen and Portman).[123]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\nThroughout *Revenge of the Sith*, Lucas refers to a wide range of films and other sources, drawing on political, military, and mythological motifs to enhance his story's impact. The most media coverage was likely given to an exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan, leading to the aforementioned conflict: \"If you're not with me, then you're my enemy\", Anakin declares. Despite Lucas' insistence to the contrary, *The Seattle Times* concluded, \"Without naming Bush or the Patriot Act, it's all unmistakable no matter what your own politics may be.\"[124]\n\n\nMcDiarmid, Lucas, and others have also called Anakin's journey to the dark side Faustian in the sense of making a \"pact with the devil\" for short-term gain, with the fiery volcano planet Mustafar representing hell.[125] Midway through the film, Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padmé by themselves, thinking about one another in the Jedi Temple and their apartment, respectively, during sunset. The sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a moody, synthesized soundtrack. Lucas' coverage of the exterior cityscapes, skylines and interior isolation in the so-called \"Ruminations\" sequence is similar to the cinematography and *mise-en-scène* of *Rosemary's Baby*, a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil.[126]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Novelization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (novel)\n\nThe film's novelization was written by Matthew Stover. It has more dialogue than the film, and certain story elements were expanded upon in the novelization including Anakin and Palpatine's relationship and Palpatine's apprenticeship to Darth Plagueis.[127]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (video game)\n\nA video game based on the film was released on May 5, 2005, two weeks before the film. The game generally followed the film's storyline, integrating scenes from the film. However, many sections of the game featured scenes cut from the film, or entirely new scenes for the game.[128] The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi-Wan or Anakin.[129] It also has a form of multiplayer mode, which includes both \"VS\" and \"Cooperative\" mode.[129] In the first mode, two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death. In the latter mode, two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.[129]\n\n\n\n### *The Clone Wars*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)\n\nThe 2008 animated film and subsequent television series fill the three-year gap between the events of *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith*. A number of plot threads initially developed for inclusion in *Revenge of the Sith* were instead incorporated into *The Clone Wars*. These include Boba Fett's revenge plot against Mace Windu for his father Jango's death, and the solving of the mystery behind deceased Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas which was introduced in *Attack of the Clones*. The final four episodes of the series take place concurrently with *Revenge of the Sith*. Several scenes from the film were recreated and expanded for these episodes in order to showcase the whereabouts of Anakin Skywalker's former Padawan Ahsoka Tano during the events of the film. While Ahsoka was a major character in *The Clone Wars*, she is not referenced in *Revenge of the Sith* as the character had not yet been created at the time that the film was written.[130]\n\n\n\n### *The Bad Batch*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: The Bad Batch\n\nSeveral scenes from *Revenge of the Sith* were recreated in the first episode *Aftermath*. This episode also takes place concurrently with the film and the following episodes deal with the aftermath of Order 66 and the Clone Wars.\n\n\n\n### *Obi-Wan Kenobi*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)\n\nThe 2022 miniseries takes place ten years after *Revenge of the Sith* (and approximately nine years before *A New Hope*),[j] and features flashbacks taking place prior and during the events of the film, with some of the latter via archive footage. McGregor, Christensen, Earl Jones, Edgerton, Piesse, Smits, McDiarmid, and Daniels reprise their roles from the film.[131]\n\n\n\n### *Backstroke of the West*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, a fandub of *Revenge of the Sith* was released titled *Star War [*sic*] the Third Gathers: Backstroke of the West*. The script used in the fandub was the result of an inaccurate machine translation of the Mandarin Chinese version of the *Revenge of the Sith* script back into English, resulting in nonsensical Chinglish.[132] The script originated from an American who found a DVD copy of Revenge of the Sith in Shanghai.[133] The dub became an Internet meme and a viral video, and received praise from multiple news outlets. Patrick Shanley from The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"a fan-made masterpiece\",[132] while Julia Alexander from Polygon called the dub \"hilarious\".[134] Derrick Rossignol from Nerdist went so far as to say that the fandub was \"way better\" than the original film.[135]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in the 2008 television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*\n2. **^** As depicted in *Star Wars* (1977)\n3. **^** Jones himself has never confirmed his participation.

Abrams. The sequel to *Return of the Jedi* (1983), it is the seventh film in the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set thirty years after *Return of the Jedi*, *The Force Awakens* follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire. The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.\n\n\nThe film was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18. It was positively received by critics, who found it an action-packed film with the mix of new and familiar actors capturing the nostalgia of the original trilogy and giving the franchise new energy.[4] The film grossed $2.07 billion worldwide, breaking various box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release. It was nominated for five awards at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The film was followed by *The Last Jedi* (2017) and *The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), rounding out the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThirty years after the Battle of Endor,[a] the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to end the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who is missing.\n\n\nOn the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke's location from an old ally. First Order stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village, capture Poe, and kill the villagers. Poe's droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters Rey, a lone scavenger. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned with the First Order, saves Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name \"Finn\". As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and assumes Poe was killed after finding his jacket in the wreck. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the *Millennium Falcon* and escape Jakku.\n\n\nThe *Falcon* is discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the *Falcon*. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke approves General Hux's request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.\n\n\nAboard the *Falcon*, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed Luke's temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travel to the planet Takodana and meet with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds Luke's lightsaber. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz's offering, and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\n\n\nStarkiller Base destroys the New Republic and its four neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey, having realized that she had seen the map, and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper guard.\n\n\nAt the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been in low-power mode since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the *Falcon*, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth-name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han. Chewbacca shoots Kylo, injuring him, and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator.\n\n\nKylo pursues Rey and Finn into the woods. He incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is quickly defeated. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and defeats Kylo in a duel. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca saves Rey and the injured Finn, and they escape aboard the *Falcon*. As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes and erupts into a star. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which points to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.\n\n\nRey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 travel to Ahch-To on the *Falcon*. Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island and silently presents him with his lightsaber.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Star Wars* characters and List of *Star Wars* cast members\n\n![](image)The cast of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con International\n* Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A smuggler and captain of the *Millennium Falcon*[5][6]\n* Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: The last Jedi, who has gone into hiding[7][8]\n* Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: A leader of the Resistance[9][10]\n* Adam Driver as Kylo Ren: A leader of the Knights of Ren and a warlord of the First Order, who is the son of Han and Leia[11][12][13]\n* Daisy Ridley as Rey: A Force-sensitive scavenger[14]\n\t+ Cailey Fleming as young Rey[15]\n* John Boyega as Finn: A reformed First Order stormtrooper[14]\n* Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: A high-ranking X-wing fighter pilot of the Resistance[14][16]\n* Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata: A centuries-old and perceptive alien who owns a castle on the peaceful forest planet Takodana[17][18]\n* Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke: An enigmatic, genetically artificial leader of the First Order[14][19]\n* Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux: The commander of the First Order's Starkiller Base[14]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A humanoid protocol droid[20]\n* Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: Han's loyal Wookiee friend and co-pilot[21][22]\n\t+ Joonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems[23][24]\n* Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: A galactic explorer searching for Luke Skywalker[25][26]\n\n\nTim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb from *Return of the Jedi*, with Erik Bauersfeld and Kipsang Rotich returning their respective voices.[15] Kenny Baker, originally announced as part of the cast, was credited as \"consultant\" for R2-D2,[27][15] with Jimmy Vee performing some of the work for R2-D2.[28] Ewan McGregor has an uncredited vocal cameo as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Rey's vision sequence, while archival audio of Frank Oz and Alec Guinness as Yoda and Kenobi, respectively, are also used in the same scene; Oz recorded new dialogue for the film, but it was replaced with preexisting audio from *The Empire Strikes Back*.[29] *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* voice actor James Arnold Taylor, who has voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi in different *Star Wars* media, originally recorded Kenobi's dialogue, but his recordings were replaced with McGregor's.[30]\n\n\nGwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma, the commander of the First Order's legions of stormtroopers.[31][32] Dave Chapman and Brian Herring served as puppeteers for BB-8,[33] with Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz credited as \"Vocal Consultants\".[34] Ken Leung appears as Statura, an admiral in the Resistance.[35] Simon Pegg appears as Unkar Plutt, the Junk parts dealer on Jakku.[36][37] Greg Grunberg plays Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley, an X-wing pilot.[38][39] Kiran Shah plays Teedo, a scavenger on Jakku who rides a semi-mechanical Luggabeast.[15][40] Jessica Henwick appears as Jess \"Testor\" Pava or Jess Testor, an X-wing pilot.[41][42][43] Brian Vernel appears as Bala-Tik, the leader of the Guavian Death Gang.[44] Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais appear as Tasu Leech and Razoo Qin-Fee, members of the Kanjiklub Gang, a criminal organization.[15] Warwick Davis appears as Wollivan, a tavern-dweller in Maz Kanata's castle.[45][46] Anna Brewster appears as Bazine Netal, a First Order spy, also at Maz Kanata's castle.[15] Hannah John-Kamen appears as a First Order officer.[15] Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Kate Fleetwood play First Order Petty Officers, Thanisson and Unamo, respectively.[47][48] Billie Lourd, daughter of Carrie Fisher, appears as Connix, a lieutenant in the Resistance.[49][50] Members of the Resistance include Emun Elliott as Brance[51] and Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Korr Sella[52] while Harriet Walter appears as Kalonia, the doctor who tends to Chewbacca.[53][54] Mark Stanley appears as a Knight of Ren.[54] Sebastian Armesto portrays Lieutenant Mitaka and Pip Torrens portrays Colonel Kaplan, both serving the First Order.[15]\n\n\nDaniel Craig, Michael Giacchino, and Nigel Godrich cameo as stormtroopers.[55][56] Abrams' assistant, Morgan Dameron, appears as a Resistance officer,[57] while his father, Gerald W.

Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer.[69] Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film.[71][72][73] Lucas' son Jett told *The Guardian* that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation\".[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: producer Kathleen Kennedy, writer and director J. J. Abrams, and writer Lawrence Kasdan speaking at 2015 San Diego Comic-Con\n*The Force Awakens*' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.[75] At the time of his hiring, Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments.[76] Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg, Lawrence Kasdan, Pablo Hidalgo, and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy.[77] Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\"[78] The writers decided to use Luke as the film's MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene.[78] Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel *Star Wars: Bloodline*).[79]\n\n\nSeveral directors were considered, including David Fincher,[80] Brad Bird,[81] Jon Favreau,[82] and Guillermo del Toro.[83] Bird was reportedly the \"top choice\" to helm the film, but his commitments to *Tomorrowland* forced him to withdraw.[84] Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job, even dropping out of *X-Men: Days of Future Past* in favor for the film.[85] Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio, while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project.[86][87][88][89] After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy,[90] J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013,[91] with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.[92] Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer.[93][94] Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.[95] The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013. That same day, Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties,[96] both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, California, New York City, Paris, and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks.[97] Abrams said the key to the film was that it return to the roots of the first *Star Wars* films and be based more on emotion than explanation.[98] In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.[99] In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that *Episodes VII–IX* would not feature storylines from the *Star Wars* expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series *Star Wars Rebels*.[100]\n\n\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from *The Force Awakens*, such as Rey and Finn's last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams was collaborating with *The Last Jedi* director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with *The Rise of Skywalker*'s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that \"everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\".[101] Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.[102]\n\n\nA fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\"; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.[103]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been \"keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\"[104] He also said, \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different [...] I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\"[105][106] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told *The Hollywood Reporter* that Lucas had seen the movie and \"liked it\".[107] In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, \"I think the fans are going to love it, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for.\"[108] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous *Star Wars* films.[109]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that *The Force Awakens* would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce *The Force Awakens* in the UK.[110] Osborne committed £25 million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry.[111] According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, *The Force Awakens* ultimately received a total of £31.6 million ($47.4 million) from the government.[112][113]\n\n\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of *The Force Awakens* for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[114] The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films *Star Trek* (2009) and *Star Trek Into Darkness* (2013).[115] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[116] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[117] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.[118]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nOpen auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of \"Rachel\" and \"Thomas\".[119] Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.[120] Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement.[121] Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013,[69] their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.[27]\n\n\nAbrams set out to have a more diverse cast than previous installments.[122] A very early report claimed the studio wanted Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron for roles.[123][124] In September 2013, Michael B. Jordan, Saoirse Ronan, and David Oyelowo were among the first to meet with the director.[125] In January 2014, *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed Benedict Cumberbatch, Jack O'Connell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alex Pettyfer, Jesse Plemons, Sullivan Stapleton, Tye Sheridan, Hugo Weaving, Michael Fassbender, and Adam Driver all met with Abrams for the film. The role Sheridan met for was ultimately rewritten to be played by a 40 year old actor, while Weaving was in talks for an \"Imperial commander\".[126] Ronan, Jordan, Frida Gustavsson, and later Miles Teller would go on to confirm their auditions for the film.[127][128][129][130] Industry publications speculated that Plemons could possibly be playing Luke Skywalker's son.[131] In February, Driver was in final negotiations for an unnamed villain, while Gary Oldman revealed he was approached for an undisclosed role.[132][133] In March, John Boyega, Plemons, Ray Fisher, Matthew James Thomas and Ed Speleers were Abrams' top choice for the lead role.[122] Boyega began talks after dropping out of the Jesse Owens biopic *Race*.[121] That same month, Lupita Nyong'o was said to have met also met with Abrams for the female lead.[134] In April 2014, Plemons and Thomas were no longer in contention for the film.[135] That same month, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, an \"unknown Oxford actress\", and Dev Patel were up for unknown roles.[136][137] Ronan, Richardson-Sellers, Eiza Gonzalez, Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Henwick auditioned for Rey.[138][139][140][141] Joseph David-Jones, Tom Holland, and Daryl McCormack were later reported to have auditioned for Finn while McCormack made it to the final round of auditions for the part.[142][143][144] Eddie Redmayne and Joel Kinnaman tested for Kylo Ren.[145][146]\n\n\nDaisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his *Girls* schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April.[121] Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have \"bored\" him.[147]\n\n\nIn April, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow were announced as part of the cast; while Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Baker reprised their roles from the original trilogy.[27] In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.[31] To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.[148] Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.[148] Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO,[149] but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him.[150] A flashback scene was cut from Rey's vision (following her discovery of Luke's lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in *The Empire Strikes Back*.[151]\n\n\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the *Star Wars* set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.[152] In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in *Return of the Jedi*, as well as Wald and Weazle in *The Phantom Menace* (1999), announced that he would appear in *The Force Awakens*, but did not reveal his role.[153] In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film.[49] Lourd first auditioned for the role of Rey prior to her casting.[154]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rub' Al Khali desert around Liwa Oasis in the United Arab Emirates was used as filming location for planet Jakku.\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.[98] The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[155] That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.[156] In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,[157] filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit.[158] Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35 mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format.[159] In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.[160]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.[161] The budget was initially estimated to be between $259 million and $306 million,[112][162] but in 2023 the actual cost was revealed to be $447 million.[2] Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built on location—including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market—and where explosives were used to create a \"blast crater\". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.[163] Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.[164]\n\n\n\n![view over Skellig Michael showing stone beehive structures and Small Skellig island in the distance](image)\n![concrete missile silo covered in grass](image)\nSkellig Michael in Ireland (top) and former RAF Greenham Common in England served as filming locations.\n\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the *Millennium Falcon* set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle\".[95] Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford's injury.[165] Ford's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.[166] A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly.[167] Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident,[95] but he kept this to himself for over a month.[168] In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.[169] Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.[170]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.[171] Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England.[172] Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August.[173][174] In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships.[175][176] Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes.[177] Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.[178]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, where Abrams supervised post-production of the film\nKennedy said *The Force Awakens* would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery.[179] Johnson reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\"[180] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original *Star Wars*.[181] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research,[182] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[183][184] The Holochess sequence was created using stop-motion, which was supervised by Tippett Studio and overseen by Phil Tippett, who also worked on the stop-motion sequence in the original *Star Wars* film.[185][186]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's *Star Wars* films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.[187] Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.[95] In August 2015, he gave the film's estimated running time of 124 minutes.[188] Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value [...] So we ended up leaving those things out.\"[189] The final cut of the film runs for 138 minutes.[190]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[191] In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the *Star Wars* universe, revealed that the working title for the film was *Shadow of the Empire* \"for the longest time\".[192]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (soundtrack)\n\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with *The Force Awakens*.[193] He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.[194][195] In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that \"there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.[196]\n\n\nRecording sessions for *The Force Awakens* began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.[197] The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.[198] Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.[199]\n\n\nThe score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score's part for nearly an hour. Williams' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus.[200] Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.[201] Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.[202] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.[203] Williams' score is more than two hours long.[195]\n\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical *Hamilton*, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.[204]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nDisney backed *The Force Awakens* with extensive marketing campaigns.[205][206] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the media value was $175 million;[207] its costs alongside home media revenues had later risen to $423 million by *The Guardian*.[208] On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store,[209] generating 58.2 million views on YouTube in its first week.[210] Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. *The Hollywood Reporter* called the trailer \"perfectly potent nostalgia\", praising its mix of old and new.[211] *Empire* was impressed by the continuity with the first films—\"the *feel* of classic *Star Wars*\"—but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters.[212] *The Guardian* wrote that the use of the *Star Wars* fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Large-scale outdoor advertising for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* in the city center of Nuremberg, Germany\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters.[214] On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the *Star Wars* Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was \"staggering [...] the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to—other than a rock concert—that felt quite like that\".[215] The trailer was viewed over 88 million times within the first 24 hours of release.[216] The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. *The Huffington Post*'s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer \"was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.\"[217]\n\n\n*Vanity Fair* was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to *The Force Awakens*. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz.[218] At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of *The Guardian* writing: \"The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.\" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, *Super 8*, saying \"the promos [...] are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.\"[219]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at *The Force Awakens* at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015.[220] Drew Struzan—who designed the poster artwork for the previous *Star Wars* films—produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees.[221] In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like \"orb\".[222] The trailer debuted during the halftime break of *Monday Night Football*, before being released online.[223] The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was \"frenzied\", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that \"perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals.\"[224] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* felt the trailer was \"a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned *Star Wars* aesthetic\".[225] The trailer received 128 million views in 24 hours. 16 million of the views came from its airing on *Monday Night Football*.[226] At the end of October, Air France announced a \"Flight and Cinema\" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film.[227] On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.[228]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a *Star Wars* marathon, airing the six previous *Star Wars* episode films in 2D, followed by *The Force Awakens* in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.[229]\n\n\n\n### Tie-in literature and merchandise[edit]\n\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, \"Journey to *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film's premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the *Star Wars* universe.[230] Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of *The Force Awakens* which was released in e-book form on December 18.[231] In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016.[231] Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of *The Force Awakens* between June and November 2016.[232]\n\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed \"Force Friday\" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for *The Force Awakens*. Beginning at 12:01 am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world.[233] Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015.[234][235] Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero.[182] Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling.[236][237] Many retailers, such as Toys \"R\" Us, were unable to meet demand for *Star Wars* products due to the event.[238]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSelect characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other *Star Wars* video games: Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts;[239] free downloadable content for Electronic Arts' *Star Wars Battlefront* reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku;[240] an update to the mobile game *Star Wars Commander*, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era;[241] and a condensed version of the film's plot becomes an add-on \"playset\" in the toys-to-life game *Disney Infinity 3.0*, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters.[242] Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled *Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.[243]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The premiere tent, with the film's poster above\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* premiered on December 14, 2015, at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[244] A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the \"massive\" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests.[245] The film was originally scheduled for a mid-2015 release, but in November 2013, it was pushed back to December 18, 2015.[246] It was also released in 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats.[247]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters,[248] of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations,[249][250] as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema.[251] Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record.[250] On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros.' *The Hobbit* trilogy to receive such a release.[252] The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of *The Revenant* (2015) and *The Finest Hours* (2016) in mid-January 2016.[253]\n\n\nAdvance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015,[254] and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing.[255][256] Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater.[257] In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day.[258] In total, it sold over $50 million in pre-sales, breaking the record.[259][260] This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14.[260][261] However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening [...] We have people buying *Star Wars* [*The Force Awakens*] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.\"[259] Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK,[262] Canada,[263] and Germany.[264]\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* is the first live-action *Star Wars* film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.[265] Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[3] and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles.[266] Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was \"for the fans\".[267]\n\n\nA poster from mainland China was criticized for being racist due to shrinking the size of the Black character Finn compared to non-Chinese posters.[268][269][270]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* through digital download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 5. Physical copies include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews,[271] and additional footage with eight bonus features.[272] In its first week, *The Force Awakens* sold 669,318 DVDs and 3.4 million Blu-rays as the most sold film on both formats in the United States.[273] That same week, *The Force Awakens* topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart with 83% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray.[274] Overall, *The Force Awakens* sold 2.1 million DVDs and 5.9 million Blu-rays, adding them up to get a total of 8 million copies, and made $191 million through home media releases.[273]\n\n\nA Blu-ray 3D \"collector's edition\" of the film was released on November 15, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by director J. J. Abrams.[275] The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features.[275]\n\n\nThe movie was rereleased on DVD in 2019 as part of the 9-disc \"Skywalker Saga\" boxed set. It received a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release on March 31, 2020. This 4K release was then included in the 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set on April 20, 2020.[276]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast syndication[edit]\n\n\nThe premium cable network Starz had U.S. broadcast syndication rights for *The Force Awakens* in January 2016,[277] just before the end of Starz's output deal covering most Disney films through 2015.[278] That September, *The Force Awakens* began broadcasting on all Starz networks.[279]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* grossed $936.7 million in the United States and Canada and $1.132 billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068 billion,[3] making it the highest-grossing film of 2015[280] and the third highest-grossing film of all time.[281] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110 million tickets in the United States and Canada.[282] *The Force Awakens* earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by *Titanic* in 1997.[283] It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days.[284] It was also the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.[285] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $780.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[162]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first *Star Wars* film made more when this adjustment is made.[286] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[286]\n\n\nWhile *The Force Awakens* was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as India, other certain parts of Asia and Latin America. This was attributed to it being \"a retro film\" and how overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in North America.[287][288][289] The *Star Wars* franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for *The Force Awakens* heavily focused on appealing to that market.[288][290]\n\n\nNancy Tartaglione of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, *The Force Awakens* did well overseas.[289] While the film had special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also stated that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done.[288] Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [*The Force Awakens*] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\"[287] Moreover, Mike Fleming Jr. of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.00\".[291]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *The Force Awakens* was released on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews,[b] of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens.[295] On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record[296] and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day.[297] Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross[298] and a record of $247.9 million for its opening weekend.[273] The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders *The Avengers* (2012) ($207 million) and *Jurassic World* (2015) ($208 million).[299] The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters,[300][301] which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by *Return of the Jedi*—the second-lowest-grossing film in the series—in its original run.[302] 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record.[300] At that time, the film had the biggest December opening weekend, breaking the previous record held by *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012).[303] It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021) six years later.[304] Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office[305] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.[306]\n\n\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following *Avatar*) to gross over $700 million in the United States and Canada,[307] and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.[308] On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation.[309] On February 5, *The Force Awakens* became the first film to earn over $900 million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada.[310][311] The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26–28, 2016,[312][313] and did not achieve $1 million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.[314]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.[315] It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.[316] It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6 million for a two-day international total of $72.7 million, reaching first place in all 44 markets.[317] It grossed a total of $129.5 million in three days after adding $56.8 million on its third day,[317] and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6 million.[318] It broke opening-day records in the United Kingdom ($14.4 million), Germany ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million),[295] Sweden ($1.7 million), Norway ($1.1 million),[316] and in 12 other countries.[318] Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million) and Japan ($3 million).[317] After the five days, *The Force Awakens* had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening[315][319] and the third-biggest international opening of all time.[320] International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million), Japan ($13.4 million), and Russia ($12.3 million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.[315][321]\n\n\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history—after *Jurassic World*—that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally.[319][322] This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million.[322] Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 11 days.[323] IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters.[301] The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million.[324] The film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million.[325] As of February 2016, the highest-grossing markets outside of the United States and Canada were the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million), and France ($88.2 million).[326] On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.[327] It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by *The Revenant* in its sixth weekend.[328] In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.[328]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.[329] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 453 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, *The Force Awakens* successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy\".[4] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[330] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it either an \"A\" or a \"B\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% \"definite recommend\" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.[331]\n\n\nRobbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* said the film \"sets out to shake *Star Wars* from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past\", and \"it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\"[332] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* said that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot\", and it was \"ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\"[333] *Variety*'s Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans.\"[334] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* described it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure\".[335] Ann Hornaday, writing for *The Washington Post*, thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans\", and the film struck \"all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\"[336] *The Charlotte Observer*'s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\"[337] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best *Star Wars* sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015\".[338] Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best *Star Wars* film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike\".[339]\n\n\nTom Long of *The Detroit News* wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original *Star Wars*, it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind\", and \"the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured\".[340] The Tribune-Star called it \"basically the same\" as the original film but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"[341] Stephanie Zacharek of *Time* wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted\".[342] Reviewing for *Forbes*, Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture.\"[343] Brian Merchant of *Motherboard* said that the film \"is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod\", and that \"one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"[344] *RogerEbert.com*'s Gerardo Valero said the movie \"plagiarized\" *A New Hope* and resorted to nostalgia. He felt that it \"didn't [justify] a return to the universe\" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.[345]\n\n\n\n#### From *Star Wars* filmmakers[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a \"divorce\" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of *The Force Awakens*. Lucas described the previous *Star Wars* films as his \"children\" and criticized the \"retro feel\" of *The Force Awakens*, saying: \"I worked very hard to make [my films] completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships—you know, to make it new.\" Lucas also likened Disney to \"white slavers\", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized.[346][347] In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas \"couldn't even hide his disappointment\" towards J. J. Abrams' interpretation. According to Iger, Lucas said, \"there's nothing new\" after seeing the film, and that \"there weren't enough visual or technical leaps forward\".[348][349] Lucas preferred Rian Johnson's sequel *The Last Jedi* and the anthology film *Rogue One* (2016).[350][351]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of *The Force Awakens*, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies.[352] However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards' slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors,[353] and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of *The Force Awakens*,[352] where it was named one of the top-ten films of 2015.[354]\n\n\nAt the 88th Academy Awards, *The Force Awakens* received nominations for Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects.[355] The film's other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.[356][357]\n\n\n\n### Fan backlash[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(June 2023)*\n |\n\n\nThe release of the first film trailer for *The Force Awakens* in 2015 spurred a racial backlash against the casting of Boyega, a Black British actor, in such a prominent role.[358] Some social media users called for a boycott of the film, which they accused of being \"anti-white\"[359] and of promoting \"white genocide\".[360] One such account promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory.[361] The character of Rey was also criticized as a too-perfect \"Mary Sue\" character by a group of fans who became known as the \"Fandom Menace\", who focused their ire at Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, whom they accused of spoiling the film franchise by including \"forced diversity\" and pro-feminist politics.[362]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* and *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*\n\n*The Force Awakens* was followed by *The Last Jedi* in 2017.[363] The film's plot follows the Resistance escaping from the First Order.[364] Like the previous film, *The Last Jedi* was a financial success and fared well with critics.[365]\n\n\nA sequel to *The Last Jedi* was released in 2019, titled *The Rise of Skywalker*.[366] As the conclusion to the Skywalker narrative,[367] it focuses on the Resistance assault on the Final Order, a reorganized First Order.[364] Critics' reactions to *The Rise of Skywalker* were mixed.[368][369]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Return of the Jedi* (1983)\n2. **^** The $57 million figure incorporates revenues generated from the \"*Star Wars* Marathon Event\" from 135 theaters in which all previous six *Star Wars* films were shown along with *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*. Ticket prices cost $59.99 for all the films (including *The Force Awakens*) at an average of $8.57 per movie.[292][293][294]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\".

Produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the second installment of the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy, following *The Force Awakens* (2015), and the eighth episode of the nine-part \"Skywalker saga\". The film's ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio del Toro. *The Last Jedi* follows Rey as she seeks the aid of Luke Skywalker in hopes of turning the tide for the Resistance in the fight against Kylo Ren and the First Order while General Leia Organa, Finn, and Poe Dameron attempt to escape a First Order attack on the dwindling Resistance fleet. The film features the first posthumous film performance by Fisher, who died in December 2016, and the film is dedicated to her memory.[4]\n\n\n*The Last Jedi* is part of a new trilogy of films announced after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Ram Bergman and executive produced by *The Force Awakens* director J. J. Abrams. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. A number of scenes were filmed at Skellig Michael in Ireland during pre-production in September 2015, but principal photography began at Pinewood Studios in England in February 2016 and wrapped that July.\n\n\n*The Last Jedi* premiered in Los Angeles on December 9, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 15. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2017 and the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time by the time its theatrical run was over. It is also the second-highest-grossing *Star Wars* film and turned a net profit of over $417 million. The film was well received by critics and received four nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, including Best Original Score and Best Visual Effects, as well as two nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards. A sequel, *The Rise of Skywalker*, concluded the sequel trilogy in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the battle of Starkiller Base,[a] General Leia Organa is leading the Resistance forces in evacuating their base when the First Order fleet arrives. Against Leia's orders, Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. Kylo Ren hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into space but survives by using the Force. While Leia recovers, Vice-Admiral Holdo assumes command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order.\n\n\nOn Ahch-To, Rey attempts to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the Jedi should end. After encouragement from R2-D2, he agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey, lured by the dark side, searches for answers about her parents and begins communicating with Kylo through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power. Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Snoke was corrupting him, which prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library but hesitates. The spirit of Luke's master Yoda appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of lightning. He encourages Luke to learn from his failure.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose, and BB-8 with a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. Maz Kanata directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet the hacker DJ. Pursued by the local security, they escape Canto Bight with the help of stablehand children and racing animals they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship but are captured by Captain Phasma. Rey also infiltrates the flagship and is captured by Kylo, who brings her before Snoke. Snoke reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts.\n\n\nHoldo plans to evacuate the remaining members of the Resistance using small transport vessels. Believing her plan cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. A recovered Leia stuns Poe with a blaster and proceeds with the evacuation. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux, and the First Order fleet begins firing on the evacuation transports, destroying many.\n\n\nOrdered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the dark side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she battles him for control of Luke's lightsaber, bisecting the weapon. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet with the debris field. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away in the *Millennium Falcon*, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon.\n\n\nLuke appears and confronts the First Order, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the *Falcon*. Exhausted, Luke dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again.\n\n\nAt Canto Bight, the stablehands recount the story of Luke Skywalker; afterward, one of them moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars characters and Lists of Star Wars cast members\n\n* Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, a powerful Jedi Master who has been in self-imposed exile on the planet Ahch-To[5][6]\n* Hamill voices Dobbu Scay, named after the film's editor, Bob Ducsay.

J. Abrams was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, in January 2013.[25] In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, *Episode VIII*, and to write a treatment for the third film, *Episode IX*, with Ram Bergman producing both films.[26][27] Johnson confirmed in August that he would direct *Episode VIII*.[28]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that *Episode VIII* would be released in 2017.[29] In December, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said that the film had not been mapped out and that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson, who would in turn work with (then) *Episode IX* director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.[30] Additionally, Abrams served as an executive producer along with Tom Karnowski and Jason McGatlin.[16] In January 2017, Lucasfilm announced the title for *Episode VIII* as *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*.[31]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nThe *Last Jedi* story begins immediately after *The Force Awakens*.[32] Johnson had his story group watch films such as *Twelve O'Clock High* (1949), *The Bridge on the River Kwai* (1957), *Gunga Din* (1939), *Three Outlaw Samurai* (1964), *Sahara* (1943), and *Letter Never Sent* (1960) for inspiration while developing ideas.[32][33] He felt it was difficult to work on the film while *The Force Awakens* was being finished.[32]\n\n\nJohnson wrote the scene with the mirrored versions of Rey to symbolise her search for identity; when she asks for a vision of her parents, she sees only herself.[34] Rey learns that her parents were \"nobodies\" because it would be \"the hardest thing\" she and the audience could hear; Johnson likened the scene to Luke Skywalker learning that Darth Vader is his father in *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980).[34] During production, Hamill expressed disagreement with the direction of his character, Luke, feeling his disillusioned state was at odds with the character.[35] Hamill later said he regretted making his initial misgivings public and compared his disagreements to his clashes with George Lucas during the filming of *Return of the Jedi* (1983).[35]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2015, Disney shortlisted the female cast members to Gina Rodriguez, Tatiana Maslany, and Olivia Cooke.[36] That same month, Benicio del Toro confirmed his involvement in the film, but denied that he was playing a villain,[37][38] and Mark Hamill was also confirmed.[5] Joaquin Phoenix was also courted to portray the role of DJ, but would end up passing on the offer.[39] In October 2015, Gugu Mbatha-Raw was rumored to have been cast in the film.[40] In November, Kennedy announced at the London premiere of *The Force Awakens* that the entire cast would return for *Episode VIII*, along with \"a handful\" of new cast members.[6] In February 2016, at the start of filming, it was confirmed that Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in undisclosed roles.[14] In April 2017, at the *Star Wars* Celebration Orlando, Lucasfilm announced that Tran would play Resistance maintenance worker Rose Tico, which Johnson described as the film's largest new role.[11][12] To keep Frank Oz's return as Yoda a secret, producers excluded Oz's name in the billing for the film's pre-release marketing and ensured that Oz stayed on set during filming.[15]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSome filming locations: The island of Skellig Michael in Ireland (top), Salar de Uyuni, a salt flat in Bolivia (middle), and the city of Dubrovnik, in Croatia (bottom)\n\nSecond unit photography began during pre-production at Skellig Michael in Ireland on September 14, 2015, due to the difficulties of filming at that location during other seasons.[41] It would have lasted five days, but filming was canceled for the first day due to poor weather and rough conditions.[41][42] In September 2015, del Toro revealed that principal photography would begin in March 2016.[37] The production began work on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios on November 15, 2015.[43] Rick Heinrichs served as production designer.[44]\n\n\nIn January 2016, production of *Episode VIII* was delayed until February due to script rewrites.[45] Filming was in danger of being delayed further due to an upcoming strike between the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television and the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union.[46] On February 10, 2016, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that principal photography had begun[47] under the working title *Space Bear*.[32] Additional filming took place in Dubrovnik, Croatia from March 9 to 16,[48][49] as well as in Ireland in May.[50] Malin Head in County Donegal and a mountain headland, Ceann Sibeal in County Kerry, served as additional filming locations.[51] To increase the scenes' intimacy Driver and Ridley were both present when filming Kylo and Rey's Force visions.[52] Location filming for the battle scenes on the planet Crait took place at the Salar de Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia.[53] Additional filming took place in Mexico.[54]\n\n\nPrincipal photography wrapped on July 22, 2016,[55] though as of early September, Nyong'o had not filmed her scenes.[56] In February 2017, it was announced that sequences from the film were shot in IMAX.[57] Production designer Rick Heinrichs said the original script called for 160 sets, double what might be expected, but that Johnson did some \"trimming and cutting\". Ultimately, 125 sets were created on 14 sound stages at Pinewood Studios.[58]\n\n\nAccording to creature designer Neal Scanlan, *The Last Jedi* has more practical effects than any *Star Wars* film, with 180 to 200 creatures created with practical effects, some cut from the final edit.[59] For Yoda's appearance in the film as a Force ghost, the character was created using puppetry, as was done in the original *Star Wars* trilogy (as opposed to computer-generated imagery, which was used to create Yoda in most of the prequel trilogy).[60] Rian Johnson explained the decision was because he felt a digital Yoda would not have been true to how Luke knew him in *The Empire Strikes Back*.[61]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: The Last Jedi (soundtrack)\n\nIn July 2013, Kennedy confirmed at the *Star Wars* Celebration Europe that John Williams would return to score the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy.[62][63] Williams confirmed his assignment for *The Last Jedi* at a Tanglewood concert in August 2016,[64] stating he would begin recording the score \"off and on\" in December 2016 until March or April 2017.[65] On February 21, 2017, it was confirmed that recording was underway, with both Williams and William Ross conducting the sessions.[66][16] In lieu of a traditional spotting session with Johnson, Williams was provided a temp track of music from his previous film scores as a reference for scoring *The Last Jedi*.[67] The official soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on December 15, 2017.[68]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The advertisement of the film (left) at the Sudirman railway station in Jakarta, Indonesia\nOn September 19, 2017, Australia Post released a set of stamp packs.[69] On October 12, Royal Mail released a set of eight promotional postage stamps designed by Malcolm Tween.[70] Several tie-in books were released on the same day as the film's release, including *The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary*, and various children's reading and activity books.[71] Related novelizations included the prequel book *Cobalt Squadron*, and *Canto Bight*, a collection of novellas about the Canto Bight Casino.[71] As with *The Force Awakens*, there is no official tie-in game for *The Last Jedi*, in favor of integrating content from the film into other *Star Wars* video games,[72] including *Star Wars Battlefront II*, which introduced various content from the film, during the game's first \"season\".[73]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on December 9, 2017,[74] and was released in the United States on December 15,[75] in IMAX and 3D.[76][77] The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 26;[78] however, it was pushed back to December to avoid competition with *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales* (2017).[75]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* digitally in HD and 4K via digital download and Movies Anywhere on March 13, 2018, with an Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD physical release on March 27.[79] On March 31, 2020, a 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set was released, containing all nine films in the series, with each film receiving three discs, a Blu-ray version, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and special features found on the 2011 release for the first six episodic films.[80]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars: The Last Jedi* grossed $620.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $712.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.333 billion.[3] It was the highest-grossing film of 2017 and the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time.[81][82] The film had a worldwide opening of $450.8 million, the eighth-biggest of all time, including $40.6 million that was attributed to IMAX screenings, the second biggest for IMAX.[83][84] It was estimated that the film would need to gross $800 million worldwide to break even;[85] On December 31, 2017, the film crossed the $1 billion mark,[86] making it the third *Star Wars* film to do so. *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $417.5 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs;

It was the largest second-weekend drop of the series, although it remained atop the box office.[93] It made $52.4 million in its third weekend, again topping the box office. It also brought its domestic total to $517.1 million, overtaking the Disney film *Beauty and the Beast* (2017) as the highest of 2017.[94] It grossed $23.6 million and was surpassed the following weekend by *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017) (which was in its third week) and *Insidious: The Last Key* (2018).[95]\n\n\n\n#### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn its first two days of release the film made $60.8 million from 48 markets. The top countries were the United Kingdom ($10.2 million), Germany ($6.1 million), France ($6 million), Australia ($5.6 million), and Brazil ($2.5 million).[96] By the end of the weekend, the film made $230 million outside the United States and Canada.

The website's consensus reads: \"*Star Wars: The Last Jedi* honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists—and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\"[103] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[104] Metacritic analysis found the film was the 25th-most mentioned film on \"best of the year\" film rankings[105] and the 22nd-most mentioned on \"best of the decade\" film rankings.[106]\n\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz of *RogerEbert.com* gave the film four stars out of four, praising the surprises and risks that it took, writing that \"The movie works equally well as an earnest adventure full of passionate heroes and villains and a meditation on sequels and franchise properties\", in which the film \"includes multiple debates over whether one should replicate or reject the stories and symbols of the past.\"[107] Writing for *Rolling Stone*, Peter Travers gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising Johnson's direction and the cast performances, particularly Hamill's, and concluding that the film \"ranks with the very best Star Wars epics (even the pinnacle that is *The Empire Strikes Back*)\".[108] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the action sequences and humor, and said that the film \"doesn't pack quite the same emotional punch [as *The Force Awakens*] and it lags a bit in the second half, [but] this is still a worthy chapter in the *Star Wars* franchise\", containing a few callbacks of \"previous characters and iconic moments\".[109]\n\n\nWill Gompertz, arts editor of BBC News, gave the film four stars out of five, writing \"Rian Johnson [...] has not ruined your Christmas with a turkey. His gift to you is a cracker, a blockbuster movie packed with invention, wit, and action galore.\"[110] The unpredictability of the plot was appreciated by reviewers such as Alex Leadbeater of *Screen Rant*, who commented specifically that the death of Snoke was \"the best movie twist in years\".[111] Creator of the franchise George Lucas, who was not involved with the film's production, described *The Last Jedi* as \"beautifully made\" shortly after its release.[112][113] His reaction to *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* was generally more negative.[114][115]\n\n\nConversely, Richard Brody of *The New Yorker* wrote that the film \"comes off as a work that's ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified\".[116] Kate Taylor of *The Globe and Mail* gave the film two stars out of four, saying it suffered from too many new additions and adding, \"as it seeks to uphold a giant cultural legacy, this unfolding trilogy struggles to maintain a balance that often seems just out of reach.\"[117] Owen Gleiberman of *Variety* criticized the film for being too derivative of the past films, noting \"it's now repeating things that have already been repeated\", becoming \"an official monument to nostalgia\".[118]\n\n\n\n### Audience reception[edit]\n\n\nAudience reception measured by scientific polling methods was highly positive.[119] Audiences polled by CinemaScore during the opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 89% overall positive score, a 79% \"definite recommend\", and a rare five-star rating.[89] SurveyMonkey determined that 89% of its polled audience graded the film positively.[120]\n\n\nUser-generated scores at Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic received considerable coverage for being more negative. Audience scores on such sites require only registration and do not ensure that contributing voters have seen the film.[121] Several reviewers speculated that coordinated vote brigading from internet groups and bots contributed to the low scores,[122][123] including analysis provided by *Quartz* and Bleeding Cool.[124][125] After initially rejecting tampering claims,[126] Rotten Tomatoes later said in 2019 that *The Last Jedi* had been \"seriously targeted\" by a review-bombing campaign.[127] Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* labeled the negative reaction \"alleged\", saying it was based on \"easily trolled online user polls\", and he criticized Disney for placating the \"vocal minority\" in its approach to the sequel, *The Rise of Skywalker*.[128]\n\n\n*The Last Jedi* was also characterized by reviewers as divisive among audiences.[129] Emily VanDerWerff of *Vox* found that dissatisfied fans saw the film as too progressive, disliked its humor, plot, or character arcs, or felt betrayed that it ignored fan theories.[122] Other reviewers made similar observations.[130] Particularly divisive was the reveal that Rey's parents are insignificant;[131] many fans had expected her to be Luke's daughter or to share a lineage with another character from the original trilogy.[132] There was also sentiment that Snoke's character was underdeveloped and that Luke's actions contradicted his previous heroic portrayal.[133] Reviewers claimed that fan theories were held so strongly among some viewers that it was difficult for them to accept different stories,[134] but they noted that other viewers appreciated the film's action, tone, and deviation from *Star Wars* tradition.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Harassment[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kelly Marie Tran § Personal life\n\nThe casting of Asian-American actress Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico spurred both a racial and misogynistic backlash against the film, including sexist and racist commentary about both Tran and her character.[137] Tran was accused of representing \"forced diversity\" imposed by \"social justice warriors\" because of her race.[138] After facing extensive harassment over her ethnicity and appearance, Tran quit social media.[138][139] The incident highlighted the challenges faced by people of color who are in *Star Wars*.[140] Tran was the first woman of color to have a lead role in a *Star Wars* film, and similarly John Boyega faced the same type of abuse when he was cast in *The Force Awakens*.[140][141] After leaving social media, director Rian Johnson and co-stars Mark Hamill and John Boyega defended Tran against the harassment she received.[141]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n |

Abrams. Produced by Lucasfilm and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the third installment of the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy, following *The Force Awakens* (2015) and *The Last Jedi* (2017), and the final episode of the nine-part \"Skywalker saga\".[a] Its ensemble cast includes Carrie Fisher,[b] Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams. Set one year after *The Last Jedi*, *The Rise of Skywalker* follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron as they lead the Resistance's final stand against Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and the First Order, who are aided by the return of the Galactic Emperor, Palpatine.\n\n\nFollowing initial reports that *The Last Jedi* director Rian Johnson would write the script for *Episode IX*, in August 2015, Colin Trevorrow was hired to direct and to write a script with his collaborator Derek Connolly; both ultimately retain story credit with Abrams and Chris Terrio. In September 2017, Trevorrow left the project following creative differences with producer Kathleen Kennedy, and Abrams returned as director. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score—his final score for the franchise.[6] Principal photography began in August 2018 at Pinewood Studios in England and wrapped in February 2019, with post-production completed in November 2019. With a budget of $416 million, it is the third most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n*The Rise of Skywalker* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 16, 2019, and was released in the United States on December 20. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $1.077 billion worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2019; although it was the lowest-grossing installment of the trilogy, it turned an estimated net profit of $300 million (with an assumed production budget of $275 million; the true $416 million budget would decrease profits to $150 million).[7] It received three nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards (Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing) as well as three at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards (also Best Special Visual Effects, Best Original Music, and Best Sound). It won five awards at the 46th Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nFollowing a threat of revenge by the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, Kylo Ren obtains a Sith wayfinder that leads to the planet Exegol. There, he finds Palpatine, who reveals himself as the power behind Snoke and the First Order. Palpatine unveils the Final Order—a massive armada of Sith Star Destroyers—and orders Kylo to find and kill Rey, who is continuing her Jedi training under Resistance leader Leia Organa. Poe Dameron and Finn deliver intelligence from a spy in the First Order that Palpatine is on Exegol; Rey reads in Luke Skywalker's notes that a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO depart in the *Millennium Falcon* to Pasaana, where a clue to a wayfinder is hidden.\n\n\nKylo initiates a Force bond with Rey to discover her location. He travels to Pasaana with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. With Lando Calrissian's help, Rey and her friends find the clue—a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from interpreting—and the remains of a Sith assassin named Ochi and his ship. Rey senses Kylo nearby, and faces him. The First Order capture the *Falcon*, Chewbacca, and the dagger. Attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. Believing Chewbacca is dead, the group escape on Ochi's ship.\n\n\nThey travel to Kijimi, where the droidsmith Babu Frik extracts the Sith text from C-3PO's memory, revealing coordinates to a wayfinder. Rey senses Chewbacca is alive aboard a First Order Star Destroyer. With the smuggler Zorii's help, the group mount a rescue mission. Rey recovers the dagger and duels Kylo, who informs her that she is Palpatine's paternal granddaughter. Palpatine had ordered Ochi to find the young Rey, but her parents hid her on Jakku; Ochi subsequently killed Rey's parents. To spite Kylo, General Hux saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself as the spy. Rey and her friends escape, while Hux is executed by General Pryde. The group fly the *Falcon* to the wayfinder's coordinates on a moon in the Endor system.\n\n\nThere, they find renegade stormtroopers led by Jannah, whom they recruit to the Resistance. Rey retrieves the wayfinder from the wreckage of the second Death Star, but she is met by Kylo, who destroys the wayfinder and duels her. In a dying act, Leia calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as Rey impales him. Sensing Leia's death, Rey is overcome by guilt. She heals Kylo and takes his TIE fighter to exile herself on Ahch-To. Meanwhile, Kylo converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo. He throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. Sensing Leia's death and Ben's return, Palpatine sends a Star Destroyer to destroy Kijimi as a show of force to draw Rey out. On Ahch-To, Luke's Force spirit encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey leaves for Exegol in Luke's X-wing fighter, using the wayfinder from Kylo's ship.\n\n\nRey transmits her coordinates to R2-D2, allowing the Resistance, now led by Poe and Finn, to follow her to Exegol. There, she confronts Palpatine. Debilitated, he demands that she kill him, in anger, so his spirit can possess her body. The Resistance launch an attack on the Sith fleet and Lando arrives with reinforcements from across the galaxy, including Zorii and Babu. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey. Palpatine senses their power as \"a dyad in the Force\" and drains it to rejuvenate his body. He incapacitates Ben and attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning. Weakened, Rey hears the voices of past Jedi, who give her strength. Palpatine attacks her with lightning, but Rey deflects it using Luke and Leia's lightsabers, killing Palpatine before dying herself. Ben uses the Force to revive Rey, sacrificing himself, and they kiss before he dies. The Resistance destroys the remaining Sith forces, while people across the galaxy rise up against the First Order.\n\n\nThe Resistance celebrate their victory. Rey visits Luke's abandoned homestead on Tatooine and buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers. A passerby asks her name; seeing Luke and Leia's Force spirits nearby, she responds, \"Rey Skywalker\".\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n* Carrie Fisher[5] as Leia Organa, the Force-sensitive leading general of the Resistance, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren's mother, Luke Skywalker's twin sister, and the daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala.

J. Abrams returned to direct the final film.\nIn January 2016, Trevorrow revealed he was considering shooting on film and that he had wanted to shoot \"on location\" in outer space with IMAX cameras.[51] Trevorrow collaborated closely with Johnson whilst developing his script and even requested a scene featuring Rey and Poe be shot for *The Last Jedi*.[52][53][54] After the success of *The Force Awakens*, the highest-grossing film of 2015, *Episode IX* was put into production in February 2016, which Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger vaguely reported.[55][56] Carrie Fisher died in December 2016.[57] Prior to the release of the film, Carrie Fisher's brother Todd Fisher, who planned her character General Leia Organa to appear in the film before her death, revealed that \"she was going to be the big payoff in the final film\" and \"she was going to be the last Jedi, so to speak.\"[58]\n\n\nIn late April 2017, Disney announced that the film would be released on May 24, 2019.[59] A month later, filming was expected to begin in January 2018.[60] In August 2017, it was announced that Jack Thorne would rewrite the script.[61] On September 5, 2017, Lucasfilm stated that Trevorrow had left the production following creative differences.[62] Trevorrow's place as director was supposedly on ice since June 2017.[63] *The Hollywood Reporter* reported that his working relationship with Kathleen Kennedy had become unmanageable after failing to deliver a satisfactory script, despite writing several drafts, nor were either happy with Thorne's revisions.[64][65] Johnson was rumored as the top choice to replace Trevorrow as director,[66] but stated \"it was never in the plan for me to direct *Episode IX*.\"[67] David Fincher had discussions with the studio but would ultimately decline from directing the film.[68][69]\n\n\nThe next day, it was announced that J.J. Abrams, the director of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, would return to direct the film,[70] and that the film's release date would be moved to December 20, 2019.[59] The story team met with George Lucas before writing the new script to discuss the nature of the Force.[71] Abrams co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio,[72] though Trevorrow and Connolly retain story credits.[73][74] The story was rewritten to some extent before filming was completed.[75] Terrio had written off working on larger-scale films at the time and did not socially know Abrams prior to agreeing to co-write the film with him.[76][77] The film was produced by Abrams' company Bad Robot Productions, Kathleen Kennedy, and Michelle Rejwan.[72] According to Terrio, the film's script had to include certain narrative beats provided by Kennedy and Rejwan, including the redemption of the character Kylo Ren.[78] Abrams had also consulted with Johnson on making a film that both stood on its own but built upon previously established ideas and story elements.[79][80] Until its official reveal, only Abrams knew the title of the film.[81]\n\n\nBefore filming, *Episode IX* was initially given the working title *Black Diamond*, which was then changed to *TrIXie* in 2018,[82] so that the roman numeral \"IX\" would be included in the working title.[83] The film's title, *The Rise of Skywalker*, was announced at April 2019's *Star Wars* Celebration in Chicago.[84]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nCarrie Fisher, who played Leia Organa, died on December 27, 2016.[57] *Variety* and Reuters reported that she had been planned for a key role in *Episode IX*.[85] In January 2017, Lucasfilm stated that there were no plans to digitally generate Fisher's performance as they had for *Rogue One* (2016).[86] The following April, Fisher's brother Todd revealed that Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, had granted Disney the rights to use recent footage of Fisher.[87] However, a week later, Kathleen Kennedy stated that Fisher would not appear in the film.[88][89] In July 2018, J. J. Abrams announced that unused footage of Fisher from *The Force Awakens* would be used to help complete the story.[8][9][90][e] In flashback scenes, digital de-aging was used for the appearance of Luke and Leia through the use of facial shots of both characters from the *Empire Strikes Back*, and *Return of the Jedi* respectively.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBilly Dee Williams (left) and Ian McDiarmid (right) returned as Lando Calrissian and Emperor Palpatine, on-screen for the first time since *Return of the Jedi* (1983) and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005), respectively.[24][92]\n\nIn July 2018, Keri Russell was in talks to play a part with some \"action-heavy fight scenes\",[93] and it was confirmed that Billy Dee Williams would return as Lando Calrissian,[94] onscreen for the first time since 1983's *Return of the Jedi* — marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.[92][f] At the end of July, Russell was confirmed to have been cast,[95] and there was an announcement of returning and additional new cast members.[5] In late August, *Deadline Hollywood* announced that Dominic Monaghan and Matt Smith had been cast in unspecified roles;[96][97] in 2019, Smith denied his involvement,[98][g] but he later clarified that he had been in talks for an unrealized \"transformative\" part.[101] Early rumors from *Making Star Wars* claimed Smith was set to portray a \"dark side acolyte\" who gets possessed by Palpatine.[102][103] Greg Grunberg reprises his role as Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley.[29]\n\n\nAt Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, it was revealed via the film's teaser trailer that Ian McDiarmid would return to portray Palpatine.[24] Since the event was held after principal photography wrapped, Abrams was thrilled that news of McDiarmid on the set never leaked.[24] Kathleen Kennedy said they decided to reveal Palpatine's return ahead of the film's release because of the characters playing a larger role in the story, having them differentiated from Grogu, the character from *The Mandalorian*.[104] Abrams had initially considered Palpatine returning while developing *The Force Awakens*.[105][106]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wadi Rum in Jordan served as the location for the desert planet Pasaana.\nPrincipal photography began on August 1, 2018, at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[5] Filming also took place in Wadi Rum, Jordan.[107] Oscar Isaac stated that Abrams was allowing more improvised acting than in the previous two films.[108] Due to the tight schedule, some editing took place on set.[109] The crew on *The Rise of Skywalker* had three fewer months than they had to work on *The Force Awakens* leading to Maryann Brandon being sent in to cut on set a third of the way through production.[110] Scenes detailing Palpatine's return were altered and changed during production as they were felt to \"go off topic\".[111] The kiss between Rey and Ben was initially going to be excluded from the film, until Abrams decided against it at the last minute.[112] Principal photography wrapped on February 15, 2019.[113] Footage from the film was shown at The Walt Disney Company's annual shareholders meeting on March 7, 2019.[114] Two weeks of reshoots took place at Pinewood involving Hamill, Ridley, and Isaac in July 2019.[115] Another round of reshoots took place at Bad Robot Productions between late September and mid-October.[116] Abrams stated that the film had fewer reshoots and story adjustments than *Episode VII*.[117]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nThe visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic and supervised by Roger Guyett.[118] Last minute ADR was recorded with Adam Driver, in which he recorded his lines in a closet.[119] The film finished post-production on November 25, 2019. After John Boyega accidentally left a copy of the script in his hotel room, it was listed on eBay for around £65. A Disney employee identified the script as authentic and purchased it from the seller for an undisclosed sum.[120][121][122]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (soundtrack)\n\nIn January 2018, it was confirmed that John Williams would return to compose and conduct *The Rise of Skywalker*.[123][124] The next month, Williams announced that it would be the last *Star Wars* film for which he would compose the score[6] (though he would later return to compose the theme music for the Disney+ miniseries *Obi-Wan Kenobi*). In August 2019, it was revealed that Williams had written about 35 of an expected 135 minutes of music for the film, which according to Williams' brother Don, would incorporate all of the major themes of the Skywalker saga.[125] Scoring began in July 2019 with Williams and William Ross conducting and orchestrating the sessions over the course of six months.[126] The official soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on December 20, 2019.[127]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nDespite staying silent about many details of the film, Abrams expressed his hopes that fans and general audiences would be \"satisfied\".[128] He headed a panel dedicated to the film on April 12, 2019, during *Star Wars* Celebration in Chicago,[129] where the film's title was revealed.[84]\n\n\nAdditionally, the story events of the Disneyland themed area *Star Wars*: Galaxy's Edge precede the film, including the *Millennium Falcon*: Smugglers Run motion simulator, which features Chewbacca.[130] On August 24, a new poster and \"sizzle reel\" was released at D23;[23] the latter was released to the public two days later. The footage includes a montage of the Skywalker saga so far, as well as several new shots from the film.[131]\n\n\n\n### Tie-in literature and merchandise[edit]\n\n\nA publishing campaign titled \"Journey to *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*\" was announced on May 4, 2019. It includes the novel *Resistance Reborn*, set between *The Last Jedi* and *The Rise of Skywalker*, the young-adult novel *Force Collector*, the Middle Grade novel *Spark of the Resistance,* and various other titles.[132] From December 18, 2019, to March 11, 2020, a prequel graphic novel titled *The Rise of Kylo Ren*, telling the story of how Ben Solo became Kylo Ren and elaborating upon the character's backstory, was published by Marvel Comics, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Will Sliney.[133]\n\n\nThe official novelization of *The Rise of Skywalker* is by Rae Carson; hardcover and audiobook versions were released on March 19, 2020. The novel details Palpatine's return in more depth: He transferred his consciousness into a clone body following his death in *Return of the Jedi*, and his \"son\", Rey's father, was a failed clone of Palpatine.[134][135] The junior novel and corresponding audiobook are by Michael Kogge and was released on April 21, 2020. A five-issue Marvel Comics adaptation written by Jody Houser and illustrated by Will Sliney was planned to debut in mid-2020,[136][137] but this was later cancelled, making the film the first in the franchise not to receive a serialized comic adaptation.[138] A separate graphic novel adaptation was released by IDW Publishing in 2021.[139]\n\n\nA story arc of 2020's *Darth Vader* comic ties into *The Rise of Skywalker*, utilizing a creature cut from the film as well as Ochi.[140] Further, a novel titled *Shadow of the Sith*, released mid-2022, explores the backstory of Luke and Lando as they investigate the dead world of Exegol.[141]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nThe video game *Star Wars Battlefront II* (2017) released a free level set on Ajan Kloss.[142] In December 2019, the video game *Fortnite Battle Royale* released several cosmetics featuring character outfits for Rey, Finn, a Sith Trooper, Kylo Ren, and Zorii Bliss along with a TIE Fighter glider, a *Millennium Falcon* glider (which was given to players for free from the Winterfest Event), four emotes, and two free banners.[143] On December 14, *Fortnite*'s publisher Epic Games released a preview of the film on an in-game theater screen as a live event.[144] At the end of the event, a message from Palpatine (the one mentioned in the film's opening crawl) was heard.[145] To coincide with the release of the film, a trailer for the forthcoming video game, *Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga* was released on the same day.[146]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe film was originally planned to be released in the United States on May 24, 2019,[59] before being pushed back to December 20.[147] It had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 16.[148] Unlike most studio films, Disney reportedly did not hold test screenings for *The Rise of Skywalker*, instead only showing it to Abrams' friends and family, as well as a terminally-ill fan.[149][150] Before the film's release, Disney issued a warning that the scenes with strobe-like flashing lights may trigger photosensitive migraines and seizures.[151]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*The Rise of Skywalker* was scheduled to be released on Digital HD on March 17, 2020, but was released four days early in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[152] Its DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD release followed on March 31 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.[153] The 4K version of the film was also released in \"The Skywalker Saga\" Ultra HD Blu-ray box set that same date.[154] It was released on Disney+ on May 4, which is reportedly two months ahead of its previously scheduled release date.[155]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*The Rise of Skywalker* grossed $515.2 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $561.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.077 billion,[3] making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2019.[156] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the net profit of the film to be $300 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[7]\n\n\nPre-sale tickets went on sale on October 21, 2019, and the film sold more tickets in their first hour of availability on Atom Tickets than the previous record-holder for ticket sales, *Avengers: Endgame* (2019). It became Atom Tickets' second-best first-day seller of all time behind *Endgame*, selling more than twice the number of tickets as *The Last Jedi* sold in that same timeframe, while Fandango reported it outsold all previous *Star Wars* films.[157][158] Box office tracking had *The Rise of Skywalker* grossing around $205 million in its opening weekend, though some firms predicted a debut closer to $175 million.[159] The film made $89.6 million on its first day, including $40 million from Thursday night previews, the sixth-highest opening day of all time.[160][161] It went on to debut to $177.4 million, which was the third-highest opening ever for a December release and the 12th-best of all time, and it was also noted that Saturday (which saw a 47% drop from Friday's gross) was the busiest shopping day of the year, likely affecting ticket sales.[162][163][164] However, *Deadline Hollywood* did write that \"we can't ignore the less than platinum B+\" audience exit scores, which could affect the film's legs (box office longevity) moving forward.[162] The film made $32 million on Christmas Day, the second-best total ever for the holiday after *The Force Awakens*' $49.3 million in 2015.[165] It went on to have a five-day total of $138.8 million, including $76 million for the weekend.[166] In its third weekend the film made $34.5 million, remaining in first,[167][168] before being dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *1917* (2019).[169] On January 14, 2020, the film crossed the $1 billion mark at the box office, becoming Disney's seventh film of 2019 to do so.[170] At the end of its box office run, it was third highest-grossing film of 2019 in this region behind *Avengers: Endgame* and *The Lion King*.[171]\n\n\nWorldwide the film was projected to gross around $450 million in its opening weekend, including $250 million from 52 international territories.[172] It made $59.1 million from its first day of international release in 46 countries. The biggest markets were the United Kingdom ($8.3 million), Germany ($7.2 million), France ($5.3 million), and Australia ($4.3 million).[173] In China, the film made $1.6 million (RMB11.6 million) through its first day.[174] It went on to open to $198 million from overseas countries and $373.5 million worldwide, coming in below projections and 47% lower than *The Last Jedi*'s total. Its biggest opening totals remained the UK ($26.8 million), Germany ($21.8 million), France ($15.2 million), Japan ($14.6 million), Australia ($12.6 million), and China ($12.1 million).[173]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains too many and overly lengthy quotations**. Please help summarize the quotations. Consider transferring direct quotations to Wikiquote or excerpts to Wikisource. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 51% with an average score of 6.1/10, based on 527 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*The Rise of Skywalker* suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination, but concludes this beloved saga with fan-focused devotion.\"[175] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100 based on 61 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[176]\n\n\nRichard Roeper, reviewing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film three stars out of four, writing that it \"rarely comes close to touching greatness, but it's a solid, visually dazzling and warmhearted victory [for] quality filmmaking.\"[177] *The A.V. Club*'s A. A. Dowd gave the film a C+, stating that the film \"is so freighted with obligation that it almost groans under the weight, flashing a weak smile as it vaguely approximates the appearance of a zippy good time.\"[178] Michael Phillips for *Chicago Tribune* wrote that the film \"does the job. It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident, soothingly predictable way, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid [upsetting the] tradition-minded quadrants of the *Star Wars* fan base.\"[179]\n\n\nMick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* described the film as \"a disappointment\" and wrote, \"For all the movie's faults, it's likely that most people will consider *The Rise of Skywalker* and accept the trade: Sit through a so-so 110 minutes to get to a strong half hour.\"[180] Owen Gleiberman of *Variety* called the film \"the most elegant, emotionally rounded, and gratifying *Star Wars* adventure since the glory days of *Star Wars* (1977) and *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) ... but given the last eight films, the bar isn't that high.\"[181] The BBC's Nicholas Barber praised the film's acting and wrote, \"*The Rise of Skywalker* has been lovingly crafted by a host of talented people, and yet the best they can do is pay tribute to everything [George Lucas] did several decades ago.\"[182]\n\n\nScott Mendelson for *Forbes* described the film as \"possibly worse\" compared to the previous Skywalker saga films while ending the main saga and \"denying this new trilogy its artistic reason for existence\". He also criticized the film for retconning *The Last Jedi* and for its conventional plot twists, writing that the film is full of \"patronizing reversals in the name of mollifying the fans who merely want to be reminded of the first three movies.\"[183] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* described the film as \"a *Last Jedi* corrective\", which is \"the more accurate way to describe it\" and represents \"an epic failure of nerve\". He further wrote it \"feels more like a retreat, a return to a zone of emotional and thematic safety from a filmmaker with a gift for packaging nostalgia as subversion.\"[184] Writing for *The New Yorker*, Richard Brody wrote that the film's faults \"are those of the franchise over all\", as the film's director \"J. J. Abrams is mainly a distiller and a magnifier and brings virtually no originality to it\". Brody said that it would have been better if a \"boldly imaginative vulgarian such as Michael Bay\" had instead created a \"derisive wreckage\" of Star Wars.[185] Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com* criticized the film, giving it 2.5/5 stars, faulting it for \"Terrible dialogue, disinterested performances, and an unconvincing, phony CGI aesthetic\", and criticizing it for its \"misdirection\" and calling it \"A movie that so desperately wants to please a fractured fanbase that it doesn't bother with an identity of its own\", though he praised it for its \"[r]emarkable set pieces\".[186]\n\n\nWhereas Asian-American actress Kelly Marie Tran had around ten minutes of screen time in *The Last Jedi*, she appears for about a minute in *The Rise of Skywalker.* The reduced role was interpreted by some critics as a concession to fans who disliked her character;[187] Tran had been a target of racist, fatphobic and misogynistic online harassment following the release of *The Last Jedi.* Multiple cast members involved on the previous film defended her, such as Boyega.[188] Critics said she was \"sidelined\" into a minor character, and commented on how she was written out \"without any explanation\" and her minor role was considered by one critic to be \"one of the film's biggest disappointments\".[189][190] With regard to the criticism towards the character's reduced screen-time, screenwriter Chris Terrio said it was due to the difficulty of including the deceased Carrie Fisher archive footage in scenes planned to feature both characters.[191]\n\n\n\n### Audience response[edit]\n\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest among the live-action films in the franchise.[162][192] On PostTrak, audiences gave the film an average of four stars out of five, with 70% of respondents rating it as a \"definite recommend\".[162][193] Of the demographics polled by PostTrak, parents gave it 5 stars and children under 12 years old gave it 4.5 stars, with 80% of males and 84% of females rating it positively. RelishMix, which tracks social media posts and online presence, \"noticed a divided reaction to *Skywalker* online, though it leaned slightly positive\".[162]\n\n\nMonths prior to the film's trailer release, the \"Want to See\" percentage was review bombed on Rotten Tomatoes, dropping the score as low as 5% within a day.[194] Negative comments reflected a \"lingering negativity\" toward *The Last Jedi* according to *Screen Rant*.[194] After a similar bombing campaign occurred with the 2019 film *Captain Marvel*, Rotten Tomatoes temporarily changed the \"Want to See\" feature to a number and eventually removed the feature altogether.[194]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | February 9, 2020 | Best Original Score | John Williams | Nominated\n | [195] |\n| Best Sound Editing | Matthew Wood and David Acord | Nominated\n |\n| Best Visual Effects | Roger Guyett, Neal Scanlan, Patrick Tubach, and Dominic Tuohy | Nominated\n |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | February 1, 2020\n | Excellence in Production Design for a Fantasy Film | Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins\n | Nominated\n | [196] |\n| Artios Awards | January 30, 2020 | The Zeitgeist Award\n | Nina Gold, April Webster, Alyssa Weisberg, and Angela Young\n | Won\n | [197] |\n| British Academy Film Awards | February 2, 2020 | Best Sound | David Acord, Andy Nelson, Christopher Scarabosio, Stuart Wilson, and Matthew Wood | Nominated\n | [198] |\n| Best Original Score | John Williams | Nominated\n |\n| Best Special Visual Effects | Roger Guyett, Paul Kavanagh, Neal Scanlan, and Dominic Tuohy\n | Nominated\n |\n| Costume Designers Guild Awards\n | January 28, 2020 | Excellence in Fantasy Film | Michael Kaplan | Nominated\n | [199] |\n| Dragon Awards | September 6, 2020\n | Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Movie\n | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Won\n | [200] |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | May 29, 2019\n | Best Teaser\n | \"Teaser\" (The Hive)\n | Nominated\n | [201][202] |\n| July 22, 2021\n | Best Fantasy Adventure\n | \"Together\" (The Hive)\n | Nominated\n | [203] |\n| Best Original Score\n | \"Together\" (The Hive)\n | Won\n |\n| Best Fantasy Adventure TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | \"Fate\" (The Hive)\n | Won\n |\n| Best Home Ent Fantasy Adventure\n | \"Target Wall\" (Tiny Hero)\n | Won\n |\n| Best Fantasy Adventure Poster\n | \"IMAX One-Sheet\" (Lindeman & Associates)\n | Won\n |\n| \"Payoff One-Sheet\" (Lindeman & Associates)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best BTS/EPK for a Feature Film (Over 2 Minutes)\n | \"*Star Wars* Culture Featurette\" (The Hive)\n | Won\n |\n| Grammy Awards | March 14, 2021 | Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* – John Williams | Nominated\n | [204] |\n| Hugo Awards | August 1, 2020\n | Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form | Chris Terrio and J.

Ridley is set to reprise her role as Rey.[213] Kennedy also hinted at the possibility of other sequel trilogy characters coming back.[214]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The \"Skywalker saga\" refers to the main *Star Wars* film franchise, which consists of three trilogies.[4]\n2. **^** This is the second posthumous film performance by Fisher, who died in 2016 and appears through the use of unused footage from *The Force Awakens*.[5]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Billie Lourd portrays her mother's character in a short flashback, which also utilizes footage from *Return of the Jedi* (1983).[10][11]\n4. **^** Unseen footage of Fisher from *The Last Jedi* was considered but not used.[12][13]\n5. **^** According to Todd Fisher, \"There's a lot of minutes of footage. I don't mean just outtakes. This is unused, new content that could be woven into the storyline. ... It's going to look like it was meant to be. Like it was shot yesterday.\"[9]\n6. **^** Also tying this record is Denis Lawson as Wedge Antilles, though he only makes a cameo appearance in *The Rise of Skywalker*.\n7. **^** In April 2019, Disney's British website listed Smith as being in the film,[99] but removed his and Monaghan's name the following month.[100]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\".
