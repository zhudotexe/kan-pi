Following the right-hand rule for prograde rotation puts Ishtar Terra in the negative hemisphere and makes the axial tilt 177.36\u00b0.\n |\n\n\n**Venus** is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a \"morning star\" or an \"evening star\". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,[20][21] appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.\n\n\nVenus has a weak induced magnetosphere and an especially thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, which creates, together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover, an extreme greenhouse effect. This results at the surface in a mean temperature of 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid, while at cloudy altitudes of 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) above the surface, the pressure, temperature and also radiation are very much like at Earth's surface. Conditions possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, with recent research having found indicative, but not convincing, evidence of life on the planet. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history, possibly enough to form oceans, but runaway greenhouse effects eventually evaporated any water, which then was taken into space by the solar wind.[22][23][24] Internally, Venus is thought to consist of a core,\u00a0mantle, and\u00a0crust, the latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shaping the surface with large resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System which have no moons.[25] Nonetheless, studies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics during ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\nVenus has a rotation which has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the strong currents and drag of its atmosphere. This rotation produces, together with the time of 224.7 Earth days it takes Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun (a Venusian solar year), a Venusian solar day length of 117 Earth days, resulting in a Venusian year being just under two Venusian days long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. While this allows them to come closer to each other at inferior conjunction than any other pair of Solar System planets, Mercury stays on average closer to them and any other planet, as Mercury is the most central planet and passes by most frequently.[28] That said, Venus and Earth between them have the lowest difference in gravitational potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This has allowed Venus to be the most accessible destination and attractive gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights.\n\n\nIn 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight in human history, followed by many essential interplanetary firsts like the first soft landing on another planet in 1970. These probes made it evident that extreme greenhouse effects have created oppressive surface conditions, an insight that has crucially informed predictions about global warming on Earth.[29][30] This finding stopped most attention towards theories and the then popular science fiction about Venus being a habitable or inhabited planet. Crewed flights to Venus have been suggested nevertheless, either to flyby Venus, performing a gravity assist for reaching Mars faster and safer, or to enter the Venusian atmosphere and stay aloft at altitudes with conditions more comparable to Earth's surface, except atmospheric composition, than anywhere else in the Solar System. Contemporarily, Venus has again gained interest as a case for research into particularly the development of Earth-like planets and their habitability.\n\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Venus to scale among the terrestrial planets of the Solar System, which are arranged by the order of their Inner Solar System orbits outward from the Sun (from left: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars)\nVenus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\".[31] Venus is close to spherical due to its slow rotation.[32] Venus has a diameter of 12,103.6\u00a0km (7,520.8\u00a0mi)\u2014only 638.4\u00a0km (396.7\u00a0mi) less than Earth's\u2014and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[33] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Venus\n\n![The atmosphere of Venus appears darker and lined with shadows. The shadows trace the prevailing wind direction.](image)Cloud structure of the Venusian atmosphere, made visible through ultraviolet imaging\nVenus has a dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen\u2014both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface with a 6.5% density of water\u2014[34] and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide.[35] The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's\u2014a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1\u00a0km (5\u20448\u00a0mi) under Earth's oceans. The density at the surface is 65\u00a0kg/m3 (4.1\u00a0lb/cu\u00a0ft), 6.5% that of water[34] or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293\u00a0K (20\u00a0\u00b0C; 68\u00a0\u00b0F) at sea level. The CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 735\u00a0K (462\u00a0\u00b0C; 864\u00a0\u00b0F).[36][37] This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) and maximum surface temperature of 700\u00a0K (427\u00a0\u00b0C; 801\u00a0\u00b0F),[38][39] even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance. Because of its runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has been identified by scientists such as Carl Sagan as a warning and research object linked to climate change on Earth.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\nVenus Temperature[40]\n| Type | SurfaceTemperature\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Maximum | 900\u00a0\u00b0F (482\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n| Normal | 847\u00a0\u00b0F (453\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n| Minimum | 820\u00a0\u00b0F (438\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n\n\nVenus's atmosphere is rich in primordial noble gases compared to that of Earth.[41] This enrichment indicates an early divergence from Earth in evolution. An unusually large comet impact[42] or accretion of a more massive primary atmosphere from solar nebula[43] have been proposed to explain the enrichment. However, the atmosphere is depleted of radiogenic argon, a proxy for mantle degassing, suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism.[44][45]\n\n\nStudies have suggested that billions of years ago, Venus's atmosphere could have been much more like the one surrounding the early Earth, and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface.[46][47][48] After a period of 600 million to several billion years,[49] solar forcing from rising luminosity of the Sun and possibly large volcanic resurfacing caused the evaporation of the original water and the current atmosphere.[50] A runaway greenhouse effect was created once a critical level of greenhouse gases (including water) was added to its atmosphere.[51] Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earth-like life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of Venus, 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) up from the surface, where the atmospheric conditions are the most Earth-like in the Solar System,[52] with temperatures ranging between 303 and 353\u00a0K (30 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C; 86 and 176\u00a0\u00b0F), and the pressure and radiation being about the same as at Earth's surface, but with acidic clouds and the carbon dioxide air.[53][54][55] The putative detection of an absorption line of phosphine in Venus's atmosphere, with no known pathway for abiotic production, led to speculation in September 2020 that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere.[56][57] Later research attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide,[58] or found that in fact there was no absorption line.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Types of cloud layers, as well as temperature and pressure change by altitude in the atmosphere\nThermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the planet's two hemispheres, those facing and not facing the Sun, despite Venus's slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even without the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen.[61]\n\n\nAbove the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds, consisting mainly of sulfuric acid, which is formed by sulfur dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate. Additionally, the clouds consist of approximately 1% ferric chloride.[62][63] Other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions.[62] These clouds reflect, similar to thick cloud cover on Earth,[64] about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space,[65] and since they cover the whole planet they prevent visual observation of Venus's surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground, with only 10% of the received sunlight reaching the surface,[66] resulting in average daytime levels of illumination at the surface of 14,000 lux, comparable to that on Earth \"in the daytime with overcast clouds\".[67] Strong 300\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.[68] Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10\u201320% rotation speed.[69]\n\n\nThe surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[4][70] Venus's minute axial tilt\u2014less than 3\u00b0, compared to 23\u00b0 on Earth\u2014also minimises seasonal temperature variation.[71] Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian temperatures. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about 655\u00a0K (380\u00a0\u00b0C; 715\u00a0\u00b0F) and an atmospheric pressure of about 4.5\u00a0MPa (45\u00a0bar).[72][73] In 1995, the *Magellan* spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks, a \"Venus snow\" that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena).[74]\n\n\nAlthough Venus has no seasons, in 2019, astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere, possibly caused by opaque, absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds. The variation causes observed changes in the speed of Venus's zonal winds and appears to rise and fall in time with the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.[75]\n\n\nThe existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial[76] since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes.[77][78][79] In 2006\u201307, *Venus Express* clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least half that on Earth,[80] however other instruments have not detected lightning at all.[76] The origin of any lightning remains unclear, but could originate from clouds or Venusian volcanoes.\n\n\nIn 2007, *Venus Express* discovered that a huge double atmospheric polar vortex exists at the south pole.[81][82] *Venus Express* discovered, in 2011, that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of Venus.[83] On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to \"the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\"[84][85]\n\n\nIn December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's *Akatsuki* mission observed bow shaped objects in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system.[86][87][88]\n\n\n\n### Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geology of Venus, Geodynamics of Venus, Mapping of Venus, and Surface features of Venus\n\n![](image)Color-coded elevation map, showing the elevated terrae \"continents\" in yellow and minor features of Venus.\nThe Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. *Venera* landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks.[89] The surface was mapped in detail by *Magellan* in 1990\u201391. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been recent eruptions.[90][91]\n\n\nAbout 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains.[92] Two highland \"continents\" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) above the Venusian average surface elevation.[93] The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek mythological goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.[94]\n\n\nThe absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma. The planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, at 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][96] Venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called \"farra\", which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50\u00a0km (12 to 31\u00a0mi) across, and from 100 to 1,000\u00a0m (330 to 3,280\u00a0ft) high; radial, star-like fracture systems called \"novae\"; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as \"arachnoids\"; and \"coronae\", circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.[97]\n\n\nMost Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women.[98] Exceptions are Maxwell Montes, named after James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Ovda Regio. The last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International Astronomical Union, the body which oversees planetary nomenclature.[99]\n\n\nThe longitude of physical features on Venus is expressed relative to its prime meridian. The original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature Eve, located south of Alpha Regio.[100] After the Venera missions were completed, the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater Ariadne on Sedna Planitia.[101][102]\n\n\nThe stratigraphically oldest tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding basaltic plains measured by *Venus Express* and *Magellan*, indicating a different, possibly a more felsic, mineral assemblage.[23][103] The mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the presence of water ocean and plate tectonics, implying that habitable condition had existed on early Venus with large bodies of water at some point.[104] However, the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain.[105]\n\n\nStudies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest that Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics durng ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)180-degree panorama of Venus's surface from the Soviet *Venera 9* lander, 1975. Black-and-white image of barren, black, slate-like rocks against a flat sky. The ground and the probe are the focus.\n#### Volcanism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanism on Venus\n\n![](image)Radar mosaic of two 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) wide (and less than 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) high) pancake domes in Venus's Eistla region\nMuch of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.[97]:\u200a154 More than 85,000 volcanoes on Venus were identified and mapped.[106][107] This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject to the same erosion process. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years,[108] whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][97]\n\n\nSeveral lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. Sulfur dioxide concentrations in the upper atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold.[109] This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.[110][111] It has been suggested that Venusian lightning (discussed below) could originate from volcanic activity (i.e. volcanic lightning). In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence that suggests that Venus is currently volcanically active, specifically the detection of olivine, a volcanic product that would weather quickly on the planet's surface.[112][113]\n\n\nThis massive volcanic activity is fueled by a superheated interior, which models say could be explained by energetic collisions from when the planet was young. Impacts would have had significantly higher velocity than on Earth, both because Venus' orbit is faster due to its closer proximity to the Sun and because objects would require higher orbital eccentricities to collide with the planet.[114]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by *Venus Express*, in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone Ganis Chasma,[115][note 1] near the shield volcano Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions.[116][117] The actual temperatures are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured, but are likely to have been in the 800\u20131,100\u00a0K (527\u2013827\u00a0\u00b0C; 980\u20131,520\u00a0\u00b0F) range, relative to a normal temperature of 740\u00a0K (467\u00a0\u00b0C; 872\u00a0\u00b0F).[118] In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the *Magellan* orbiter. Using computer simulations, they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Craters[edit]\n\n\n![The plains of Venus](image)Impact craters on the surface of Venus (false-colour image reconstructed from radar data)\nAlmost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event 300\u2013600\u00a0million years ago,[95][96] followed by a decay in volcanism.[120] Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100\u00a0million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.[97]\n\n\nVenusian craters range from 3 to 280\u00a0km (2 to 174\u00a0mi) in diameter. No craters are smaller than 3\u00a0km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.[121] Incoming projectiles less than 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.[122]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![Spherical cross-section of Venus showing the different layers](image)The differentiated structure of Venus\nWithout data from reflection seismology or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus.[123] The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate,[124] although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[125] The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[126] The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900\u20133,450\u00a0km.[125] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500\u00a0km.[127]\n\n\nThe principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.[128] Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.[95]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field and core[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, *Venera 4* found Venus's magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind,[129][130][*page\u00a0needed*] rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against solar and cosmic radiation, reaching at elevations of 54 to 48 km Earth-like levels.[131][132]\n\n\nThe lack of an intrinsic magnetic field on Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size and was expected to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo.[133][134] This implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is reheating the crust.[135]\n\n\nOne possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,[136] or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its core has already been completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.[135]\n\n\nAnother possibility is that the absence of a late, large impact on Venus (*contra* the Earth's \"Moon-forming\" impact) left the core of Venus stratified from the core's incremental formation, and without the forces to initiate/sustain convection, and thus a \"geodynamo\".[137]\n\n\nThe weak magnetosphere around Venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of water molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed.[138] However, the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first 2\u20133 billion years, so the water loss may have occurred more recently.[139] The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.[140]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit of Venus\n\n![Mars circling the Sun further and slower than Earth](image)Venus is the second planet from the Sun, making a full orbit in about 224 days\nVenus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72\u00a0AU (108\u00a0million\u00a0km; 67\u00a0million\u00a0mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.[4] Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting early climate evolution.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Venus and its rotation in respect to its revolution.\nAll planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets rotate on their axes in an anticlockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days\u2014the slowest rotation of any planet. This Venusian sidereal day lasts therefore longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Slowed by its strong atmospheric current the length of the day also fluctuates by up to 20 minutes.[142] Venus's equator rotates at 6.52\u00a0km/h (4.05\u00a0mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4\u00a0km/h (1,040.4\u00a0mph).[note 2][146] Venus's rotation period measured with *Magellan* spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and *Venus Express* visits, with a difference of about 6.5\u00a0minutes.[147] Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days \u2014 the 116-day figure is close to the average number of days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its orbit).[11] One Venusian year is about 1.92\u00a0Venusian solar days.[148] To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east,[148] although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.[149]\n\n\nVenus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.[150][151] The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5\u00a0Venusian solar days (5.001444 to be precise),[152] but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.[153]\n\n\nVenus has no natural satellites.[154] It has several trojan asteroids: the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68[155][156] and two other temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133.[157] In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following 200\u00a0years, but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.[158] About 10\u00a0million\u00a0years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and the resulting Tidal deceleration caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.[159] If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.[154]\n\n\nThe orbital space of Venus has a dust ring-cloud,[160] with a suspected origin either from Venus\u2013trailing asteroids,[161] interplanetary dust migrating in waves, or the remains of the Solar System's original circumstellar disc that formed the planetary system.[162]\n\n\n\n### Orbit in respect to Earth[edit]\n\n\n![A complex, spiral, floral pattern with five loops encircling the middle](image)Earth is positioned at the centre of the diagram, and the curve represents the direction and distance of Venus as a function of time.\nEarth and Venus have a near orbital resonance of 13:8 (Earth orbits eight times for every 13 orbits of Venus).[163]\nTherefore they approach each other and reach inferior conjunction in synodic periods of 584 days, on average.[4] The path that Venus makes in relation to Earth viewed geocentrically draws a pentagram over five synodic periods, shifting every period by 144\u00b0. This pentagram of Venus is sometimes referred to as the petals of Venus due to the path's visual similarity to a flower.[164]\n\n\nWhen Venus lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of 41\u00a0million\u00a0km (25\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[4][note 3][165]\nBecause of the decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year\u00a01 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40\u00a0million\u00a0km (25\u00a0million\u00a0mi); then, there are none for about 60,158 years.[166]\n\n\nWhile Venus approaches Earth the closest, Mercury is more often the closest to Earth of all planets.[167] Venus has the lowest gravitational potential difference to Earth than any other planet, needing the lowest delta-v to transfer between them.[168][169]\n\n\nTidally Venus exerts the third strongest tidal force on Earth, after the Moon and the Sun, though significantly less.[170]\n\n\n\n## Observability[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of the night sky taken from the seashore. A glimmer of sunlight is on the horizon. There are many stars visible. Venus is at the centre, much brighter than any of the stars, and its light can be seen reflected in the ocean.](image)Venus, pictured center-right, is always brighter than all other planets or stars at their maximal brightness, as seen from Earth. Jupiter is visible at the top of the image.\nTo the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).[171] The planet's mean apparent magnitude is \u22124.14 with a standard deviation of 0.31.[18] The brightest magnitude occurs during the crescent phase about one month before or after an inferior conjunction. Venus fades to about magnitude \u22123 when it is backlit by the Sun.[172] The planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight,[173] but is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47\u00b0 of the Sun.[174]\n\n\nVenus \"overtakes\" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun.[4] As it does so, it changes from the \"Evening Star\", visible after sunset, to the \"Morning Star\", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, the other inferior planet, reaches a maximum elongation of only 28\u00b0 and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported \"unidentified flying object\".[175]\n\n\n\n### Phases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phases of Venus\n\n![Diagram illustrating the phases of Venus](image)The phases of Venus and evolution of its apparent diameter\nAs it orbits the Sun, Venus displays phases like those of the Moon in a telescopic view. The planet appears as a small and \"full\" disc when it is on the opposite side of the Sun (at superior conjunction). Venus shows a larger disc and \"quarter phase\" at its maximum elongations from the Sun, and appears at its brightest in the night sky. The planet presents a much larger thin \"crescent\" in telescopic views as it passes along the near side between Earth and the Sun. Venus displays its largest size and \"new phase\" when it is between Earth and the Sun (at inferior conjunction). Its atmosphere is visible through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around it.[174] The phases are clearly visible in a 4\" telescope.[*citation needed*] Although naked eye visibility of Venus's phases is disputed, records exist of observations of its crescent.[176]\n\n\n\n### Daylight apparitions[edit]\n\n\nWhen Venus is sufficiently bright with enough angular distance from the sun, it is easily observed in a clear daytime sky with the naked eye.[177] Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its appearance in the daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg.[178] Another historical daytime observation of the planet took place during the inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4\u00a0March 1865.[179]\n\n\n\n### Transits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transit of Venus\n\n![White disk with a small black dot projected on a screen](image)2012 transit of Venus, projected to a white card by a telescope\nA transit of Venus is the appearance of Venus in front of the Sun, during inferior conjunction. Since the orbit of Venus is slightly inclined relative to Earth's orbit, most inferior conjunctions with Earth, which occur every synodic period of 1.6 years, do not produce a transit of Venus above Earth. Consequently Venus transits above Earth only occur when an inferior conjunction takes place during some days of June or December, the time where the orbits of Venus and Earth cross a straight line with the Sun.[180] This results in Venus transiting above Earth in a sequence of currently 8\u00a0years, 105.5\u00a0years, 8\u00a0years and 121.5\u00a0years, forming cycles of 243\u00a0years.\n\n\nHistorically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Jeremiah Horrocks in 1639 with the first known observation of a Venus transit (after history's first observed planetary transit in 1631, of Mercury).[181]\n\n\nOnly seven Venus transits have been observed so far, since their occurrences were calculated in the 1621 by Johannes Kepler. Captain Cook sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to record the third observed transit of Venus, which subsequently resulted in the exploration of the east coast of Australia.[182][183]\n\n\nThe latest pair was June 8, 2004 and June 5\u20136, 2012. The transit could be watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right equipment and conditions.[184] The preceding pair of transits occurred in December 1874 and December 1882.\n\n\nThe next transit will occur in December 2117 and December 2125.[185]\n\n\n\n### Ashen light[edit]\n\n\nA long-standing mystery of Venus observations is the so-called ashen light\u2014an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.[186][78] The ashen light has often been sighted when Venus is in the evening sky, when the evening terminator of the planet is towards Earth.\n\n\n\n## Observation and exploration history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Observations and explorations of Venus\n\n### Early observation[edit]\n\n\nVenus is in Earth's sky bright enough to be visible without aid, making it one of the star-like classical planets that human cultures have known and identified throughout history, particularly for being the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Sun and the Moon. Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as a single entity;[187] instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star.[187] Nonetheless, a cylinder seal from the Jemdet Nasr period and the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa from the First Babylonian dynasty indicate that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.[188][187][189] In the Old Babylonian period, the planet Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat.[190] The name \"Ninsi'anna\" translates to \"divine lady, illumination of heaven\", which refers to Venus as the brightest visible \"star\". Earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign si4 (= SU, meaning \"to be red\"), and the original meaning may have been \"divine lady of the redness of heaven\", in reference to the colour of the morning and evening sky.[191]\n\n\nThe Chinese historically referred to the morning Venus as \"the Great White\" (*T\u00e0ib\u00e1i* \u592a\u767d) or \"the Opener (Starter) of Brightness\" (*Q\u01d0m\u00edng* \u555f\u660e), and the evening Venus as \"the Excellent West One\" (*Ch\u00e1ngg\u0113ng* \u9577\u5e9a).[192]\n\n\nThe ancient Greeks initially believed Venus to be two separate stars: Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star. Pliny the Elder credited the realization that they were a single object to Pythagoras in the sixth century BC,[193] while Diogenes La\u00ebrtius argued that Parmenides (early fifth century) was probably responsible for this discovery.[194] Though they recognized Venus as a single object, the ancient Romans continued to designate the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer, literally \"Light-Bringer\", and the evening aspect as Vesper,[195] both of which are literal translations of their traditional Greek names.\n\n\nIn the second century, in his astronomical treatise *Almagest*, Ptolemy theorized that both Mercury and Venus were located between the Sun and the Earth. The 11th-century Persian astronomer Avicenna claimed to have observed a transit of Venus (although there is some doubt about it),[196] which later astronomers took as confirmation of Ptolemy's theory.[197] In the 12th century, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah observed \"two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun\"; these were thought to be the transits of Venus and Mercury by 13th-century Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi, though this cannot be true as there were no Venus transits in Ibn Bajjah's lifetime.[198][note 4]\n\n\n\n### Venus and early modern astronomy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIn 1610 Galileo Galilei observed with his telescope that Venus showed phases, despite remaining near the Sun in Earth's sky (first image). This proved that it orbits the Sun and not Earth, as predicted by Copernicus's heliocentric model and disproved Ptolemy's geocentric model (second image).\n\nWhen the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei first observed the planet with a telescope in the early 17th century, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, and when it is closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.[201][202]\n\n\nThe 1639 transit of Venus was accurately predicted by Jeremiah Horrocks and observed by him and his friend, William Crabtree, at each of their respective homes, on 4\u00a0December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar in use at that time).[203]\n\n\n\n![A hand-drawn sequence of images showing Venus passing over the edge of the Sun's disk, leaving an illusory drop of shadow behind](image)The \"black drop effect\" as recorded during the 1769 transit\nThe atmosphere of Venus was discovered in 1761 by Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov.[204][205] Venus's atmosphere was observed in 1790 by German astronomer Johann Schr\u00f6ter. Schr\u00f6ter found when the planet was a thin crescent, the cusps extended through more than 180\u00b0. He correctly surmised this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere. Later, American astronomer Chester Smith Lyman observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction, providing further evidence for an atmosphere.[206] The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schr\u00f6ter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24\u00a0h from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface.[207]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century advances[edit]\n\n\nLittle more was discovered about Venus until the 20th century. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, and it was only with the development of spectroscopic and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed.\n\n\nSpectroscopic observations in the 1900s gave the first clues about the Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been thought.[208]\n\n\nThe first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.[209]\n\n\nIt had been noted that Venus had no discernible oblateness in its disk, suggesting a slow rotation, and some astronomers concluded based on this that it was tidally locked like Mercury was believed to be at the time; but other researchers had detected a significant quantity of heat coming from the planet's nightside, suggesting a quick rotation (a high surface temperature was not suspected at the time), confusing the issue.[210] Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde.\n\n\n\n### Space age[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of missions to Venus\n\nHumanity's first interplanetary spaceflight was achieved in 1961 with the robotic space probe *Venera 1* of the Soviet Venera program flying to Venus, though it lost contact en route.[211]\n\n\nTherefore the first successful interplanetary mission was the *Mariner 2* mission to Venus of the United States' Mariner program, passing on 14 December 1962 at 34,833\u00a0km (21,644\u00a0mi) above the surface of Venus and gathering data on the planet's atmosphere.[212][213]\n\n\nAdditionally radar observations of Venus were first carried out in the 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the actual value.[214]\n\n\n*Venera 3*, launched in 1966, became humanity's first probe and lander to reach and impact another celestial body other than the Moon, but could not return data as it crashed into the surface of Venus. In 1967, *Venera 4* was launched and successfully deployed science experiments in the Venusian atmosphere before impacting. *Venera 4* showed the surface temperature was hotter than *Mariner 2* had calculated, at almost 500\u00a0\u00b0C (932\u00a0\u00b0F), determined that the atmosphere was 95% carbon dioxide (CO  \n2), and discovered that Venus's atmosphere was considerably denser than *Venera 4*'s designers had anticipated.[215]\n\n\nIn an early example of space cooperation the data of *Venera 4* was joined with the 1967 *Mariner 5* data, analysed by a combined Soviet\u2013American science team in a series of colloquia over the following year.[216]\n\n\nOn 15 December 1970, *Venera 7* became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth.[217]\n\n\nIn 1974, *Mariner 10* swung by Venus to bend its path toward Mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds, revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the Venusian atmosphere. This was the first interplanetary gravity assist ever used, a technique which would be used by later probes.\n\n\nRadar observations in the 1970s revealed details of the Venusian surface for the first time. Pulses of radio waves were beamed at the planet using the 300\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0ft) radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory, and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions, designated the Alpha and Beta regions. The observations revealed a bright region attributed to mountains, which was called Maxwell Montes.[218] These three features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)First view and first clear 180-degree panorama of Venus's surface as well as any other planet than Earth (1975, Soviet *Venera\u00a09* lander).

The ground and the probe are the focus.\nIn 1975, the Soviet *Venera 9* and *10* landers transmitted the first images from the surface of Venus, which were in black and white. NASA obtained additional data with the Pioneer Venus project that consisted of two separate missions:[219] the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe and Pioneer Venus Orbiter, orbiting Venus between 1978 and 1992.[220] In 1982 the first colour images of the surface were obtained with the Soviet *Venera\u00a013* and *14* landers. After *Venera 15* and *16* operated between 1983 and 1984 in orbit, conducting detailed mapping of 25% of Venus's terrain (from the north pole to 30\u00b0N latitude), the successful Soviet Venera program came to a close.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)Global topographic map of Venus, with all probe landings marked\nIn 1985 the Vega program with its *Vega 1* and *Vega 2* missions carried the last entry probes and carried the first ever extraterrestrial aerobots for the first time achieving atmospheric flight outside Earth by employing inflatable balloons.\n\n\nBetween 1990 and 1994, *Magellan* operated in orbit until deorbiting, mapping the surface of Venus. Furthermore, probes like *Galileo* (1990),[222] *Cassini\u2013Huygens* (1998/1999), and *MESSENGER* (2006/2007) visited Venus with flybys flying to other destinations.\nIn April 2006, *Venus Express*, the first dedicated Venus mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), entered orbit around Venus. *Venus Express* provided unprecedented observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded the *Venus Express* mission in December 2014 deorbiting it in January 2015.[223]\n\n\nIn 2010, the first successful interplanetary solar sail spacecraft IKAROS traveled to Venus for a flyby.\n\n\n\n### Active and future missions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of missions to Venus \u00a7\u00a0Future missions\n\n![](image)WISPR visible light footage (2021) of the nightside, showing the hot faintly glowing surface, and its Aphrodite Terra as large dark patch, through the clouds, which prohibit such observations on the dayside when they are illuminated.[224][225]\nAs of 2023, the only active mission at Venus is Japan's *Akatsuki*, having achieved orbital insertion on 7\u00a0December 2015. Additionally, several flybys by other probes have been performed and studied Venus on their way, including NASA's Parker Solar Probe, and ESA's Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo.\n\n\nThere are currently several probes under development as well as multiple proposed missions still in their early conceptual stages.\n\n\nVenus has been identified for future research as an important case for understanding:\n\n\n\n* the origins of the solar system and Earth, and if systems and planets like ours are common or rare in the universe.\n* how planetary bodies evolve from their primordial states to today's diverse objects.\n* the development of conditions leading to habitable environments and life.[226]\n\n\n## Search for life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life on Venus\n\nSpeculation on the possibility of life on Venus's surface decreased significantly after the early 1960s when it became clear that conditions were extreme compared to those on Earth. Venus's extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressure make water-based life, as currently known, unlikely.\n\n\nSome scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the cooler, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.[227][228][229] Such speculations go back to 1967, when Carl Sagan and Harold J. Morowitz suggested in a *Nature* article that tiny objects detected in Venus's clouds might be organisms similar to Earth's bacteria (which are of approximately the same size):\n\n\n\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the clouds of Venus are a different story altogether. As was pointed out some years ago, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight\u2014the prerequisites for photosynthesis\u2014are plentiful in the vicinity of the clouds.[230]\nIn August 2019, astronomers led by Yeon Joo Lee reported that long-term pattern of absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of the planet Venus caused by \"unknown absorbers\", which may be chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere of the planet, affect the climate.[75] Their light absorbance is almost identical to that of micro-organisms in Earth's clouds. Similar conclusions have been reached by other studies.[231]\n\n\nIn September 2020, a team of astronomers led by Jane Greaves from Cardiff University announced the likely detection of phosphine, a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the Venusian surface or atmosphere, in the upper levels of the planet's clouds.[232][57][56][233][234] One proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms.[235] The phosphine was detected at heights of at least 30 miles above the surface, and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles. The discovery prompted NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of Venus, describing the phosphine find as \"the most significant development yet in building the case for life off Earth\".[236][237]\n\n\nSubsequent analysis of the data-processing used to identify phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus has raised concerns that the detection-line may be an artefact. The use of a 12th-order polynomial fit may have amplified noise and generated a false reading (see Runge's phenomenon). Observations of the atmosphere of Venus at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which a phosphine absorption line would be expected did not detect phosphine.[238] By late October 2020, re-analysis of data with a proper subtraction of background did not show a statistically significant detection of phosphine.[239][240][241]\n\n\nMembers of the team around Greaves, are working as part of a project by the MIT to send with the rocket company Rocket Lab the first private interplanetary space craft, to look for organics by entering the atmosphere of Venus with a probe, set to launch in January 2025.[242]\n\n\n\n### Planetary protection[edit]\n\n\nThe Committee on Space Research is a scientific organization established by the International Council for Science. Among their responsibilities is the development of recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination. For this purpose, space missions are categorized into five groups. Due to the harsh surface environment of Venus, Venus has been under the planetary protection category two.[243] This indicates that there is only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations.\n\n\n\n## Human presence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of missions to Venus\n\nVenus is the place of the first interplanetary human presence, mediated through robotic missions, with the first successful landings on another planet and extraterrestrial body other than the Moon. Currently in orbit is Akatsuki, and other probes routinely use Venus for gravity assist maneuvers capturing some data about Venus on the way.[244]\n\n\nThe only nation that has sent lander probes to the surface of Venus has been the Soviet Union,[note 5] which has been used by Russian officials to call Venus a \"Russian planet\".[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Crewed flight[edit]\n\n\nStudies of routes for crewed missions to Mars have since the 1960s proposed opposition missions instead of direct conjunction missions with Venus gravity assist flybys, demonstrating that they should be quicker and safer missions to Mars, with better return or abort flight windows, and less or the same amount of radiation exposure from the flight as direct Mars flights.[247][248]\n\n\nEarly in the space age the Soviet Union and the United States proposed the TMK-MAVR and Manned Venus flyby crewed flyby missions to Venus, though they were never realized.\n\n\n\n### Habitation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colonization of Venus and Floating cities and islands in fiction \u00a7\u00a0Venus\n\n![](image)Artist's rendering of a NASA High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) crewed floating outpost on Venus\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus are inhospitable, the atmospheric pressure, temperature, and solar and cosmic radiation 50\u00a0km above the surface are similar to those at Earth's surface.[132][131] With this in mind, Soviet engineer Sergey Zhitomirskiy (\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0416\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, 1929\u20132004) in 1971[249][250] and NASA aerospace engineer Geoffrey A. Landis in 2003[251] suggested the use of aerostats for crewed exploration and possibly for permanent \"floating cities\" in the Venusian atmosphere, an alternative to the popular idea of living on planetary surfaces such as Mars.[252][253] Among the many engineering challenges for any human presence in the atmosphere of Venus are the corrosive amounts of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.[251]\n\n\nNASA's High Altitude Venus Operational Concept is a mission concept that proposed a crewed aerostat design.\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venus in culture\n\n![](image)Venus is portrayed just to the right of the large cypress tree in Vincent van Gogh's 1889 painting *The Starry Night*.[254][255]\nVenus is a primary feature of the night sky, and so has been of remarkable importance in mythology, astrology and fiction throughout history and in different cultures.\n\n\nThe English name of Venus was originally the ancient Roman name for it. Romans named Venus after their goddess of love, who in turn was based on the ancient Greek goddess of love Aphrodite,[256] who was herself based on the similar Sumerian religion goddess Inanna (which is Ishtar in Akkadian religion), all of whom were associated with the planet.[257][258] The weekday of the planet and these goddesses is Friday, named after the Germanic goddess Frigg, who has been associated with the Roman goddess Venus.\n\n\n\n![](image)The eight-pointed star a symbol used in some cultures for Venus, and sometimes combined into a star and crescent arrangement. Here the eight pointed star is the Star of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus goddess, alongside the solar disk of her brother Shamash and the crescent moon of their father Sin on a boundary stone of Meli-Shipak II, dating to the twelfth century BC.\n\nSeveral hymns praise Inanna in her role as the goddess of the planet Venus.[187][258][257] Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna's movements may correspond with the movements of the planet Venus in the sky.[187] The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature.[187] In *Inanna's Descent to the Underworld*, unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East.[187] An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for *Kur*, what could be presumed to be, the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West.[187] In *Inanna and Shukaletuda* and *Inanna's Descent into the Underworld* appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus.[187] In *Inanna and Shukaletuda*, Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons.[259] In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.[187]\n\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks possibly knew by the second millennium BC or at the latest by the Late Period, under mesopotamian influence that the morning star and an evening star were one and the same.[260][261] The Egyptians knew the morning star as *Tioumoutiri* and the evening star as *Ouaiti*.[262] They depicted Venus at first as a phoenix or heron (see Bennu),[260] calling it \"the crosser\" or \"star with crosses\",[260] associating it with Osiris, and later depicting it two-headed with human or falco heads, and associated it with Horus,[261] son of Isis (which during the even later Hellenistic period was together with Hathor identified with Aphrodite). The Greeks used the names *Ph\u014dsphoros* (\u03a6\u03c9\u03c3\u03d5\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"light-bringer\" (whence the element phosphorus; alternately *\u0112\u014dsphoros* (\u1f28\u03c9\u03c3\u03d5\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"dawn-bringer\"), for the morning star, and *Hesperos* (\u1f1d\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"Western one\", for the evening star,[263] both children of dawn Eos and therefore grandchildren of Aphrodite. Though by the Roman era they were recognized as one celestial object, known as \"the star of Venus\", the traditional two Greek names continued to be used, though usually translated to Latin as *L\u016bcifer* and *Vesper*.[263][264]\n\n\nClassical poets such as Homer, Sappho, Ovid and Virgil spoke of the star and its light.[265] Poets such as William Blake, Robert Frost, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth wrote odes to it.[266]\n\n\nIn India, Shukra Graha (\"the planet Shukra\") is named after the powerful saint Shukra. *Shukra* which is used in Indian Vedic astrology[267] means \"clear, pure\" or \"brightness, clearness\" in Sanskrit. One of the nine Navagraha, it is held to affect wealth, pleasure and reproduction; it was the son of Bhrgu, preceptor of the Daityas, and guru of the Asuras.[268] The word *Shukra* is also associated with semen, or generation.\n\n\nVenus is known as Kejora in Indonesian and Malaysian Malay.\n\n\nIn Chinese the planet is called J\u012bn-x\u012bng (\u91d1\u661f), the golden planet of the metal element. Modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the \"metal star\" (\u91d1\u661f), based on the Five elements.[269][270][271][272]\n\n\nThe Maya considered Venus to be the most important celestial body after the Sun and Moon. They called it *Chac ek*,[273] or *Noh Ek*', \"the Great Star\".[274] The cycles of Venus were important to their calendar and were described in some of their books such as *Maya Codex of Mexico* and *Dresden Codex.*\n\n\n\n### Modern culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Venus in fiction\n\nWith the invention of the telescope, the idea that Venus was a physical world and a possible destination began to take form.\n\n\nThe impenetrable Venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was often depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans.[275] The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed reality to be quite different and brought this particular genre to an end.[276] As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.[277]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venus symbol\n\n![](image)\nThe symbol of a circle with a small cross beneath is the so-called Venus symbol, gaining its name for being used as the astronomical symbol for Venus. The symbol is of ancient Greek origin, and represents more generally femininity, adopted by biology as gender symbol for female,[278][279][280] like the Mars symbol for male and sometimes the Mercury symbol for hermaphrodite. This gendered association of Venus and Mars has been used to pair them heteronormatively, describing women and men stereotypically as being so different that they can be understood as coming from different planets, an understanding popularized in 1992 by the book titled *Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus*.[281][282]\n\n\nThe Venus symbol was also used in Western alchemy representing the element copper (like the symbol of Mercury is also the symbol of the element mercury),[279][280] and since polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity the symbol for Venus has sometimes been called Venus mirror, representing the mirror of the goddess, although this origin has been discredited as an unlikely origin.[279][280]\n\n\nBeside the Venus symbol, many other symbols have been associated with Venus, other common ones are the crescent or particularly the star, as with the Star of Ishtar.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Solar System portal\n* ![](image)Outer space portal\n* ![](image)Astronomy portal\n\n\n* Outline of Venus\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n* Venus zone\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Misstated as \"Ganiki Chasma\" in the press release and scientific publication.[116]\n2. **^** The equatorial speed of Earth is given as both about 1674.4\u00a0km/h and 1669.8\u00a0km/h by reliable sources. The simplest way to determine the correct figure is to multiply Earth's radius of 6378137 m (WGS84) and Earth's angular speed, 7.2921150\u00d710\u22125 rad/s,[143] yielding 465.1011 m/s = 1674.364\u00a0km/h. The incorrect figure of 1669.8\u00a0km/h is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by 24\u00a0h. But the correct speed must be relative to inertial space, so the stellar day of 86164.098903691 s/3600 = 23.934472 h (23 h 56 m 4.0989 s) must be used.[144] Thus 2\u03c0(6378.137\u00a0km)/23.934472 h = 1674.364\u00a0km/h.[145]\n3. **^** It is important to be clear about the meaning of \"closeness\". In the astronomical literature, the term \"closest planets\" often refers to the two planets that approach each other the most closely. In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. Essentially because Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is \"closest to Earth when averaged over time\". However, using this time-average definition of \"closeness\", it turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to *all* other planets in the solar system. For that reason, arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme \"More or Less\" explains the different notions of proximity well.[165]\n4. **^** Several claims of transit observations made by medieval Islamic astronomers have been shown to be sunspots.[199] Avicenna did not record the date of his observation. There was a transit of Venus within his lifetime, on 24 May 1032, although it is questionable whether it would have been visible from his location.[200]\n5. **^** The American Pioneer Venus Multiprobe has brought the only non-Soviet probes to enter the atmosphere, as atmospheric entry probes only briefly signals were received from the surface.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Venusian\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

With the Magellan synthetic-aperture radar full-resolution radar map left- and right-look global mosaics at 75 m-per-pixel resolution, we developed a global catalog of volcanoes on Venus that contains ~85,000 edifices, ~99% of which are <5 km in diameter. We find that Venus hosts far more volcanoes than previously mapped, and that although they are distributed across virtually the entire planet, size\u2013frequency distribution analysis reveals a relative lack of edifices in the 20\u2013100 km diameter range, which could be related to magma availability and eruption rate.\n108. **^** Karttunen, Hannu; Kroger, P.; Oja, H.; Poutanen, M.; Donner, K.

This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\n\n\nEarth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76\u00a0\u00b0C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.\n\n\nEarth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000\u00a0km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400\u00a0km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.\n\n\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth with the exception of Antarctica. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Modern English word  *Earth* developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled *eor\u00f0e*.[24] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as \\**er\u00fe\u014d*. In its earliest attestation, the word *eor\u00f0e* was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin *terra* and Greek \u03b3\u1fc6 *g\u0113*: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tell\u016bs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included J\u00f6r\u00f0 ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[25]\n\n\nHistorically, *earth* has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as \"the globe\" was expressed as *the* earth. By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and *the earth* was also written *the Earth*, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as *Earth*, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though *earth* and forms with *the* remain common.[24] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (for example, \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by *the* (for example, \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"[26]\n\n\nOccasionally, the name *Terra* /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259/ is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[27] while in poetry *Tellus* /\u02c8t\u025bl\u0259s/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[28] *Terra* is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish *Tierra* and the French *Terre*). The Latinate form *G\u00e6a* or *Gaea* (English: /\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0.\u0259/) of the Greek poetic name *Gaia* (\u0393\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1; Ancient Greek: [\u0261\u00e2i\u032f.a] or [\u0261\u00e2j.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling *Gaia* has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /\u02c8\u0261a\u026a.\u0259/ rather than the more classical English /\u02c8\u0261e\u026a.\u0259/.[29]\n\n\nThere are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From *Earth* itself comes *earthly*. From the Latin *Terra* comes *terran* /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259n/,[30] terrestrial /t\u0259\u02c8r\u025bstri\u0259l/,[31] and (via French) *terrene* /t\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0n/,[32] and from the Latin *Tellus* comes *tellurian* /t\u025b\u02c8l\u028a\u0259ri\u0259n/[33] and *telluric*.[34]\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Earth and Timeline of natural history\n\n### Formation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early Earth and Hadean\n\n![](image)An artist's impression of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of which Earth and other Solar System bodies were formed\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002  \n\u22120.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[35] By 4.54\u00b10.04\u00a0Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[36] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[37]\n\n\nEstimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.[38] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[39] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[40][41] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8\u00a0Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[42]\n\n\n\n### After formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geological history of Earth\n\n![](image)*Pale orange dot*, an artist's impression of Early Earth, featuring its tinted orange methane-rich early atmosphere[43]\nEarth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[44] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[45] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[46] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[47] By 3.5\u00a0Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[48]\n\n\nAs the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust.[49] The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4\u00a0Ga, only 140\u00a0Ma after Earth's formation.[50] There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance:[51] (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day,[52] which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists,[53][54] which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.[55]\n\n\nNew continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750\u00a0Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600\u2013540\u00a0Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180\u00a0Ma.[56]\n\n\nThe most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40\u00a0Ma,[57] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3\u00a0Ma.[58] High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[59] The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.[60]\n\n\n\n### Origin of life and evolution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Origin of life, Earliest known life forms, and History of life\n\n![](image)Artist's impression of the Archean, the eon after Earth's formation, featuring round stromatolites, which are early oxygen-producing forms of life from billions of years ago. After the Late Heavy Bombardment, Earth's crust had cooled, its water-rich barren surface is marked by continents and volcanoes, with the Moon still orbiting Earth half as close than today, appearing 2.8 times larger and producing strong tides.[61]\nChemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[62] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[63] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[64] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[65] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48\u00a0billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[66] biogenic graphite found in 3.7\u00a0billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[67] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1\u00a0billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[68][69] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[70][71]\n\n\nDuring the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539\u00a0Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"Snowball Earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[72][73] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535\u00a0Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones.[74] Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66\u00a0Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66\u00a0Mys, and several million years ago an African ape species gained the ability to stand upright.[75][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[76]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Future of Earth\n\nSee also: Global catastrophic risk\n![A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun](image)Conjectured illustration of the scorched Earth after the Sun has entered the red giant phase, about 5\u20137 billion years from nowEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1\u00a0billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5\u00a0billion years by 40%.[77] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10\u00a0ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100\u2013900\u00a0million years.[78][79] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[80] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100\u00a0\u00b0C (212\u00a0\u00b0F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[81] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[81][82]\n\n\nThe Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5\u00a0billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1\u00a0AU (150\u00a0million\u00a0km; 93\u00a0million\u00a0mi), about 250 times its present radius.[77][83] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7\u00a0AU (250\u00a0million\u00a0km; 160\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[77]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Geophysics\n\n### Size and shape[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Figure of the Earth\n\nFurther information: Earth radius, Earth's circumference, Earth curvature, and Geomorphology\n\nSee also: List of highest mountains on Earth\n\n![](image)Earth's western hemisphere showing topography relative to Earth's center (instead of to mean sea level, as in common topographic maps)\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium,[84] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918\u00a0mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.\n\n\nDue to Earth's rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its Equator; its diameter is 43 kilometers (27\u00a0mi) longer there than at its poles.[85][86]\nEarth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. Though the largest local variations, like the Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level),[87] only shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%.[n 5][89] Since Earth's surface is farthest out from Earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,384.4\u00a0km or 3,967.1\u00a0mi) is its farthest point out.[90][91]\nParallel to the rigid land topography the Ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.[92]\n\n\nTo measure the local variation of Earth's topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a shape called a geoid. Such a geoid shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but gravitational irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level (MSL) as a reference level for topographic measurements.[93]\n\n\n\n### Surface[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Planetary surface, Land cover, Land, Pedosphere, Ocean, Sea, Cryosphere, and Peplosphere\n\n![](image)A composite image of Earth, with its different types of surface discernible: Earth's surface dominating Ocean (blue), Africa with lush (green) to dry (brown) land and Earth's polar ice in the form of Antarctic sea ice (grey) covering the Antarctic or Southern Ocean and the Antarctic ice sheet (white) covering Antarctica.\nEarth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, Earth's shape is an idealized spheroid \u2013 a squashed sphere \u2013 with a surface area of about 510\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (197\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\n\nMost of Earth's surface is ocean water: 70.8% or 361\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (139\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[94] This vast pool of salty water is often called the *world ocean*,[95][96] and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world[97][98] or ocean world.[99][100] Indeed, in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely.[101] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust, but to a lesser extent with shelf seas also shelves of the continental crust. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes,[85] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.\n\n\nAt Earth's polar regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming polar ice caps.\n\n\nEarth's land covers 29.2%, or 149\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (58\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass).[102][103][104] These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of \u2212418\u00a0m (\u22121,371\u00a0ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797\u00a0m (2,615\u00a0ft).[105]\n\n\nLand can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation,[106] but ice sheets (10%,[107] not including the equally large land under permafrost)[108] or cold as well as hot deserts (33%)[109] occupy also considerable amounts of it.\n\n\nThe pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[110][111] Earth has an estimated 16.7\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (6.4\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of cropland and 33.5\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (12.9\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of pastureland.[112]\n\n\nThe land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth's crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's lithosphere. Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks.[113] Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Relief of Earth's crust\nEarth's surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth's land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4\u00a0km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level.\n\n\nEarth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Plate tectonics\n\n![Shows the extent and boundaries of tectonic plates, with superimposed outlines of the continents they support](image)Earth's major plates, which are:[117]* Pacific Plate\n* African Plate[n 6]\n* North American Plate\n* Eurasian Plate\n* Antarctic Plate\n* Indo-Australian Plate\n* South American Plate\n\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur.[118] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[119]\n\n\nAs the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100\u00a0Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200\u00a0Ma old.[120][121] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030\u00a0Ma,[122] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400\u00a0Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.[50]\n\n\nThe seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55\u00a0Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75\u00a0mm/a (3.0\u00a0in/year)[123] and the Pacific Plate moving 52\u201369\u00a0mm/a (2.0\u20132.7\u00a0in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6\u00a0mm/a (0.42\u00a0in/year).[124]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Internal structure of Earth\n\n\n\nGeologic layers of Earth[125]\n| ![](image)Illustration of Earth's cutaway, not to scale\n |\n| Depth[126](km) | Component layer name\n | Density(g/cm3) |\n| 0\u201360\n | Lithosphere[n 7] | \u2014\n |\n| 0\u201335\n | Crust[n 8] | 2.2\u20132.9\n |\n| 35\u2013660\n | Upper mantle | 3.4\u20134.4\n |\n| 660\u20132890\n | Lower mantle | 3.4\u20135.6\n |\n| 100\u2013700\n | Asthenosphere | \u2014\n |\n| 2890\u20135100\n | Outer core | 9.9\u201312.2\n |\n| 5100\u20136378\n | Inner core | 12.8\u201313.1\n |\n\n\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity.[127] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7\u00a0mi) under the oceans to 30\u201350\u00a0km (19\u201331\u00a0mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.[128]\n\n\nBeneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660\u00a0km (250 and 410\u00a0mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.[129] Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1\u20130.5\u00b0 per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed.[130] The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.\nDensity increases with depth, as described in the table on the right.\n\n\nAmong the Solar System's planetary-sized objects Earth is the object with the highest density.\n\n\n\n### Chemical composition[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Abundance of elements on Earth\n\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97\u00d71024\u00a0kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[131][49] The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.[132][131]\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's internal heat budget\n\n![](image)Global map of heat flow from Earth's interior to the surface of Earth's crust, mostly along the oceanic ridges\nThe major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.[133] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000\u00a0\u00b0C (10,830\u00a0\u00b0F),[134] and the pressure could reach 360\u00a0GPa (52\u00a0million\u00a0psi).[135] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3\u00a0Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.[136][137]\n\n\nThe mean heat loss from Earth is 87\u00a0mW m\u22122, for a global heat loss of 4.42\u00d71013\u00a0W.[138] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts.[139] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.[140]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gravity of Earth\n\nThe gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8\u00a0m/s2 (32\u00a0ft/s2). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's magnetic field\n\n![Diagram showing the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetosphere. The lines are swept back in the anti-solar direction under the influence of the solar wind.](image)Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, with the solar wind flows from left to right\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05\u00d710\u22125 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79\u00d71022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average).[142] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.[143][144]\n\n\nThe extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.[145] Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.[146] Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates.[147][148] The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,[149] and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.[150][151]\n\n\nDuring magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.[152]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's rotation\n\n![](image)Satellite time lapse imagery of Earth's rotation showing axis tilt\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun\u2014its mean solar day\u2014is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[153] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.[154][155]\n\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its *stellar day* by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[2][n 9] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90\u00b0 on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s).[2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4\u00a0ms.[156]\n\n\nApart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15\u00b0/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Orbit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Earth's orbit and Earth's location\n\n![](image)Exaggerated illustration of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, marking that the orbital extreme points (apoapsis and periapsis) are not the same as the four seasonal extreme points (equinox and solstice)\nEarth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System. Earth's average orbital distance is about 150\u00a0million\u00a0km (93\u00a0million\u00a0mi), which is the basis for the Astronomical Unit and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon.\n\n\nEarth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1\u00b0/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12\u00a0hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24\u00a0hours\u2014a solar day\u2014for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.\n\n\nThe orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78\u00a0km/s (107,200\u00a0km/h; 66,600\u00a0mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742\u00a0km (7,918\u00a0mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000\u00a0km (239,000\u00a0mi), in about 3.5 hours.[3]\n\n\nThe Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32\u00a0days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth\u2013Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53\u00a0days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth\u2013Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to \u00b15.1 degrees against the Earth\u2013Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.[3][159]\n\n\nThe Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5\u00a0million\u00a0km (930,000\u00a0mi) in radius.[160][n 10] This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.[160] Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000\u00a0light-years from its center. It is about 20\u00a0light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.[161]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt and seasons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Axial tilt \u00a7\u00a0Earth\n\n![](image)Earth's axial tilt causing different angles of seasonal illumination at different orbital positions around the Sun\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\u00b0[2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.[162] Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.[163][164]\n\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.[165]\n\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6\u00a0years.[166] The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.[167]\n\n\nIn modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.[168][n 11] Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.[169]\n\n\n\n## Earth\u2013Moon system[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Satellite system (astronomy)\n\n### Moon[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Moon, Lunar theory, and Orbit of the Moon\n\n![](image)Earth and the Moon as seen from Mars in an image taken by NASA's *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* on 22 April 2022\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto.[170][171] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.[172] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.[40]\n\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth.[173] The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.[174] As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases.[175] Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38\u00a0mm/a (1.5\u00a0in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23\u00a0\u00b5s/yr\u2014add up to significant changes.[176] During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620\u00a0Ma) there were 400\u00b17 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9\u00b10.4 hours.[177]\n\n\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.[178] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.[179][180]\n\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.[158] This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.[181]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### Asteroids and artificial satellites[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Near-Earth object and Claimed moons of Earth\n\n![](image)A computer-generated image mapping the prevalence of artificial satellites and space debris around Earth in geosynchronous and low Earth orbit\nEarth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa.[184][185] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun.[186] The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.[187]\n\n\nAs of September\u00a02021[update], there are 4,550 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth.[188] There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris.[n 12] Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.[189]\n\n\n\n## Hydrosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrosphere\n\n![](image)A view of Earth with its global ocean and cloud cover, which dominate Earth's surface and hydrosphere. At Earth's polar regions, its hydrosphere forms larger areas of ice cover\nEarth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution.\nMost of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Nevertheless, Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft). The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35\u00d71018\u00a0metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (139.7\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with a mean depth of 3,682\u00a0m (12,080\u00a0ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332\u00a0billion\u00a0km3 (320\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0mi).[190] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8\u00a0km (1.68 to 1.74\u00a0mi).[191] About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.[192][193] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.[194] The remaining 30% is ground water, 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land)[195] and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere, biological binding, etc. .[196][197]\n\n\nIn Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms.[198] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.[199]\n\n\nThe average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35\u00a0grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[200] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[201] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.[202] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.[203] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation.[204]\n\n\nThe abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water.[205] Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.[206]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Earth\n\n![](image)A view of Earth with different layers of its atmosphere visible: the troposphere with its clouds casting shadows, a band of stratospheric blue sky at the horizon, and a line of green airglow of the lower thermosphere around an altitude of 100\u00a0km, at the edge of space\nThe atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325\u00a0kPa (14.696\u00a0psi),[207] with a scale height of about 8.5\u00a0km (5.3\u00a0mi).[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[207] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%[207] but averages about 1%.[3] Clouds cover around two thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land.[208] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) at the poles to 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.[209]\n\n\nEarth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7\u00a0Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen\u2013oxygen atmosphere of today.[63] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[210] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[211] This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F), in contrast to the current +15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F),[212] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[213]\n\n\n\n### Weather and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Weather and Climate\n\n![](image)\nThe ITCZ's band of clouds over the Eastern Pacific and the Americas as seen from space\n![](image)\nWorldwide K\u00f6ppen climate classifications\n\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.[214] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere.[215] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.[216]\n\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.[217] Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[218]\n\n\nEarth receives 1361\u00a0W/m2 of\u00a0solar irradiance.[219][220] The amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C (0.7\u00a0\u00b0F) per degree of latitude from the equator.[221] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.[222]\n\n\nFurther factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.[223] Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land.[224] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land.[225] Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.[226]\n\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.[216] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.[227]\n\n\nThe commonly used K\u00f6ppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.[217] The K\u00f6ppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.[228] Surface air temperature can rise to around 55\u00a0\u00b0C (131\u00a0\u00b0F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as \u221289\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128\u00a0\u00b0F) in Antarctica.[229][230]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earth's atmosphere as it appears from space, as bands of different colours at the horizon. From the bottom, afterglow illuminates the troposphere in orange with silhouettes of clouds, and the stratosphere in white and blue. Next the mesosphere (pink area) extends to just below the edge of space at one hundred kilometers and the pink line of airglow of the lower thermosphere (invisible), which hosts green and red aurorae over several hundred kilometers.\nThe upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere,[231] is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[211] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[232] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, defined as 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[233]\n\n\nThermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[234] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.[235] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.[236] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.[237]\n\n\n\n## Life on Earth[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Biosphere and History of life\n\n![](image)An animation of the changing density of productive vegetation on land (low in brown; heavy in dark green) and phytoplankton at the ocean surface (low in purple; high in yellow)\nEarth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed.\n\n\nEarth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere.[238] Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing changes like the Great Oxidation Event.[239]\n\n\nEarth's life has over time greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes, which are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals.[240] The different biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths, planetary temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity. Earth's species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions. While freezing polar regions and high altitudes, or extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life.[241]\n\n\nEarth provides liquid water\u2014an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism.[242] Plants and other organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.[243]\n\n\nExtreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.[244] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.[245] Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.[246] Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming.[247] This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[248]\n\n\n\n## Human geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human geography\n\nSee also: World\n\n![](image)A composite image of artificial light emissions at night on a map of Earth\nOriginating from earlier primates in eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land.[249] In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.\n\n\nHuman population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s,[250] and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century.[251] Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.[251]\n\n\nDistribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth,[252] partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world's land mass, with 68% of the world's land mass being in the Northern Hemisphere.[253] Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century.[254]\n\n\nBeyond Earth's surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only special purpose deep underground and underwater presence, and a few space stations. Human population virtually completely remains on Earth's surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.[255][256]\n\n\nEarth has been subject to extensive human settlement, and humans have developed diverse societies and cultures. Most of Earth's land has been territorially claimed since the 19th century by sovereign states (countries) separated by political borders, and more than 200 such states exist today,[257] with only parts of Antarctica and few small regions remaining unclaimed.[258] Most of these states together form the United Nations, the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization,[259] which extends human governance over the ocean and Antarctica, and therefore all of Earth.\n\n\n\n### Natural resources and land use[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Natural resource and Land use\n\n![](image)Earth's land use for human agriculture\nEarth has resources that have been exploited by humans.[260] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales.[261] Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.[262] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.[263] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.[264] These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.[265]\n\n\nEarth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.[266] In 2019, 39\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (15\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (4.6\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) was shrub and grassland, 40\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (15\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (4.2\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were cultivated as croplands.[267] Of the 12\u201314% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015.[268] Humans use building materials to construct shelters.[269]\n\n\n\n### Humans and the environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human impact on the environment and Climate change\n\n![The graph from 1880 to 2020 shows natural drivers exhibiting fluctuations of about 0.3 degrees Celsius. Human drivers steadily increase by 0.3 degrees over 100 years to 1980, then steeply by 0.8 degrees more over the past 40 years.](image)Change in average surface air temperature and drivers for that change. Human activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability.[270]\nHuman activities have impacted Earth's environments. Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth's energy budget and climate.[247][271] It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C (2.2\u00a0\u00b0F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline.[272] This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[248]\n\n\nThe concept of planetary boundaries was introduced to quantify humanity's impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five have been crossed: Biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are thought to have passed the safe threshold.[273][274] As of 2018, no country meets the basic needs of its population without transgressing planetary boundaries. It is thought possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within sustainable levels of resource use.[275]\n\n\n\n## Cultural and historical viewpoint[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Earth in culture and Earth symbol\n\n![Woman seeing the Earth from space through a window](image)Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a NASA astronaut, observing Earth from the *Cupola* module at the International Space Station on 11 September 2010\nHuman cultures have developed many views of the planet.[276] The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, ![\ud83d\udf28](image),[277] representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger, ![\u2641](image). Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity.[278] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.[278] The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.[279][280][281]\n\n\nImages of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.[282][283] In particular, this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation,[284] humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally,[285] acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth's environments.\n\n\nScientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides.[286][287] Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.[288]\n\n\nIt was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.[289] Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400\u00a0million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.[290][291]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Celestial sphere\n* Earth phase\n* Earth physical characteristics tables\n* Earth science\n* Extremes on Earth\n* List of Solar System extremes\n* Outline of Earth\n* Table of physical properties of planets in the Solar System\n* Timeline of natural history\n* Timeline of the far future\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** All astronomical quantities vary, both secularly and periodically.

The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname \"**the Red Planet**\".[21][22] Mars's radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5\u00a0km (2,106\u00a0mi). The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide, and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.\n\n\nGeologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping across the landscape and marsquakes (Martian analog to earthquakes) trembling underneath the ground. The surface of Mars hosts a large shield volcano (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). Mars's significant orbital eccentricity and axial tilt cause large seasonal changes to the polar ice caps' coverage and temperature swings between \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212166\u00a0\u00b0F) to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) on the surface. A Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years.\n\n\nLike the other planets in the Solar System, Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to 3.2\u20132 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues to the present, was marked by the wind's influence on geological processes. It is unknown whether life has ever existed on Mars.\n\n\nMars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and thus has been known from ancient times. Its high-contrast albedo features make it a common subject for viewing with a telescope. Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the first flyby by the *Mariner 4* probe in 1965, the first Mars orbiter by the *Mars 2* probe in 1971, and the first landing by *Viking 1* in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11 active probes orbiting Mars or at the Martian surface. Currently, Mars is an attractive target for the first future interplanetary human missions.\n\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geological history of Mars\n\nScientists have theorized that during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created as the result of a random process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are much more common on Mars than on Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.[23]\n\n\nAfter the formation of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called \"Late Heavy Bombardment\". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,[24][25][26] whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300\u00a0mi), or roughly four times the size of the Moon's South Pole \u2013 Aitken basin, the largest impact basin yet discovered.[27] This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy, created the smooth Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.[28][29]\n\n\nA 2023 study shows evidence, based on the orbital inclination of Deimos (a small moon of Mars), that Mars may once had a ring system 3.5 billion years to 4 billion years ago.[30] This ring system may have been formed from a moon, 20 times more massive than Phobos, orbiting Mars billions of years ago; and Phobos would be a remnant of that ring.[31][32]\n\n\nThe geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the three primary periods:[33][34]\n\n\n\n* Noachian period: Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5\u00a0billion years ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period. Named after Noachis Terra.[35]\n* Hesperian period: 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9\u00a0billion years ago. The Hesperian period is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains. Named after Hesperia Planum.[35]\n* Amazonian period: between 3.3 and 2.9\u00a0billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars. Named after Amazonis Planitia.[35]\n\n\nGeological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200\u00a0mya. Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20\u00a0Mya, indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions.[36] The *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* has captured images of avalanches.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Mars\n\n![](image)\nComparison: Earth and Mars\nAnimation (00:40) showing major features of Mars\nVideo (01:28) showing how three NASA orbiters mapped the gravity field of Mars\n\nMars is approximately half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land.[2] Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by ferric oxide, or rust.[39] It can look like butterscotch;[40] other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nLike Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.[41][42] Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16\u201317% sulfur.[43] This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as Earth's.[44] The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 kilometres (78\u00a0mi).[44] By comparison, Earth's crust averages 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) in thickness.[45][46]\n\n\nMars is seismically active. In 2019, it was reported that InSight (now offline) had detected and recorded over 450 marsquakes and related events.[47][48] In 2021 it was reported that based on eleven low-frequency marsquakes detected by the *InSight* lander the core of Mars was indeed liquid and had a radius of about 1830\u00b140\u00a0km and a temperature around 1900\u20132000\u00a0K. The Martian core radius is abnormally large, accounting for more than half the radius of Mars and about half the size of Earth's core. To this, it has been suggested that the core contains some amount of lighter elements like oxygen and hydrogen in addition to the iron\u2013nickel alloy and about 15% of sulfur.[49][50]\n\n\nThe core of Mars is overlaid by the rocky mantle, which does not seem to have a thermally insulating layer analogous to the Earth's lower mantle.[50] The Martian mantle appears to be solid down to the depth of about 500\u00a0km, where the low-velocity zone (partially melted asthenosphere) begins.[51] Below the asthenosphere the velocity of seismic waves starts to grow again; and at the depth of about 1050\u00a0km lies the boundary of the transition zone extending down to the core.[50]\n\n\nFurther analysis of data from the InSight lander has suggested that Mars has a liquid core.[52][53] On 25 October 2023, scientists, helped by information from InSight, reported that Mars has a radioactive magma ocean under its crust.[54]\n\n\n\n### Surface geology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Martian soil\n![](image)*Curiosity*'s view of Martian soil and boulders after crossing the \"Dingo Gap\" sand dune\nMars is a terrestrial planet with a surface that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The Martian surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt,[55] although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth, or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found.[56] Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.[57]\n\n\nAlthough Mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field,[58] observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October\u00a02005 (with the help of the *Mars Global Surveyor*), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.[59]\n\n\nThe *Phoenix* lander returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth. They are necessary for growth of plants.[60] Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate,[61][62] concentrations that are toxic to humans.[63][64]\n\n\nStreaks are common across Mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils.[65] Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.[66][67]\n\n\nRadiation levels on the surface are on average 0.64 millisieverts of radiation per day, and significantly less than the radiation of\u00a01.84 millisieverts per day or 22 millirads per day during the flight to and from Mars.[68][69] For comparison the radiation levels in low Earth orbit, where Earth's space stations orbit, are around 0.5 millisieverts of radiation per day.[70] Hellas Planitia has the lowest surface radiation at about 0.342 millisieverts per day, featuring lava tubes southwest of Hadriacus Mons with potentially levels as low as 0.064 millisieverts per day.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography and features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Mars\n\nFurther information: Areoid\n\nSee also: Category:Surface features of Mars\n\n![](image)A MOLA-based topographic map showing highlands (red and orange) dominating the Southern Hemisphere of Mars, lowlands (blue) the northern. Volcanic plateaus delimit regions of the northern plains, whereas the highlands are punctuated by several large impact basins.\nAlthough better remembered for mapping the Moon, Johann Heinrich M\u00e4dler and Wilhelm Beer were the first areographers. They began by establishing that most of Mars's surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet's rotation period. In 1840, M\u00e4dler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars.[72]\n\n\nFeatures on Mars are named from a variety of sources. Albedo features are named for classical mythology. Craters larger than roughly 50\u00a0km are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of Mars. Smaller craters are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than 100,000. Large valleys are named for the word \"Mars\" or \"star\" in various languages; smaller valleys are named for rivers.[73]\n\n\nLarge albedo features retain many of the older names but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, *Nix Olympica* (the snows of Olympus) has become *Olympus Mons* (Mount Olympus).[74] The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian \"continents\" and given names like Arabia Terra (*land of Arabia*) or Amazonis Planitia (*Amazonian plain*). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum.[75] The permanent northern polar ice cap is named Planum Boreum. The southern cap is called Planum Australe.[76]\n\n\nMars's equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its Prime Meridian was specified, as was Earth's (at Greenwich), by choice of an arbitrary point; M\u00e4dler and Beer selected a line for their first maps of Mars in 1830. After the spacecraft *Mariner 9* provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972, a small crater (later called Airy-0), located in the Sinus Meridiani (\"Middle Bay\" or \"Meridian Bay\"), was chosen by Merton Davies, Harold Masursky, and G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs for the definition of 0.0\u00b0 longitude to coincide with the original selection.[77][78][79]\n\n\nBecause Mars has no oceans and hence no \"sea level\", a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as a reference level; this is called the *areoid*[80] of Mars, analogous to the terrestrial geoid.[81] Zero altitude was defined by the height at which there is 610.5\u00a0Pa (6.105\u00a0mbar) of atmospheric pressure.[82] This pressure corresponds to the triple point of water, and it is about 0.6% of the sea level surface pressure on Earth (0.006 atm).[83]\n\n\nFor mapping purposes, the United States Geological Survey divides the surface of Mars into thirty cartographic quadrangles, each named for a classical albedo feature it contains.[84] In April 2023, *The New York Times* reported an updated global map of Mars based on images from the Hope spacecraft.[85] A related, but much more detailed, global Mars map was released by NASA on 16 April 2023.[86]\n\n\n\n### Volcanoes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanology of Mars\n\n![](image)Picture of the largest volcano on Mars, Olympus Mons. It is approximately 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) across.\nThe vast upland region Tharsis contain several extinct volcanoes, which include the shield volcano Olympus Mons (*Mount Olympus*). The edifice is over 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) wide.[87][88] Because the mountain is so large, with complex structure at its edges, giving a definite height to it is difficult. Its local relief, from the foot of the cliffs which form its northwest margin to its peak, is over 21\u00a0km (13\u00a0mi),[88] a little over twice the height of Mauna Kea as measured from its base on the ocean floor. The total elevation change from the plains of Amazonis Planitia, over 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) to the northwest, to the summit approaches 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi),[89] roughly three times the height of Mount Everest, which in comparison stands at just over 8.8 kilometres (5.5\u00a0mi). Consequently, Olympus Mons is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the Solar System; the only known mountain which might be taller is the Rheasilvia peak on the asteroid Vesta, at 20\u201325\u00a0km (12\u201316\u00a0mi).[90]\n\n\n\n### Impact topography[edit]\n\n\nThe dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. It is possible that, four billion years ago, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of Earth's Moon. If this is the case, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars would be the site of an impact crater 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300\u00a0mi) in size, or roughly the area of Europe, Asia, and Australia combined, surpassing Utopia Planitia and the Moon's South Pole\u2013Aitken basin as the largest impact crater in the Solar System.[91][92][93]\n\n\nMars is scarred by a number of impact craters: a total of 43,000 craters with a diameter of 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) or greater have been found.[94] The largest exposed crater is Hellas, which is 2,300 kilometres (1,400\u00a0mi) wide and 7,000 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) deep, and is a light albedo feature clearly visible from Earth.[95][96] There are other notable impact features, such as Argyre, which is around 1,800 kilometres (1,100\u00a0mi) in diameter,[97] and Isidis, which is around 1,500 kilometres (930\u00a0mi) in diameter.[98] Due to the smaller mass and size of Mars, the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth. Mars is located closer to the asteroid belt, so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source. Mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets, *i.e.*, those that lie within the orbit of Jupiter.[99]\n\n\nMartian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted.[100]\n\n\n\n### Tectonic sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Valles Marineris, taken by the *Viking 1* probe\nThe large canyon, Valles Marineris (Latin for \"Mariner Valleys\", also known as Agathodaemon in the old canal maps[101]), has a length of 4,000 kilometres (2,500\u00a0mi) and a depth of up to 7 kilometres (4.3\u00a0mi). The length of Valles Marineris is equivalent to the length of Europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of Mars. By comparison, the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 446 kilometres (277\u00a0mi) long and nearly 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) deep. Valles Marineris was formed due to the swelling of the Tharsis area, which caused the crust in the area of Valles Marineris to collapse. In 2012, it was proposed that Valles Marineris is not just a graben, but a plate boundary where 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of transverse motion has occurred, making Mars a planet with possibly a two-tectonic plate arrangement.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Holes and caves[edit]\n\n\nImages from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) aboard NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter have revealed seven possible cave entrances on the flanks of the volcano Arsia Mons.[104] The caves, named after loved ones of their discoverers, are collectively known as the \"seven sisters\".[105] Cave entrances measure from 100 to 252 metres (328 to 827\u00a0ft) wide and they are estimated to be at least 73 to 96 metres (240 to 315\u00a0ft) deep. Because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves, they may extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface. \"Dena\" is the only exception; its floor is visible and was measured to be 130 metres (430\u00a0ft) deep. The interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids, UV radiation, solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet's surface.[106][107]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Mars\n\n![see caption](image)Edge-on view of Mars atmosphere by *Viking 1* probe\nMars lost its magnetosphere 4\u00a0billion years ago,[108] possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes,[109] so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer.[110] Both *Mars Global Surveyor* and *Mars Express* have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars,[108][111] and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30\u00a0Pa (0.0044\u00a0psi) on Olympus Mons to over 1,155\u00a0Pa (0.1675\u00a0psi) in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600\u00a0Pa (0.087\u00a0psi).[112] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi)[113] above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of Earth's 101.3\u00a0kPa (14.69\u00a0psi). The scale height of the atmosphere is about 10.8 kilometres (6.7\u00a0mi),[114] which is higher than Earth's 6 kilometres (3.7\u00a0mi), because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's.[115]\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water.[2][116][110] The atmosphere is quite dusty, containing particulates about 1.5 \u03bcm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface.[117] It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it.[21] The concentration of methane in the Martian atmosphere fluctuates from about 0.24 ppb during the northern winter to about 0.65 ppb during the summer.[118] Estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6 to 4 years,[119][120] so its presence indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Methane could be produced by non-biological process such as serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars,[121] or by Martian life.[122]\n\n![](image)Escaping atmosphere on Mars (carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen) by MAVEN in UV[123]\nCompared to Earth, its higher concentration of atmospheric CO2 and lower surface pressure may be why sound is attenuated more on Mars, where natural sources are rare apart from the wind. Using acoustic recordings collected by the *Perseverance* rover, researchers concluded that the speed of sound there is approximately 240\u00a0m/s for frequencies below 240\u00a0Hz, and 250\u00a0m/s for those above.[124][125]\n\n\nAuroras have been detected on Mars.[126][127][128] Because Mars lacks a global magnetic field, the types and distribution of auroras there differ from those on Earth;[129] rather than being mostly restricted to polar regions as is the case on Earth, a Martian aurora can encompass the planet.[130] In September 2017, NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled, and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, solar storm in the middle of the month.[130][131]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Mars\n\n![](image)Mars without (on left) and with a global dust storm in July 2001 (on right), as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope\nOf all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212166\u00a0\u00b0F) to highs of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) in equatorial summer.[15] The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure (about 1% that of the atmosphere of Earth), and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil.[132] The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.[133][134]\n\n\nIf Mars had an Earth-like orbit, its seasons would be similar to Earth's because its axial tilt is similar to Earth's. The comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect. Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere and winter in the north, and near aphelion when it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere and summer in the north. As a result, the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case. The summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F).[135]\n\n\nMars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System, reaching speeds of over 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph). These can vary from a storm over a small area, to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and have been shown to increase global temperature.[136]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water on Mars\n\n![](image)The ice-filled Korolev crater near Mars's north pole is estimated to hold about 2,200\u00a0km3 (530\u00a0cu\u00a0mi), comparable in volume to the Great Bear Lake.\nWater in its liquid form cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% that of Earth,[137] except at the lowest of elevations for short periods.[42][138] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[139][140] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be enough to cover the entire surface of the planet with a depth of 11 metres (36\u00a0ft).[141] Large quantities of ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of Mars. Radar data from *Mars Express* and the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* (MRO) show large quantities of ice at both poles,[142][143] and at middle latitudes.[144] The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on 31 July 2008.[145]\n\n\nLandforms visible on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet's surface. Huge linear swathes of scoured ground, known as outflow channels, cut across the surface in about 25 places. These are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers, though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava.[146][147] One of the larger examples, Ma'adim Vallis, is 700 kilometres (430\u00a0mi) long, much greater than the Grand Canyon, with a width of 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) and a depth of 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) in places. It is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in Mars's history.[148] The youngest of these channels is thought to have formed only a few million years ago.[149]\n\n\nElsewhere, particularly on the oldest areas of the Martian surface, finer-scale, dendritic networks of valleys are spread across significant proportions of the landscape. Features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by runoff resulting from precipitation in early Mars history. Subsurface water flow and groundwater sapping may play important subsidiary roles in some networks, but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases.[150]\n\n\nAlong craters and canyon walls, there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the Southern Hemisphere and face the Equator; all are poleward of 30\u00b0 latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice,[151][152] although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust.[153][154] No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active.[152] Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history.[155] Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across a large proportion of the surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.[156] Further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and goethite, both of which sometimes form in the presence of water.[157]\n\n\n\n### Polar caps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Martian polar ice caps\n\n![](image)\nNorth polar early summer water ice cap (1999); a seasonal layer of carbon dioxide ice forms in winter and disappears in summer.\n![](image)\nSouth polar midsummer ice cap (2000); the south cap has a permanent carbon dioxide ice cap covered with water ice.[158]\n\nMars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25\u201330% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice).[159] When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the *Opportunity* rover in 2004.[160]\n\n\nThe caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick. This permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by flat floored, shallow, roughly circular pits, which repeat imaging shows are expanding in some places and retreating in others.[161] The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi),[162] and contains about 1.6\u00a0million cubic kilometres (5.7\u00d71016\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of ice, which, if spread evenly on the cap, would be 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) thick.[163] (This compares to a volume of 2.85\u00a0million cubic kilometres (1.01\u00d71017\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) and a thickness of 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi).[164] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.6\u00a0million cubic km.[165] Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which a recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis effect.[166][167]\n\n\nThe seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology \u2013 especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Observations and findings of water evidence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chronology of discoveries of water on Mars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nProportion of water ice present in the upper meter of the Martian surface for lower (top) and higher (bottom) latitudes\n\nIn 2004, *Opportunity* detected the mineral jarosite. This forms only in the presence of acidic water, showing that water once existed on Mars.[170][171] The *Spirit* rover found concentrated deposits of silica in 2007 that indicated wet conditions in the past, and in December 2011, the mineral gypsum, which also forms in the presence of water, was found on the surface by NASA's Mars rover Opportunity.[172][173][174] It is estimated that the amount of water in the upper mantle of Mars, represented by hydroxyl ions contained within Martian minerals, is equal to or greater than that of Earth at 50\u2013300 parts per million of water, which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 200\u20131,000 metres (660\u20133,280\u00a0ft).[175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maps of buried ice on Mars (26 October 2023)\n![](image)Map of subsurface water ice on Mars (26 October 2023)\nOn 18 March 2013, NASA reported evidence from instruments on the *Curiosity* rover of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of \"Tintina\" rock and \"Sutton Inlier\" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like \"Knorr\" rock and \"Wernicke\" rock.[177][178] Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in), during the rover's traverse from the *Bradbury Landing* site to the *Yellowknife Bay* area in the *Glenelg* terrain.[177] In September 2015, NASA announced that they had found strong evidence of hydrated brine flows in recurring slope lineae, based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes.[179][180][181] These streaks flow downhill in Martian summer, when the temperature is above \u221223\u00a0\u00b0C, and freeze at lower temperatures.[182] These observations supported earlier hypotheses, based on timing of formation and their rate of growth, that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing just below the surface.[183] However, later work suggested that the lineae may be dry, granular flows instead, with at most a limited role for water in initiating the process.[184] A definitive conclusion about the presence, extent, and role of liquid water on the Martian surface remains elusive.[185][186]\n\n\nResearchers suspect much of the low northern plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this theory remains controversial.[187] In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of protium to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium (D/H = 9.3 \u00b1 1.7 10-4) is five to seven times the amount on Earth (D/H = 1.56 10-4), suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the *Curiosity* rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.[188] Near the northern polar cap is the 81.4 kilometres (50.6\u00a0mi) wide Korolev Crater, which the Mars Express orbiter found to be filled with approximately 2,200 cubic kilometres (530\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water ice.[189]\n\n\nIn November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior (which is 12,100 cubic kilometres[190]).[191][192] During observations from 2018 through 2021, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spotted indications of water, probably subsurface ice, in the Valles Marineris canyon system.[193]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit of Mars\n\nSee also: Timekeeping on Mars\n\n![Mars circling the Sun further and slower than Earth](image)Orbit of Mars and other Inner Solar System planets\nMars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230\u00a0million\u00a0km (143\u00a0million\u00a0mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.[194] A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.[2]\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Mars is 25.19\u00b0 relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth.[2] As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.[20]\n\n\nMars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; of the seven other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35\u00a0million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much less than that of Earth today.[195] Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years.[196]\n\n\nMars approaches Earth in a synodic period of 779.94 days. Earth orbits the Sun the closest to Mars's orbit around the Sun, and Mars orbit is the second closest to Earth after the orbit of Venus. Therefore, their closest approaches, the inferior conjunctions, are the second closest for Earth after those with Venus, and the closest for Mars to any other planet. The gravitational potential difference, and thus the delta-v needed to transfer between Mars and Earth is the second lowest for Earth and the lowest for Mars to any other planet, while transfers can possibly be optimized with Venus flybys.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Moons of Mars, Phobos (moon), and Deimos (moon)\n\n![](image)\nEnhanced-color HiRISE image of Phobos, showing a series of mostly parallel grooves and crater chains, with Stickney crater at right\n![](image)\nEnhanced-color HiRISE image of Deimos (not to scale), showing its smooth blanket of regolith\n\nMars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons, Phobos (about 22 kilometres (14\u00a0mi) in diameter) and Deimos (about 12 kilometres (7.5\u00a0mi) in diameter), which orbit close to the planet. The origin of both moons is unclear, although a popular theory states that they were asteroids captured into Martian orbit.[199]\n\n\nBoth satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall and were named after the characters Phobos (the deity of panic and fear) and Deimos (the deity of terror and dread), twins from Greek mythology who accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle.[200] Mars was the Roman equivalent to Ares. In modern Greek, the planet retains its ancient name *Ares* (Aris: *\u0386\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2*).[92]\n\n\nFrom the surface of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear different from that of the Earth's satellite, the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit\u00a0\u2013 where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation\u00a0\u2013 rises as expected in the east, but slowly. Because the orbit of Phobos is below a synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50\u00a0million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.[201]\n\n\nThe origin of the two satellites is not well understood. Their low albedo and carbonaceous chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting a capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point toward a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects, and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early in the history of Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.[202] Mars may have yet-undiscovered moons, smaller than 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330\u00a0ft) in diameter, and a dust ring is predicted to exist between Phobos and Deimos.[203]\n\n\nA third possibility for their origin as satellites of Mars is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior,[204] and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars,[205] point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's satellite. Although the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.[205] It is also possible that Phobos and Deimos were fragments of an older moon, formed by debris from a large impact on Mars, and then destroyed by a more recent impact upon the satellite.[206]\n\n\n\n## Human observations and exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Exploration of Mars and History of Mars observation\n\nThe history of observations of Mars is marked by oppositions of Mars when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.[207]\n\n\n\n### Ancient and medieval observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei was the first to see Mars via telescope.\nThe ancient Sumerians named Mars Nergal, the god of war and plague. During Sumerian times, Nergal was a minor deity of little significance, but, during later times, his main cult center was the city of Nineveh.[208] In Mesopotamian texts, Mars is referred to as the \"star of judgement of the fate of the dead\".[209] The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was also recorded by the ancient Egyptian astronomers and, by 1534 BCE, they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet.[210] By the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations of their behavior. For Mars, they knew that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. They invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets.[211][212] In Ancient Greece, the planet was known as \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.[213] Commonly, the Greek name for the planet now referred to as Mars, was Ares. It was the Romans who named the planet Mars, for their god of war, often represented by the sword and shield of the planet's namesake.[214]\n\n\nIn the fourth century BCE, Aristotle noted that Mars disappeared behind the Moon during an occultation, indicating that the planet was farther away.[215] Ptolemy, a Greek living in Alexandria,[216] attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection later called the *Almagest* (from the Arabic for \"greatest\"), which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.[217] Literature from ancient China confirms that Mars was known by Chinese astronomers by no later than the fourth century BCE.[218] In the East Asian cultures, Mars is traditionally referred to as the \"fire star\" based on the *Wuxing* system.[219][220][221]\n\n\nDuring the seventeenth century A.D., Tycho Brahe measured the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet.[222] From Brahe's observations of Mars, Kepler deduced that the planet orbited the Sun not in a circle, but in an ellipse. Moreover, Kepler showed that Mars sped up as it approached the Sun and slowed down as it moved farther away, in a manner that later physicists would explain as a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.[223]:\u200a433\u2013437 When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments.[224] The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of 13 October 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg.[225] In 1610, Mars was viewed by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope.[226] The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.[227]\n\n\n\n### Martian \"canals\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Martian canals\n\n![](image)A 1962 map of Mars published by the U.S. Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, showing canals snaking through the Martian landscape. At the time, the existence canals was still highly controversial as no close-up pictures of Mars had been taken (until Mariner 4's flyby in 1965).\nBy the 19th century, the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified. On 5 September 1877, a perihelic opposition to Mars occurred. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli used a 22-centimetre (8.7\u00a0in) telescope in Milan to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called *canali*, which were later shown to be an optical illusion. These *canali* were supposedly long, straight lines on the surface of Mars, to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term, which means \"channels\" or \"grooves\", was popularly mistranslated in English as \"canals\".[228][229]\n\n\nInfluenced by the observations, the orientalist Percival Lowell founded an observatory which had 30- and 45-centimetre (12- and 18-in) telescopes. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894, and the following less favorable oppositions. He published several books on Mars and life on the planet, which had a great influence on the public.[230][231] The *canali* were independently observed by other astronomers, like Henri Joseph Perrotin and Louis Thollon in Nice, using one of the largest telescopes of that time.[232][233]\n\n\nThe seasonal changes (consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during Martian summers) in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on Mars, and it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. As bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight *canali* were observed. During observations in 1909 by Antoniadi with an 84-centimetre (33\u00a0in) telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no *canali* were seen.[234]\n\n\n\n### Robotic exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Self-portrait of *Perseverance* rover and *Ingenuity* helicopter (left) at Wright Brothers Field, 2021\nDozens of crewless spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been sent to Mars by the Soviet Union, the United States, Europe, India, the United Arab Emirates, and China to study the planet's surface, climate, and geology.[235] NASA's *Mariner 4* was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; launched on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. *Mariner 4* detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images of another planet from deep space.[236]\n\n\nOnce spacecraft visited the planet during NASA's Mariner missions in the 1960s and 1970s, many previous concepts of Mars were radically broken. After the results of the *Viking* life-detection experiments, the hypothesis of a dead planet was generally accepted.[237] The data from *Mariner 9* and *Viking* allowed better maps of Mars to be made, and the *Mars Global Surveyor* mission, which launched in 1996 and operated until late 2006, produced complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals.[238] These maps are available online at websites including Google Mars. Both the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* and *Mars Express* continued exploring with new instruments and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with *Curiosity*.[239][240]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Mars is host to thirteen functioning spacecraft. Eight are in orbit*: 2001 Mars Odyssey*, *Mars Express*, *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter*, *MAVEN*, *ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter*, the *Hope* orbiter, and the *Tianwen-1* orbiter.[241][242] Another five are on the surface: the Mars Science Laboratory *Curiosity* rover, the *Perseverance* rover, the *Ingenuity* helicopter, the *Tianwen-1* lander, and the *Zhurong* rover.[243]\n\n\nPlanned missions to Mars include the *Rosalind Franklin* rover mission, designed to search for evidence of past life, which was intended to be launched in 2018 but has been repeatedly delayed, with a launch date pushed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more likely one sometime in 2028.[244][245][246] A current concept for a joint NASA-ESA mission to return samples from Mars would launch in 2026.[247][248]\n\n\n\n![Map of Mars](image)Interactive image map of the global topography of Mars, overlaid with the position of Martian rovers and landers.

W. Campbell at Lick Observatory observed the planet and found that \"if water vapor or oxygen occur in the atmosphere of Mars it is in quantities too small to be detected by spectroscopes then available\".[249] That observation contradicted many of the measurements of the time and was not widely accepted.[249] Campbell and V. M. Slipher repeated the study in 1909 using better instruments, but with the same results. It was not until the findings were confirmed by W. S. Adams in 1925 that the myth of the Earth-like habitability of Mars was finally broken.[249] However, even in the 1960s, articles were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem were being published as late as 1962.[250]\n\n\nThe current understanding of planetary habitability\u00a0\u2013 the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life\u00a0\u2013 favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun is estimated to extend from within the orbit of Earth to about that of Mars.[251] During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.[252]\n\n\nThe environmental conditions on Mars are a challenge to sustaining organic life: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, it has poor insulation against bombardment by the solar wind due to the absence of a magnetosphere and has insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.[253]\n\n\n\n![see caption](image)Scoop of Mars soil by *Curiosity*, October 2012\n*In situ* investigations have been performed on Mars by the *Viking* landers, *Spirit* and *Opportunity* rovers, *Phoenix* lander, and *Curiosity* rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The *Viking* probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase in CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that *Viking* may have found life.[254] Tests conducted by the *Phoenix Mars* lander have shown that the soil has an alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.[255] The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.[256]\n\n\nA 2014 analysis of Martian meteorite EETA79001 found chlorate, perchlorate, and nitrate ions in sufficiently high concentrations to suggest that they are widespread on Mars. UV and X-ray radiation would turn chlorate and perchlorate ions into other, highly reactive oxychlorines, indicating that any organic molecules would have to be buried under the surface to survive.[257]\n\n\nScientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which is thought to have originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15\u00a0million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.[258] Small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.[259][260] Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinite.[121] Impact glass, formed by the impact of meteors, which on Earth can preserve signs of life, has also been found on the surface of the impact craters on Mars.[261][262] Likewise, the glass in impact craters on Mars could have preserved signs of life, if life existed at the site.[263][264][265]\n\n\n\n### Human mission proposals[edit]\n\n\nSeveral plans for a human mission to Mars have been proposed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, but none have come to fruition. The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to study the feasibility of a crewed Mars mission in the early 2030s; the resulting report eventually concluded that this would be unfeasible.[266][267] In addition, in 2021, China was planning to send a crewed Mars mission in 2033.[268] Privately held companies such as SpaceX have also proposed plans to send humans to Mars, with the eventual goal to settle on the planet.[269] The moon Phobos has been proposed as an anchor point for a space elevator.[270]\n\n\n\n## Viewing from Earth[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astronomy on Mars\n![see caption](image)Mars seen through an 16-inch amateur telescope, at 2020 opposition\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Mars is +0.71 with a standard deviation of 1.05.[18] Because the orbit of Mars is eccentric, the magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from about \u22123.0 to \u22121.4.[271] The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.86 when the planet is near aphelion and in conjunction with the Sun.[18] At its brightest, Mars (along with Jupiter) is second only to Venus in apparent brightness.[18] Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. Mars is usually close enough for particularly good viewing once or twice at 15-year or 17-year intervals.[272] As Mars approaches opposition, it begins a period of retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping curve with respect to the background stars. This retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak apparent brightness in the middle of this interval.[273]\n\n\nThe point at which Mars's geocentric longitude is 180\u00b0 different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of its closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and 103\u00a0million\u00a0km (34 and 64\u00a0million\u00a0mi) due to the planets' elliptical orbits, which causes comparable variation in angular size.[274][275] The most recent Mars opposition occurred on 8 December 2022, at a distance of about 82\u00a0million\u00a0km (51\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[276] The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its synodic period, is 780 days; but the number of days between successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.[196]\n\n\nMars comes into opposition from Earth every 2.1 years. The planets come into opposition near Mars's perihelion in 2003, 2018 and 2035, with the 2020 and 2033 events being particularly close to perihelic opposition.[207][277] Mars made its closest approach to Earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,000 years, 55,758,006\u00a0km (0.37271925\u00a0AU; 34,646,419\u00a0mi), magnitude \u22122.88, on 27 August 2003, at 09:51:13 UTC. This occurred when Mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its perihelion, making it particularly easy to see from Earth. The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on 12 September 57,617 BC, the next time being in 2287.[278] This record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches.[196]\n\n\nOptical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190\u00a0mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.[279]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mars in culture and Mars in fiction\n\nSee also: Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Mars\n\n![](image)*The War of the Worlds* by H. G. Wells, 1897, depicts an invasion of Earth by fictional Martians.\nMars is named after the Roman god of war. This association between Mars and war dates back at least to Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of war and destruction.[280][281] It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, whose famous first movement labels Mars \"the bringer of war\".[282] The planet's symbol, a circle with a spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender.[283] The symbol dates from at least the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.[284]\n\n\nThe idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians became widespread in the late 19th century. Schiaparelli's \"canali\" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works.[285] Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed \"Mars Fever\".[286] High-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars revealed no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still continues. Reminiscent of the *canali* observations, these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as \"pyramids\" and the \"Face on Mars\".[287] In his book *Cosmos*, planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: \"Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.\"[229]\n\n\nThe depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life.[288] This gave way to many science fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells's *The War of the Worlds*, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth; Ray Bradbury's *The Martian Chronicles*, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization; as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs's series *Barsoom*, C. S. Lewiss novel *Out of the Silent Planet* (1938),[289] and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.[290] Since then, depictions of Martians have also extended to animation. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin the Martian, appeared in *Haredevil Hare* (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.[291] After the *Mariner* and *Viking* spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as a lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars were abandoned; for many science-fiction authors, the new discoveries initially seemed like a constraint, but eventually the post-*Viking* knowledge of Mars became itself a source of inspiration for works like Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars* trilogy.[292]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Overview of and topical guide to Mars\n* List of missions to Mars\n* Magnetic field of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Past magnetic field of the planet Mars\n* Mineralogy of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Overview of the mineralogy of Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** The light filters are 635 nm, 546 nm, and 437 nm, which corresponds to red, green and blue\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c***  Best-fit ellipsoid\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Simon, J.L.; Bretagnon, P.; Chapront, J.; Chapront-Touz\u00e9, M.; Francou, G.; Laskar, J.

It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20\u00a0AU (778.5\u00a0Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86\u00a0years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\n\n\nJupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to comprise an outer mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.\n\n\nJupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\n\n\nSince 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\nIn both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine pantheon: Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the Romans.[17] The International Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976, and has since named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers, favourites, and descendants.[18] The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ![\u2643](image), descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, \u27e8\u01b5\u27e9, as an abbreviation for *Zeus*.[19][20]\n\n\nIn Latin, *Iovis* is the genitive case of *Iuppiter*, i.e. Jupiter. It is associated with the etymology of *Zeus* ('sky father'). The English equivalent, *Jove*, is only known to have come into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[21]\n\n\n*Jovian* is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form *jovial*, employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean 'happy' or 'merry', moods ascribed to Jupiter's influence in astrology.[22]\n\n\nThe original Greek deity *Zeus* supplies the root *zeno-*, which is used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as *zenographic*.[c]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand tack hypothesis\n See also: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nJupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System.[23] Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line: a distance from the early Sun where the temperature was sufficiently cold for volatiles such as water to condense into solids.[24] The planet began as a solid core, which then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the planet must have formed before the solar nebula was fully dispersed.[25] During its formation, Jupiter's mass gradually increased until it had 20 times the mass of the Earth, approximately half of which was made up of silicates, ices and other heavy-element constituents.[23] When the proto-Jupiter grew larger than 50 Earth masses it created a gap in the solar nebula.[23] Thereafter, the growing planet reached its final mass in 3\u20134 million years.[23]\n\n\nAccording to the \"grand tack hypothesis\", Jupiter began to form at a distance of roughly 3.5\u00a0AU (520\u00a0million\u00a0km; 330\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward.[24][26] This upset the orbits of several super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively.[27] Saturn would later have begun to migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, until the two planets became captured in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5\u00a0AU (220\u00a0million\u00a0km; 140\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun.[28] This changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system to their current locations.[27] All of this happened over a period of 3\u20136 million years, with the final migration of Jupiter occurring over several hundred thousand years.[26][29] Jupiter's migration from the inner solar system eventually allowed the inner planets\u2014including Earth\u2014to form from the rubble.[30]\n\n\nThere are several unresolved issues with the grand tack hypothesis. The resulting formation timescales of terrestrial planets appear to be inconsistent with the measured elemental composition.[31] It is likely that Jupiter would have settled into an orbit much closer to the Sun if it had migrated through the solar nebula.[32] Some competing models of Solar System formation predict the formation of Jupiter with orbital properties that are close to those of the present day planet.[25] Other models predict Jupiter forming at distances much farther out, such as 18\u00a0AU (2.7\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 1.7\u00a0billion\u00a0mi).[33][34]\n\n\nAccording to the Nice model, infall of proto-Kuiper belt objects over the first 600 million years of Solar System history caused Jupiter and Saturn to migrate from their initial positions into a 1:2 resonance, which caused Saturn to shift into a higher orbit, disrupting the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, depleting the Kuiper belt, and triggering the Late Heavy Bombardment.[35]\n\n\nBased on Jupiter's composition, researchers have made the case for an initial formation outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20\u201330\u00a0AU (3.0\u20134.5\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 1.9\u20132.8\u00a0billion\u00a0mi) from the Sun, and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40\u00a0AU (6.0\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 3.7\u00a0billion\u00a0mi).[36][37] Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have, over a roughly 700,000-year period, migrated inwards to its current location.[33][34] during an epoch approximately 2\u20133\u00a0million years after the planet began to form. In this model, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.[33]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nJupiter is a gas giant, being primarily composed of gas and liquid rather than solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 142,984\u00a0km (88,846\u00a0mi) at its equator, giving it a volume 1,321 times that of the Earth.[2][38] Its average density, 1.326\u00a0g/cm3, [d] is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\nBy mass, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 76% hydrogen and 24% helium, though, because helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume.[42] The atmosphere also contains trace amounts of methane, water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds as well as fractional amounts of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur.[43] The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia.[44] Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found.[45] The interior of Jupiter contains denser materials\u2014by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.[46][47]\n\n\nThe atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula.[48] Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.[49] Jupiter's helium abundance is about 80% that of the Sun due to precipitation of these elements as helium-rich droplets, a process that happens deep in the planet's interior.[50][51]\n\n\nBased on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more of the next most common elements, including oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.[52] Those planets are known as ice giants, because the majority of their volatile compounds are in solid form.[53]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jupiter mass\n\n![see caption](image)Jupiter with its moon Europa on the left. Earth's diameter is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and 4 times larger than Europa.\nJupiter's mass is 318 times that of Earth;[2] 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is so massive that its barycentre with the Sun lies above the Sun's surface at 1.068\u00a0solar radii from the Sun's centre.[54] [55]:\u200a6 Jupiter's radius is about one tenth the radius of the Sun,[56] and its mass is one thousandth the mass of the Sun, as the densities of the two bodies are similar.[57] A \"Jupiter mass\" (MJ or MJup) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects, particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. For example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69\u00a0MJ, while the brown dwarf Gliese 229 b has a mass of 60.4\u00a0MJ.[58][59]\n\n\nTheoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had over 40% more mass, the interior would be so compressed that its volume would *decrease* despite the increasing amount of matter. For smaller changes in its mass, the radius would not change appreciably.[60] As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve.[61] The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved.[62] Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times more massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star,[63] its diameter is sufficient as the smallest red dwarf may be only slightly larger in radius than Saturn.[64]\n\n\nJupiter radiates more heat than it receives through solar radiation, due to the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism within its contracting interior.[65]:\u200a30[66] This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 1\u00a0mm (0.039\u00a0in)/yr.[67][68] At the time of its formation, Jupiter was hotter and was about twice its current diameter.[69]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Jupiter, its interior, surface features, rings, and inner moons.\nBefore the early 21st century, most scientists proposed one of two scenarios for the formation of Jupiter. If the planet accreted first as a solid body, it would consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet,[70] and an outer atmosphere consisting primarily of molecular hydrogen.[68] Alternatively, if the planet collapsed directly from the gaseous protoplanetary disk, it was expected to completely lack a core, consisting instead of a denser and denser fluid (predominantly molecular and metallic hydrogen) all the way to the centre. Data from the *Juno* mission showed that Jupiter has a diffuse core that mixes into its mantle, extending for 30\u201350% of the planet's radius, and comprising heavy elements with a combined mass 7\u201325 times the Earth.[71][72][73][74][75] This mixing process could have arisen during formation, while the planet accreted solids and gases from the surrounding nebula.[76] Alternatively, it could have been caused by an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.[77][78]\n\n\nOutside the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above molecular hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.3 MPa and critical temperature of 33\u00a0K (\u2212240.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212400.3\u00a0\u00b0F).[79] In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases\u2014hydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state. The hydrogen and helium gas extending downward from the cloud layer gradually transitions to a liquid in deeper layers, possibly resembling something akin to an ocean of liquid hydrogen and other supercritical fluids.[65]:\u200a22[80][81][82] Physically, the gas gradually becomes hotter and denser as depth increases.[83][84]\n\n\nRain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through the lower atmosphere, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere.[50][85] Calculations suggest that helium drops separate from metallic hydrogen at a radius of 60,000\u00a0km (37,000\u00a0mi) (11,000\u00a0km (6,800\u00a0mi) below the cloud tops) and merge again at 50,000\u00a0km (31,000\u00a0mi) (22,000\u00a0km (14,000\u00a0mi) beneath the clouds).[86] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur, as well as on Saturn[87] and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[88]\n\n\nThe temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily inward as the heat of planetary formation can only escape by convection.[51] At a surface depth where the atmospheric pressure level is 1\u00a0bar (0.10\u00a0MPa), the temperature is around 165\u00a0K (\u2212108\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212163\u00a0\u00b0F). The region where supercritical hydrogen changes gradually from a molecular fluid to a metallic fluid spans pressure ranges of 50\u2013400\u00a0GPa with temperatures of 5,000\u20138,400\u00a0K (4,730\u20138,130\u00a0\u00b0C; 8,540\u201314,660\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively. The temperature of Jupiter's diluted core is estimated to be 20,000\u00a0K (19,700\u00a0\u00b0C; 35,500\u00a0\u00b0F) with a pressure of around 4,000\u00a0GPa.[89]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Jupiter\n\n![](image)Timelapse of Jupiter's cloud system moving over the course of one month (photographed during Voyager 1 flyby in 1979)\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter extends to a depth of 3,000\u00a0km (2,000\u00a0mi) below the cloud layers.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Cloud layers[edit]\n\n\nJupiter is perpetually covered with clouds of ammonia crystals, which may contain ammonium hydrosulfide as well.[90] The clouds are located in the tropopause layer of the atmosphere, forming bands at different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are subdivided into lighter-hued *zones* and darker *belts*. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100 metres per second (360\u00a0km/h; 220\u00a0mph) are common in zonal jet streams.[91] The zones have been observed to vary in width, colour and intensity from year to year, but they have remained stable enough for scientists to name them.[55]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of Jupiter's south pole\n![](image)\nEnhanced colour view of Jupiter's southern storms\n\nThe cloud layer is about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) deep, and consists of at least two decks of ammonia clouds: a thin clearer region on top with a thick lower deck. There may be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia clouds, as suggested by flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter.[92] These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on Earth.[93] The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the interior.[94] The Juno mission revealed the presence of \"shallow lightning\" which originates from ammonia-water clouds relatively high in the atmosphere.[95] These discharges carry \"mushballs\" of water-ammonia slushes covered in ice, which fall deep into the atmosphere.[96] Upper-atmospheric lightning has been observed in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, bright flashes of light that last around 1.4 milliseconds. These are known as \"elves\" or \"sprites\" and appear blue or pink due to the hydrogen.[97][98]\n\n\nThe orange and brown colours in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change colour when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be made up of phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.[65]:\u200a39[99] These colourful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer clouds of the lower deck. The light-coloured zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallising ammonia that hides the chromophores from view.[100]\n\n\nJupiter has a low axial tilt, thus making it that the poles always receive less solar radiation than the planet's equatorial region. Convection within the interior of the planet transports energy to the poles, balancing out temperatures at the cloud layer.[55]:\u200a54\n\n\n\n#### Great Red Spot and other vortices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Close-up of the Great Red Spot imaged by the *Juno* spacecraft in April 2018\nA well-known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot,[101] a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22\u00b0 south of the equator. It was first observed in 1831,[102] and possibly as early as 1665.[103][104] Images by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown two more \"red spots\" adjacent to the Great Red Spot.[105][106] The storm is visible through Earth-based telescopes with an aperture of 12\u00a0cm or larger.[107] The oval object rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about six days.[108] The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) above the surrounding cloud tops.[109] The Spot's composition and the source of its red colour remain uncertain, although photodissociated ammonia reacting with acetylene is a likely explanation.[110]\n\n\nThe Great Red Spot is larger than the Earth.[111] Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and will be a permanent feature of the planet.[112] However, it has significantly decreased in size since its discovery. Initial observations in the late 1800s showed it to be approximately 41,000\u00a0km (25,500\u00a0mi) across. By the time of the *Voyager* flybys in 1979, the storm had a length of 23,300\u00a0km (14,500\u00a0mi) and a width of approximately 13,000\u00a0km (8,000\u00a0mi).[113] *Hubble* observations in 1995 showed it had decreased in size to 20,950\u00a0km (13,020\u00a0mi), and observations in 2009 showed the size to be 17,910\u00a0km (11,130\u00a0mi). As of 2015[update], the storm was measured at approximately 16,500 by 10,940\u00a0km (10,250 by 6,800\u00a0mi),[113] and was decreasing in length by about 930\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi) per year.[111][114] In October 2021, a *Juno* flyby mission measured the depth of the Great Red Spot, putting it at around 300\u2013500 kilometres (190\u2013310\u00a0mi).[115]\n\n\n*Juno* missions show that there are several polar cyclone groups at Jupiter's poles. The northern group contains nine cyclones, with a large one in the centre and eight others around it, while its southern counterpart also consists of a centre vortex but is surrounded by five large storms and a single smaller one for a total of 7 storms.[116][117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Formation of Oval BA from three white ovals\nIn 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature\u2014these three smaller white ovals were formed in 1939\u20131940. The merged feature was named Oval BA. It has since increased in intensity and changed from white to red, earning it the nickname \"Little Red Spot\".[118][119]\n\n\nIn April 2017, a \"Great Cold Spot\" was discovered in Jupiter's thermosphere at its north pole. This feature is 24,000\u00a0km (15,000\u00a0mi) across, 12,000\u00a0km (7,500\u00a0mi) wide, and 200\u00a0\u00b0C (360\u00a0\u00b0F) cooler than surrounding material. While this spot changes form and intensity over the short term, it has maintained its general position in the atmosphere for more than 15 years. It may be a giant vortex similar to the Great Red Spot, and appears to be quasi-stable like the vortices in Earth's thermosphere. This feature may be formed by interactions between charged particles generated from Io and the strong magnetic field of Jupiter, resulting in a redistribution of heat flow.[120]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Magnetosphere of Jupiter\n\n![](image)\nAurorae on the north and south poles  \n(animation)\n![](image)\nAurorae on the north pole  \n(Hubble)\n![](image)\nInfrared view of southern lights  \n(Jovian IR Mapper)\n\nJupiter's magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in the Solar System,[100] with a dipole moment of 4.170 gauss (0.4170\u00a0mT) that is tilted at an angle of 10.31\u00b0 to the pole of rotation. The surface magnetic field strength varies from 2 gauss (0.20\u00a0mT) up to 20 gauss (2.0\u00a0mT).[121] This field is thought to be generated by eddy currents\u2014swirling movements of conducting materials\u2014within the liquid, metallic hydrogen core. At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath\u2014a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from solar wind.[65]:\u200a69\n\n\nThe volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide, forming a gas torus along its orbit. The gas is ionized in Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet, causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of a magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature, with short, superimposed bursts in the range of 0.6\u201330\u00a0MHz that are detectable from Earth with consumer-grade shortwave radio receivers.[122][123] As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfv\u00e9n waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the radio output of the Sun.[124]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Jupiter\n\nJupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.[125] These rings appear to be made of dust, whereas Saturn's rings are made of ice.[65]:\u200a65 The main ring is most likely made out of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis, which is drawn into Jupiter because of the planet's strong gravitational influence. New material is added by additional impacts.[126] In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea are believed to produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring.[126] There is evidence of a fourth ring that may consist of collisional debris from Amalthea that is strung along the same moon's orbit.[127]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![see caption](image)Orbit of Jupiter and other outer Solar System planets\nJupiter is the only planet whose barycentre with the Sun lies outside the volume of the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius.[128][129] The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778\u00a0million\u00a0km (5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86\u00a0years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance.[130] The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30\u00b0 compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.049, Jupiter is slightly over 75\u00a0million\u00a0km nearer the Sun at perihelion than aphelion,[2] which means that its orbit is nearly circular. This low eccentricity is at odds with exoplanet discoveries, which have revealed Jupiter-sized planets with very high eccentricities. Models suggest this may be due to there being only two giant planets in our Solar System, as the presence of a third or more giant planets tends to induce larger eccentricities.[131]\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small, only 3.13\u00b0, so its seasons are insignificant compared to those of Earth and Mars.[132]\n\n\nJupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an amateur telescope. Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5\u00a0minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere.[133] The planet is an oblate spheroid, meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles.[84] On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is 9,276\u00a0km (5,764\u00a0mi) longer than the polar diameter.[2]\n\n\nThree systems are used as frames of reference for tracking planetary rotation, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies to latitudes from 7\u00b0\u00a0N to 7\u00b0\u00a0S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50\u00a0m 30.0s. System II applies at latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55\u00a0m 40.6s.[134] System III was defined by radio astronomers and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.[135]\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![see caption](image)Jupiter and four Galilean moons seen through an amateur telescope\nJupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon, and Venus),[100] although at opposition Mars can appear brighter than Jupiter. Depending on Jupiter's position with respect to the Earth, it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as \u22122.94 at opposition down to \u22121.66 during conjunction with the Sun.[14] The mean apparent magnitude is \u22122.20 with a standard deviation of 0.33.[14] The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 30.5 arc seconds.[2] Favourable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through the perihelion of its orbit, bringing it closer to Earth.[136] Near opposition, Jupiter will appear to go into retrograde motion for a period of about 121 days, moving backward through an angle of 9.9\u00b0 before returning to prograde movement.[137]\n\n\nBecause the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth is always less than 11.5\u00b0; thus, Jupiter always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained.[138] A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A larger telescope with an aperture of 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315\u00a0cm) will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.[139][140]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-telescopic research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model in the *Almagest* of the longitudinal motion of Jupiter (\u2609) relative to Earth (\ud83d\udf28)\nObservation of Jupiter dates back to at least the Babylonian astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC.[141] The ancient Chinese knew Jupiter as the \"*Su\u00ec* Star\" (*Su\u00ecx\u012bng* \u6b72\u661f) and established their cycle of 12 earthly branches based on the approximate number of years it takes Jupiter to rotate around the Sun; the Chinese language still uses its name (simplified as \u6b72) when referring to years of age. By the 4th century BC, these observations had developed into the Chinese zodiac,[142] and each year became associated with a Tai Sui star and god controlling the region of the heavens opposite Jupiter's position in the night sky. These beliefs survive in some Taoist religious practices and in the East Asian zodiac's twelve animals. The Chinese historian Xi Zezong has claimed that Gan De, an ancient Chinese astronomer,[143] reported a small star \"in alliance\" with the planet,[144] which may indicate a sighting of one of Jupiter's moons with the unaided eye. If true, this would predate Galileo's discovery by nearly two millennia.[145][146]\n\n\nA 2016 paper reports that trapezoidal rule was used by Babylonians before 50 BCE for integrating the velocity of Jupiter along the ecliptic.[147] In his 2nd century work the *Almagest*, the Hellenistic astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus constructed a geocentric planetary model based on deferents and epicycles to explain Jupiter's motion relative to Earth, giving its orbital period around Earth as 4332.38\u00a0days, or 11.86\u00a0years.[148]\n\n\n\n### Ground-based telescope research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo's drawings of Jupiter and its \"Medicean Stars\" from *Sidereus Nuncius*\nIn 1610, Italian polymath Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons) using a telescope. This is thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. Just one day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614.[149] It was Marius's names for the major moons, however, that stuck: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The discovery was a major point in favour of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory led to him being tried and condemned by the Inquisition.[150]\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1639, the Neapolitan optician Francesco Fontana tested a 22-palm telescope of his own making and discovered the characteristic bands of the planet's atmosphere.[151]\n\n\nDuring the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new telescope to discover spots in Jupiter's atmosphere, observe that the planet appeared oblate, and estimate its rotation period.[152] In 1692, Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes a differential rotation.[153]\n\n\nThe Great Red Spot may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.[154] The Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878.[155] It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century.[156]\n\n\nBoth Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of Jupiter's moons, which allowed predictions of when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, Cassini observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17\u00a0minutes later than expected. Ole R\u00f8mer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected),[47] and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.[157][158]\n\n\nIn 1892, E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch (910\u00a0mm) refractor at Lick Observatory in California. This moon was later named Amalthea.[159] It was the last planetary moon to be discovered directly by a visual observer through a telescope.[160] An additional eight satellites were discovered before the flyby of the Voyager 1 probe in 1979.[e]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jupiter viewed in infrared by JWST  \n(July 14, 2022)\nIn 1932, Rupert Wildt identified absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of Jupiter.[161] Three long-lived anticyclonic features called \"white ovals\" were observed in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.[162]\n\n\n\n### Radiotelescope research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Image of Jupiter and its radiation belts in radio\nIn 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin discovered that Jupiter emits bursts of radio waves at a frequency of 22.2\u00a0MHz.[65]:\u200a36 The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they used this information to determine a more precise value for Jupiter's rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) lasting less than a hundredth of a second.[163]\n\n\nScientists have discovered three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter:\n\n\n\n* Decametric radio bursts (with a wavelength of tens of metres) vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are influenced by the interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.[164]\n* Decimetric radio emission (with wavelengths measured in centimetres) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959.[65]:\u200a36 The origin of this signal is a torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator, which generates cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.[165]\n* Thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere of Jupiter.[65]:\u200a43\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Jupiter\n\nJupiter has been visited by automated spacecraft since 1973, when the space probe *Pioneer 10* passed close enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about its properties and phenomena.[166][167] Missions to Jupiter are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Entering a Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter from low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of 6.3\u00a0km/s,[168] which is comparable to the 9.7\u00a0km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[169] Gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Flyby missions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spacecraft\n | Closest approach\n | Distance (km)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *Pioneer 10* | December 3, 1973\n | 130,000\n |\n| *Pioneer 11* | December 4, 1974\n | 34,000\n |\n| *Voyager 1* | March 5, 1979\n | 349,000\n |\n| *Voyager 2* | July 9, 1979\n | 570,000\n |\n| *Ulysses* | February 8, 1992[171] | 408,894\n |\n| February 4, 2004[171] | 120,000,000\n |\n| *Cassini* | December 30, 2000\n | 10,000,000\n |\n| *New Horizons* | February 28, 2007\n | 2,304,535\n |\n\n\nBeginning in 1973, several spacecraft performed planetary flyby manoeuvres that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter and the amount of polar flattening.[55]:\u200a47[172]\n\n\nSix years later, the Voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Spot had changed hues since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, which were found to come from erupting volcanoes on the moon's surface. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.[55]:\u200a87[173]\n\n\nThe next mission to encounter Jupiter was the *Ulysses* solar probe. In February 1992, it performed a flyby manoeuvre to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft studied Jupiter's magnetosphere, although it had no cameras to photograph the planet. The spacecraft passed by Jupiter six years later, this time at a much greater distance.[171]\n\n\nIn 2000, the *Cassini* probe flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn, and provided higher-resolution images.[174]\n\n\nThe *New Horizons* probe flew by Jupiter in 2007 for a gravity assist en route to Pluto.[175] The probe's cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail.[176]\n\n\n\n#### *Galileo* mission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Galileo (spacecraft)\n\n![](image)*Galileo* in preparation for mating with the rocket, 1989\nThe first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the *Galileo* mission, which reached the planet on December 7, 1995.[61] It remained in orbit for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 when it collided with Jupiter in 1994. Some of the goals for the mission were thwarted due to a malfunction in *Galileo'*s high-gain antenna.[177]\n\n\nA 340-kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.[61] It parachuted through 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) of the atmosphere at a speed of about 2,575\u00a0km/h (1600\u00a0mph)[61] and collected data for 57.6\u00a0minutes until the spacecraft was destroyed.[178] The *Galileo* orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003. NASA destroyed the spacecraft to avoid any possibility of the spacecraft crashing into and possibly contaminating the moon Europa, which may harbour life.[177]\n\n\nData from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90% of Jupiter's atmosphere.[61] The recorded temperature was more than 300\u00a0\u00b0C (570\u00a0\u00b0F) and the windspeed measured more than 644\u00a0km/h (>400\u00a0mph) before the probes vaporized.[61]\n\n\n\n#### *Juno* mission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Juno (spacecraft)\n\n![see caption](image)*Juno* preparing for testing in a rotation stand, 2011\nNASA's *Juno* mission arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016 with the goal of studying the planet in detail from a polar orbit. The spacecraft was originally intended to orbit Jupiter thirty-seven times over a period of twenty months.[179][73][180] During the mission, the spacecraft will be exposed to high levels of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere, which may cause future failure of certain instruments.[181] On August 27, 2016, the spacecraft completed its first fly-by of Jupiter and sent back the first-ever images of Jupiter's north pole.[182]\n\n\n*Juno* completed 12 orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.[183] In June of that year, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021, and in January of that year the mission was extended to September 2025 with four lunar flybys: one of Ganymede, one of Europa, and two of Io.[184][185] When *Juno* reaches the end of the mission, it will perform a controlled deorbit and disintegrate into Jupiter's atmosphere. This will avoid the risk of collision with Jupiter's moons.[186][187]\n\n\n\n#### Cancelled missions and future plans[edit]\n\n\nThere is great interest in missions to study Jupiter's larger icy moons, which may have subsurface liquid oceans.[188] Funding difficulties have delayed progress, causing NASA's *JIMO* (*Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter*) to be cancelled in 2005.[189] A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA/ESA mission called EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter.[190] However, the ESA formally ended the partnership in April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection.[191] These plans have been realized as the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), launched on April 14, 2023,[192] followed by NASA's *Europa Clipper* mission, scheduled for launch in 2024.[193]\n\n\n\nViews of Jupiter from JunoCam\nOther proposed missions include the Chinese National Space Administration's *Tianwen-4* mission which aims to launch an orbiter to the Jovian system and possibly Callisto around 2035,[194] and CNSA's *Interstellar Express*[195] and NASA's *Interstellar Probe*,[196] which would both use Jupiter's gravity to help them reach the edges of the heliosphere.\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Jupiter\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons and Satellite system (astronomy)\n\nJupiter has 95 known natural satellites,[7] and it is likely that this number would go up in the future due to improved instrumentation.[197] Of these, 79 are less than 10\u00a0km in diameter.[7] The four largest moons are Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa (in order of decreasing size), collectively known as the \"Galilean moons\", and are visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night.[198]\n\n\n\n### Galilean moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Galilean moons\n\nThe moons discovered by Galileo\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto\u2014are among the largest in the Solar System. The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbours at the same point in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.[199]\n\n\nThe eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. The friction created by this tidal flexing generates heat in the interior of the moons.[200] This is seen most dramatically in the volcanic activity of Io (which is subject to the strongest tidal forces),[200] and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface, which indicates recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior.[201]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nThe Galilean moons compared to the Earth's Moon\n| Name\n | IPA | Diameter\n | Mass\n | Orbital radius\n | Orbital period\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| km\n | *D*\u263e | kg\n | *M*\u263e | km\n | *a*\u263e | days\n | *T*\u263e |\n| Io | /\u02c8a\u026a.o\u028a/ | 3,643\n | 1.05\n | 8.9\u00d71022 | 1.20\n | 421,700\n | 1.10\n | 1.77\n | 0.07\n |\n| Europa | /j\u028a\u02c8ro\u028ap\u0259/ | 3,122\n | 0.90\n | 4.8\u00d71022 | 0.65\n | 671,034\n | 1.75\n | 3.55\n | 0.13\n |\n| Ganymede | /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6nimi\u02d0d/ | 5,262\n | 1.50\n | 14.8\u00d71022 | 2.00\n | 1,070,412\n | 2.80\n | 7.15\n | 0.26\n |\n| Callisto | /k\u0259\u02c8l\u026asto\u028a/ | 4,821\n | 1.40\n | 10.8\u00d71022 | 1.50\n | 1,882,709\n | 4.90\n | 16.69\n | 0.61\n |\n\n |\n| ![The Galilean moons.

Jupiter's moons are currently divided into several different groups, although there are several moons which are not part of any group.[203]\n\n\nThe eight innermost regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator, are thought to have formed alongside Jupiter, whilst the remainder are irregular moons and are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. The irregular moons within each group may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.[204][205]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Regular moons\n |\n| --- |\n| Inner group | The inner group of four small moons all have diameters of less than 200\u00a0km, orbit at radii less than 200,000\u00a0km, and have orbital inclinations of less than half a degree.[206] |\n| Galilean\u00a0moons[207] | These four moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei and by Simon Marius in parallel, orbit between 400,000 and 2,000,000\u00a0km, and are some of the largest moons in the Solar System.\n |\n| Irregular moons\n |\n| Himalia group | A tightly clustered group of prograde-orbiting moons with orbits around 11,000,000\u201312,000,000\u00a0km from Jupiter.[208] |\n| Carpo group | A sparsely populated group of small moons with highly inclined prograde orbits around 16,000,000\u201317,000,000\u00a0km from Jupiter.[7] |\n| Ananke\u00a0group | This group of retrograde-orbiting moons has rather indistinct borders, averaging 21,276,000\u00a0km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 149 degrees.[205] |\n| Carme group | A tightly clustered group of retrograde-orbiting moons that averages 23,404,000\u00a0km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 165 degrees.[205] |\n| Pasiphae group | A dispersed and only vaguely distinct retrograde group that covers all the outermost moons.[209] |\n\n\n## Interaction with the Solar System[edit]\n\n\nAs the most massive of the eight planets, the gravitational influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. With the exception of Mercury, the orbits of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane. The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter,[210] and the planet may have been responsible for the purported Late Heavy Bombardment in the inner Solar System's history.[211]\n\n\nIn addition to its moons, Jupiter's gravitational field controls numerous asteroids that have settled around the Lagrangian points that precede and follow the planet in its orbit around the Sun. These are known as the Trojan asteroids, and are divided into Greek and Trojan \"camps\" to honour the *Iliad*. The first of these, 588 Achilles, was discovered by Max Wolf in 1906; since then more than two thousand have been discovered.[212] The largest is 624 Hektor.[213]\n\n\nThe Jupiter family is defined as comets that have a semi-major axis smaller than Jupiter's; most short-period comets belong to this group. Members of the Jupiter family are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close encounters with Jupiter, they are perturbed into orbits with a smaller period, which then becomes circularized by regular gravitational interactions with the Sun and Jupiter.[214]\n\n\n\n### Impacts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Impact events on Jupiter\n\n![](image)Brown spots mark Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9's impact sites on Jupiter\nJupiter has been called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner[215] because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner Solar System. There are more impacts on Jupiter, such as comets, than on any other planet in the Solar System.[216] For example, Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.[61] In the past, scientists believed that Jupiter partially shielded the inner system from cometary bombardment.[61] However, computer simulations in 2008 suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them.[217] This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt, while others believe that Jupiter protects Earth from the Oort cloud.[218]\n\n\nIn July 1994, the Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 comet collided with Jupiter.[219][220] The impacts were closely observed by observatories around the world, including the Hubble Space Telescope and *Galileo* spacecraft.[221][222][223][224] The event was widely covered by the media.[225]\n\n\nSurveys of early astronomical records and drawings produced eight examples of potential impact observations between 1664 and 1839. However, a 1997 review determined that these observations had little or no possibility of being the results of impacts. Further investigation by this team revealed a dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 may have been an impact scar.[226]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jupiter in fiction and Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Jupiter\n\n![](image)Jupiter, woodcut from a 1550 edition of Guido Bonatti's *Liber Astronomiae*\nThe existence of the planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low.[227] To the Babylonians, this planet represented their god Marduk,[228] chief of their pantheon from the Hammurabi period.[229] They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.[228]\n\n\nThe mythical Greek name for this planet is *Zeus* (\u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), also referred to as *Dias* (\u0394\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek.[230] The ancient Greeks knew the planet as Phaethon (\u03a6\u03b1\u03ad\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd), meaning \"shining one\" or \"blazing star\".[231][232] The Greek myths of Zeus from the Homeric period showed particular similarities to certain Near-Eastern gods, including the Semitic El and Baal, the Sumerian Enlil, and the Babylonian god Marduk.[233] The association between the planet and the Greek deity Zeus was drawn from Near Eastern influences and was fully established by the fourth century BCE, as documented in the *Epinomis* of Plato and his contemporaries.[234]\n\n\nThe god Jupiter is the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and he is the principal god of Roman mythology. The Romans originally called Jupiter the \"star of Jupiter\" (*Iuppiter Stella*), as they believed it to be sacred to its namesake god. This name comes from the Proto-Indo-European vocative compound \\**Dy\u0113u-p\u0259ter* (nominative: \\**Dy\u0113us-p\u0259t\u0113r*, meaning \"Father Sky-God\", or \"Father Day-God\").[235] As the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter was the god of thunder, lightning, and storms, and was appropriately called the god of light and sky.[236]\n\n\nIn Vedic astrology, Hindu astrologers named the planet after Brihaspati, the religious teacher of the gods, and often called it \"Guru\", which means the \"Teacher\".[237][238] In Central Asian Turkic myths, Jupiter is called *Erendiz* or *Erent\u00fcz*, from *eren* (of uncertain meaning) and *yultuz* (\"star\"). The Turks calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days. They believed that some social and natural events connected to Erent\u00fcz's movements on the sky.[239] The Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese called it the \"wood star\" (Chinese: \u6728\u661f; pinyin: *m\u00f9x\u012bng*), based on the Chinese Five Elements.[240][241][242] In China it became known as the \"Year-star\" (Sui-sing) as Chinese astronomers noted that it jumped one zodiac constellation each year (with corrections). In some ancient Chinese writings the years were named, at least in principle, in correlation with the Jovian zodiac signs.[243]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Infrared view of Jupiter, imaged by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai\u02bbi, January 11, 2017](image)\n\nInfrared view of Jupiter, imaged by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai\u02bbi, January 11, 2017\n* ![Jupiter imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, January 11, 2017](image)\n\nJupiter imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, January 11, 2017\n* ![Ultraviolet view of Jupiter by Hubble, January 11, 2017[244]](image)\n\nUltraviolet view of Jupiter by Hubble, January 11, 2017[244]\n* ![Jupiter and Europa, taken by Hubble on 25 August 2020, when the planet was 653 million kilometres from Earth.[245]](image)\n\nJupiter and Europa, taken by Hubble on 25 August 2020, when the planet was 653 million kilometres from Earth.[245]\n* ![Infrared photo by James Webb Space Telescope, August 2022[246]](image)\n\nInfrared photo by James Webb Space Telescope, August 2022[246]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Overview of and topical guide to Jupiter\n* Eccentric Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Jovian planet that orbits its star in an eccentric orbit\n* Hot Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Class of high mass planets orbiting close to a star\n* Super-Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Class of planets with more mass than Jupiter\n* Jovian\u2013Plutonian gravitational effect\u00a0\u2013 Astronomical hoax\n* List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n2. **^** Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n3. **^** See for example: \"IAUC 2844: Jupiter; 1975h\".

It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[28][29][30]\n\n\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[31] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).\n\n\nThe planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons[32] are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[33]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\nSaturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (![\u2644](image)) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho ligature with a horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for *\u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2* (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet (![](image)).[34]\nIt later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize this pagan symbol. \n\n\nThe Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, *S\u0101turni di\u0113s* (\"Saturn's Day\"), for the planet Saturn.[35]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nSaturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core.[36] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than its polar radius: 60,268\u00a0km versus 54,364\u00a0km.[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96\u00a0m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36\u00a0km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[37]\n\n\nSaturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water\u2014about 30% less.[38] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69\u00a0g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass,[39] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Saturn, to scaleDespite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01\u00a0g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.[40]\n\n\nStandard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles.[41] Analysis of the distortion shows that Saturn is substantially more centrally condensed than Jupiter and therefore contains a significantly larger amount of material denser than hydrogen near its centre. Saturn's central regions contain about 50% hydrogen by mass, while Jupiter's contain approximately 67% hydrogen.[42]\n\n\nThis core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9\u201322 times the mass of Earth,[43][44] which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000\u00a0km.[45] However, measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to about 17 Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire radius.[46] This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000\u00a0km and consists of gas.[47][48][49]\n\n\nSaturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700\u00a0\u00b0C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be the generation of heat through the \"raining out\" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.[50][51] These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[41] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter[52] and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[53]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nThe outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.[54] The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.[41] The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19\u201331 times the mass of Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.[55]\n\n\nTrace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.[56][57][58] The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water.[59] Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.[58] *Cassini* observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes, nicknamed the \"String of Pearls\". These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Cloud layers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A global storm girdles the planet in 2011. The storm passes around the planet, such that the storm's head (bright area) passes its tail.\nSaturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the *Voyager* spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.[61]\n\n\nThe composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with temperatures in the range of 100\u2013160\u00a0K and pressures extending between 0.5\u20132 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185 to 270\u00a0K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3\u20136 bar with temperatures of 190\u2013235\u00a0K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar and temperatures are 270\u2013330\u00a0K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.[62]\n\n\nSaturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the *Voyager* encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot, a short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice.[63] Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the best observed.[64] The latest giant storm was observed in 2010. In 2015, researchers used Very Large Array telescope to study Saturnian atmosphere, and reported that they found \"long-lasting signatures of all mid-latitude giant storms, a mixture of equatorial storms up to hundreds of years old, and potentially an unreported older storm at 70\u00b0N\".[65]\n\n\nThe winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. *Voyager* data indicate peak easterly winds of 500\u00a0m/s (1,800\u00a0km/h).[66] In images from the *Cassini* spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering.[67] Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System.[68] Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally \u2212185\u00a0\u00b0C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as \u2212122\u00a0\u00b0C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Hexagonal cloud patterns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saturn's hexagon\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSaturn's north and south pole in infrared\n\nA persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78\u00b0N was first noted in the *Voyager* images.[69][70][71] The sides of the hexagon are each about 14,500\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) long, which is longer than the diameter of the Earth.[72] The entire structure rotates with a period of 10h 39m 24s (the same period as that of the planet's radio emissions) which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn's interior.[73] The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere.[74] The pattern's origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.[75][76]\n\n\nHST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream, but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave.[77] NASA reported in November 2006 that *Cassini* had observed a \"hurricane-like\" storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall.[78][79] Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth. For example, images from the *Galileo* spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.[80]\n\n\nThe south pole storm may have been present for billions of years.[81] This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth, and it has winds of 550\u00a0km/h.[81]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Magnetosphere of Saturn\n\n![](image)Auroral lights at Saturn's north pole\nSaturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape\u2014a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator\u20140.2\u00a0gauss (\u00b5T)\u2014is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field.[31] As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's.[82] When *Voyager 2* entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1\u00a0million km (712,000\u00a0mi),[83] although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days.[84] Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter\u2014by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo.[82] This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere.[31] Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.[85]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Animation of Saturn and the Solar System's outer planets orbiting around the Sun\n![](image)Simulated appearance of Saturn as seen from Earth (at opposition) during an orbit of Saturn, 2001\u20132029The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4\u00a0billion kilometers (9\u00a0AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68\u00a0km/s,[6] it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about 29+1\u20442\u00a0years)[86] to finish one revolution around the Sun.[6] As a consequence, it forms a near 5:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.[87] The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48\u00b0 relative to the orbital plane of the Earth.[6] The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957\u00a0AU, on average.[6][88] The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude, and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).\n\n\nAstronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. *System\u00a0I* has a period of 10h 14m 00s (844.3\u00b0/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to *System\u00a0I*. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as *System\u00a0II* and have been assigned a rotation period of 10h 38m 25.4s (810.76\u00b0/d). *System\u00a0III* refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet detected by *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2*,[89] System\u00a0III has a rotation period of 10h 39m 22.4s (810.8\u00b0/d). System\u00a0III has largely superseded System\u00a0II.[90]\n\n\nA precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, *Cassini* found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10h 45m 45s \u00b1 36s.[91][92] An estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the *Cassini*, *Voyager* and *Pioneer* probes is 10h 32m 35s.[93] Studies of the planet's C Ring yield a rotation period of 10h 33m 38s + 1m 52s  \n\u2212 1m 19s\u2009.[17][18]\n\n\nIn March 2007, it was found that the variation in radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.[94][95][96]\n\n\nAn apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable Lagrangian points, designated L4 and L5, located at 60\u00b0 angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have been discovered for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Orbital resonance mechanisms, including secular resonance, are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.[97]\n\n\n\n## Natural satellites[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Saturn\n\n![](image)Artist conception of Saturn, its rings and major icy moons\u2014from Mimas to Rhea\nSaturn has 146 known moons, 63 of which have formal names.[12][11] It is estimated that there are other 100\u00b130 outer irregular moons larger than 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) in diameter.[98]\nIn addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40\u2013500 meters in Saturn's rings,[99] which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.[100] Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own,[101] along with a tenuous atmosphere.[102][103][104]\n\n\nMany of the other moons are small: 131 are less than 50\u00a0km in diameter.[105] Traditionally, most of Saturn's moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology. Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere,[106][107] in which a complex organic chemistry occurs. It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes.[108][109]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life.[110] On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.[111]\n\n\nSaturn's moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets,[112] has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life.[113][114][115][116] Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite's salt-rich particles having an \"ocean-like\" composition that indicates most of Enceladus's expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water.[117][118][119] A 2015 flyby by *Cassini* through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the A Ring, which was imaged by *Cassini* on 15 April 2013.[121]\n\n\n\n## Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Saturn\n\n![](image)The rings of Saturn (imaged here by *Cassini* in 2007) are the most massive and conspicuous in the Solar System.[48]\nSaturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique.[48] The rings extend from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers (4,120 to 75,000\u00a0mi) outward from Saturn's equator and average approximately 20 meters (66\u00a0ft) in thickness. They are composed predominantly of water ice, with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately 7% amorphous carbon.[122] The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10\u00a0m.[123] While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.\n\n\nThere are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn, for which a research team at MIT has proposed the name \"Chrysalis\".[124] The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn was formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.[125][126][127][128] The water abundance of the rings varies radially, with the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water. This abundance variance may be explained by meteor bombardment.[129]\n\n\nBeyond the main rings, at a distance of 12\u00a0million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring. It is tilted at an angle of 27\u00b0 to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.[130]\n\n\nSome of the moons of Saturn, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out.[131] Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.[132]\n\n\nIn September 2023, astronomers reported studies suggesting that the rings of Saturn may have resulted from the collision of two moons \"a few hundred million years ago\".[133][134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNatural-color mosaic of *Cassini* narrow-angle camera images of the unilluminated side of Saturn's D, C, B, A and F rings (left to right) taken on May 9, 2007 (distances are to the planet's center).\n\n## History of observation and exploration[edit]\n\n\nThe observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases: (1) pre-modern observations with the naked eye, (2) telescopic observations from Earth beginning in the 17th century, and (3) visitation by space probes, in orbit or on flyby. In the 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth (including Earth-orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope) and, until its 2017 retirement, from the *Cassini* orbiter around Saturn.\n\n\n\n### Pre-telescopic observation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Saturn (mythology) and Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Saturn\n\nSaturn has been known since prehistoric times,[135] and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn.[136] In ancient Greek, the planet was known as \u03a6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd ***Phainon***,[137] and in Roman times it was known as the \"star of Saturn\".[138] In ancient Roman mythology, the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god, from which the planet takes its modern name.[139] The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus; in modern Greek, the planet retains the name *Cronus*\u2014\u039a\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2: *Kronos*.[140]\n\n\nThe Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn's orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition.[141] In Hindu astrology, there are nine astrological objects, known as Navagrahas. Saturn is known as \"Shani\" and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life.[139][141] Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the \"earth star\" (\u571f\u661f). This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements.[142][143][144]\n\n\nIn ancient Hebrew, Saturn is called *Shabbathai*.[145] Its angel is Cassiel. Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is 'Ag\u020b\u0207l (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc, romanized:\u00a0*\u02bfAgyal*),[146] and its darker spirit (demon) is Z\u0203z\u0207l (Hebrew: \u05d6\u05d0\u05d6\u05dc, romanized:\u00a0*Zazl*).[146][147][148] Zazel has been described as a great angel, invoked in Solomonic magic, who is \"effective in love conjurations\".[149][150] In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, and Malay, the name of Zazel is 'Zuhal', derived from the Arabic language (Arabic: \u0632\u062d\u0644, romanized:\u00a0*Zuhal*).[147]\n\n\n\n### Telescopic pre-spaceflight observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei observed the rings of Saturn in 1610, but was unable to determine what they were\n![](image)Robert Hooke noted the shadows (a and b) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of Saturn in 1666.\nSaturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope[151] to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Christiaan Huygens saw them in 1655 and published about this in 1659. Galileo, with his primitive telescope in 1610,[152][153] incorrectly thought of Saturn's appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn's sides.[154][155] It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted, and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division.[156]\n\n\nNo further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when William Herschel discovered two further moons, Mimas and Enceladus. The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion, which has a resonance with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British team.[157]\n\n\nIn 1899 William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe, a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do.[157] Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it took more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere \u2013 a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.[158]\n\n\n\n### Spaceflight missions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Saturn\n\n#### *Pioneer 11* flyby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Pioneer 11* image of Saturn\n*Pioneer 11* made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000\u00a0km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at a high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, *Pioneer 11* measured the temperature of Titan.[159]\n\n\n\n#### *Voyager* flybys[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1980, the *Voyager 1* probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. *Voyager 1* performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable at visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out of the plane of the Solar System.[160]\n\n\nAlmost a year later, in August 1981, *Voyager 2* continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.[160]\n\n\nThe probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings, as well as the small Maxwell Gap (a gap within the C Ring) and Keeler gap (a 42\u00a0km-wide gap in the A Ring).\n\n\n\n#### *Cassini\u2013Huygens* spacecraft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cassini\u2013Huygens\n![](image)At Enceladus's south pole geysers spray water from many locations along the tiger stripes.[161]\nThe *Cassini\u2013Huygens* space probe entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. In June 2004, it conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. *Cassini*'s flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the *Huygens* probe on 25 December 2004. *Huygens* descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.[162]\n\n\nStarting in early 2005, scientists used *Cassini* to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately 1,000\u00a0times that of lightning on Earth.[163]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, NASA reported that *Cassini* had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus. These jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon's south polar region.[164] Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus.[161] In May 2011, NASA scientists reported that Enceladus \"is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it\".[165][166]\n\n![](image)Saturn eclipses the Sun, as seen from *Cassini*. The rings are visible, including the F Ring.\n*Cassini* photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E\u00a0rings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus.[167] In July 2006, images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, hydrocarbon seas were found near the North pole, the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea.[168] In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000\u00a0km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.[169]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2 November 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites.[170] In April 2013 *Cassini* sent back images of a hurricane at the planet's north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth, with winds faster than 530\u00a0km/h (330\u00a0mph).[171] On 15 September 2017, the *Cassini-Huygens* spacecraft performed the \"Grand Finale\" of its mission: a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[172][173] The atmospheric entry of *Cassini* ended the mission.\n\n\n\n#### Possible future missions[edit]\n\n\nThe continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included the Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe, and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus by *Dragonfly*.[174][175]\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amateur telescopic view of Saturn\nSaturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus, and occasionally 4 Vesta, are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. The mean apparent magnitude of Saturn is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.34.[23] Most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth. The brightest magnitude, \u22120.55, occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly, and the faintest magnitude, 1.17, occurs around the time when they are least inclined.[23] It takes approximately 29.4 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings in which clear resolution is present.[48][151] When Earth passes through the ring plane, which occurs twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin. Such a \"disappearance\" will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations.[176]\n\n\nSaturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, opposition, the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180\u00b0, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every year\u2014approximately every 378 days\u2014and results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits, which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next. Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible. For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth,[177] even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.[177]\n\n\nFrom time to time, Saturn is occulted by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in \"seasons\". Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a 12-month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered. The Moon's orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to Saturn's, so occultations will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points in the sky where the two planes intersect (both the length of Saturn's year and the 18.6-Earth year nodal precession period of the Moon's orbit influence the periodicity).[178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n2. **^** Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Walter, Elizabeth (21 April 2003). *Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary* (Second\u00a0ed.).

It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49\u00a0K (\u2212224\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371\u00a0\u00b0F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8\u00b0 with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. \n\n\nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900\u00a0km/h (560\u00a0mph),[22] variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \n\n\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Its ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbiting at much greater distance from Uranus are the known nine irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons.\n\n\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, it was visited up close only once when in 1986 the *Voyager\u00a02* probe flew by the planet.[23] Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023\u20132032 survey.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Position of Uranus (marked with a cross) on the date of its discovery, March 13th, 1781\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[24] Sir William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's *Almagest*.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.\n\n\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel \"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.\"[29][30]\n\n\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \"In the quartile near \u03b6 Tauri\u00a0... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\"[31] On 17 March he noted: \"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\"[32] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[29]\n\n\n\n\n> The power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\"[33]\n\n\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[34] Its nearly circular orbit led him to the conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\".[35] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet's than a comet's.[36]\n\n\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\"[37] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of \u00a3200 (equivalent to \u00a330,000 in 2023)[38] on condition that he moved to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[39]\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: \u039f\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), known as Caelus in Roman mythology, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which was rendered as *Uranus* in Latin (IPA: [\u02c8u\u02d0ran\u028as]).[2] It is the only one of the eight planets whose English name derives from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \"Uranian\".[40] The pronunciation of the name *Uranus* preferred among astronomers is /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/ *YOOR-\u0259-n\u0259s*,[1] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin *Uranus*, in contrast to /j\u028a\u02c8re\u026an\u0259s/ *yoo-RAY-n\u0259s*, with stress on the second syllable and a long *a*, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\n\n\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \"do the astronomical world the faver [*sic*] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\".[42] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object *Georgium Sidus* (George's Star), or the \"Georgian Planet\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[43] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[37]\n\n\n\n\n> In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande proposed that it be named *Herschel* in honour of its discoverer.[44] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names Astraea*,* Cybele (now the names of asteroids), and *Neptune*, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. The name was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even *Neptune George III* or *Neptune Great Britain*, a compromise Lexell suggested as well.[34][45] Daniel Bernoulli, suggested *Hypercronius* and *Transaturnis*. Georg Lichtenberg from G\u00f6ttingen suggested *Austr\u00e4a*, a goddess mentioned by Ovid (but who is traditionally associated with Virgo). The name *Minerva* was also proposed.[45]\n\n\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed *Uranus*, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[46] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[46] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[39][46][47][48] Bode was however apparently unaware that *Uranus* was only the Latinised form of the titular deity, and his Roman equivalent was Caelus. In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[49] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using *Georgium Sidus* to *Uranus*.[47]\n\n\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ![\u26e2](image),[g] was proposed by Johann Gottfried K\u00f6hler at Bode's request in 1782.[50] K\u00f6hler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no alchemical symbol for platinum, he suggested \u26e2 or \u26e2, a combination of the planetary-metal symbols \u2609 (gold) and \u2642 (iron), as platinum (or 'white gold') is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, \u26e2, fit better with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct.[50] This symbol predominates in modern astronomical use in the rare cases that symbols are used at all.[51][52] The second symbol, ![\u2645](image),[h] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"*un globe surmont\u00e9 par la premi\u00e8re lettre de votre nom*\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\").[44] The second symbol is nearly universal in astrology.\n\n\nUranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. Uranus's name is literally translated as the \"sky king star\" in Chinese (\u5929\u738b\u661f), Japanese (\u5929\u738b\u661f), Korean (\ucc9c\uc655\uc131), and Vietnamese (*sao Thi\u00ean V\u01b0\u01a1ng*).[53][54][55][56] In Thai, its official name is *Dao Yurenat* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e22\u0e39\u0e40\u0e23\u0e19\u0e31\u0e2a), as in English. Its other name in Thai is *Dao Maruettayu* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e24\u0e15\u0e22\u0e39, Star of M\u1e5btyu), after the Sanskrit word for 'death', *Mrtyu* (\u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941). In Mongolian, its name is *Tengeriin Van* (\u0422\u044d\u043d\u0433\u044d\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), translated as 'King of the Sky', reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is *Hele\u02bbekala*, the Hawaiian rendering of the name 'Herschel'.[57] In M\u0101ori, its name is *Wh\u0113rangi*.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nFor details of the evolution of Uranus's orbit, see Nice model.\n\nIt is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history.[60][61][62] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[60][61][63] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.[64] The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[60][61][65] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[60]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta Tauri twice since then, on 25\u00a0March\u00a01865 and 29\u00a0March\u00a01949. Uranus will return to this location again on 3\u00a0April\u00a02033. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20\u00a0AU (3\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 2\u00a0billion\u00a0mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[66] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[67]\n\n\nThe orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[68] With time, discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17\u00a0hours, 14\u00a0minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Simulated Earth view of Uranus from 1986 to 2030, from southern summer solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007 and northern summer solstice in 2028.\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0 (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. (Pluto and the protoplanet-asteroid 2 Pallas also have extreme axial tilts.) Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away, with only a narrow strip around the equator experiencing a rapid day\u2013night cycle, with the Sun low over the horizon. On the other side of Uranus's orbit, the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42\u00a0years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42\u00a0years of darkness.[71] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus, giving a period of day\u2013night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.\n\n\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the near-polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[72] Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4\u00a0billion years ago.[73]\nUranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of *Voyager\u00a02*'s flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \"south\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[74][75] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[76]\n\n\n\n\n\nList of solstices and equinoxes[77]\n| Northern hemisphere\n | Year\n | Southern hemisphere\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter solstice\n | 1902, 1986, 2069\n | Summer solstice\n |\n| Vernal equinox\n | 1923, 2007, 2092\n | Autumnal equinox\n |\n| Summer solstice\n | 1944, 2030\n | Winter solstice\n |\n| Autumnal equinox\n | 1965, 2050\n | Vernal equinox\n |\n\n\n### Visibility from Earth[edit]\n\n\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are 5.38 and 6.03.[18] This range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7\u00a0arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20\u00a0arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45\u00a0arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23\u00a0cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25\u00a0cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth and UranusUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27\u00a0g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3\u00a0and 13.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16][81] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7\u00a0Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[16]\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron\u2013nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[16][82] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55\u00a0Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus'; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4\u00a0Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5\u00a0Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[16][82] Uranus's core density is around 9\u00a0g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8\u00a0million\u00a0bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000\u00a0K.[81][82] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[16][82] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean.[83]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the interior of Uranus, listing each layer's composition\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[84][85] This phenomenon is similar to diamond rains that are theorised by scientists to exist on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.[86][87] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[88][89][90]\n\n\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[91]\n\n\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \"surface\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0km (15,881.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mi) and 24,973\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0km (15,518\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[22][92] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[22] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 1.06\u00b10.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[17][93] Uranus's heat flux is only 0.042\u00b10.047\u00a0W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075\u00a0W/m2.[93] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49\u00a0K (\u2212224.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371.5\u00a0\u00b0F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[94] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[16] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit upward heat transport;[17][93] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[16]\n\n\nIn a 2021 study, the ice giants' interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing minerals like olivine and ferropericlase, thus showing that large amounts of magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of Uranus and Neptune. If Uranus has more of this magnesium than Neptune, it could form a thermal insulation layer, thus potentially explaining the planet's low temperature.[95]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Uranus\n\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300\u00a0km below the 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa) and temperature of 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F).[96] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[97] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of \u2212300 and 50\u00a0km (\u2212186 and 31\u00a0mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa to 10\u00a0kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000\u00a0km (31 and 2,485\u00a0mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10\u221210\u00a0bar (10\u00a0kPa to 10\u00a0\u00b5Pa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000\u00a0km to as high as 50,000\u00a0km from the surface.[17] There is no mesosphere.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Uranus atmosphere's composition and layers, along with the graph of its pressure\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[17] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 0.15\u00b10.03[21] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 0.26\u00b10.05.[17][93] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275\u00b10.01,[98] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[17] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH4).[17] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[17] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3\u00a0bar (130\u00a0kPa); this represents about 20 to 30\u00a0times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[17][20][99]\n\n\nThe mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[100] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[17][101] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[102] They include ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), and diacetylene (C2HC2H).[100][103][104] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Troposphere[edit]\n\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[17] The temperature falls from about 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at \u2212300\u00a0km to 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) at 50\u00a0km.[96][99] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57\u00a0K (\u2212224 and \u2212216\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371 and \u2212357\u00a0\u00b0F) depending on planetary latitude.[17][92] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0K (\u2212214.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212353.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[92][93]\n\n\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100\u00a0bar (5 to 10\u00a0MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40\u00a0bar (2 to 4\u00a0MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10\u00a0bar (0.3 and 1\u00a0MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2\u00a0bar (0.1 to 0.2\u00a0MPa).[17][20][96][106] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[22]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus's upper atmosphere taken during the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program.[107]\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850\u00a0K (527 and 577\u00a0\u00b0C; 980 and 1,070\u00a0\u00b0F) at the base of the thermosphere.[97] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[108] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[102] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[108] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300\u00a0km corresponding to a pressure range of 1000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between 75 and 170\u00a0K (\u2212198 and \u2212103\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212325 and \u2212154\u00a0\u00b0F).[100][103]\n\n\nThe most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10\u22127 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[100][103][105] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[103] The abundance ratio of water is around 7\u00d710\u22129.[104] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of the stratosphere and tropopause (below 10\u00a0mBar level) forming haze layers,[102] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[100][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Planet Uranus - North Pole - Cyclone (VLA; October 2021)\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800\u00a0K (527\u00a0\u00b0C) to 850\u00a0K (577\u00a0\u00b0C).[17][109] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1\u00a0mBar pressure levels may contribute too.[97][109] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000\u00a0km (31,000\u00a0mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[97][109]\n\n\nThis extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[109] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[97] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[99] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000\u00a0km (1,200 to 6,200\u00a0mi).[99] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[109][110] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[111] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Uranus\n\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[22] When *Voyager\u00a02* flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of 10 cloud features across the entire planet.[113][114] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat is markedly lower than that of the other giant planets, as stated previously Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\n\n### Banded structure, winds and clouds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 2*'s timelapse of Uranus's dynamic atmosphere\nIn 1986, *Voyager\u00a02* found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[113] Their boundary is located at about \u221245\u00b0 of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from \u221245 to \u221250\u00b0 is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[113][115] It is called a southern \"collar\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2\u00a0bar (see above).[116] Besides the large-scale banded structure, *Voyager\u00a02* observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[113] In all other respects, Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.\n\n\n*Voyager\u00a02* arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[115] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[115] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45\u00b0 of latitude.[117] In 2023, a team employing the Very Large Array observed a dark collar at 80\u00b0 latitude, and a bright spot at the north pole, indicating the presence of a polar vortex.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first dark spot observed on Uranus. Image obtained by the HST ACS in 2006.\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably, partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[22] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[22] An early explanation\u2014that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them \u2013 was shown to be incorrect.[119][120] Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[120] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[120] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby.[22][114] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[22] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[121] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[122]\n\n\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[22] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from \u2212360 to \u2212180\u00a0km/h (\u2212220 to \u2212110\u00a0mph).[22][115] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near \u00b120\u00b0 latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[22][92] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at \u00b160\u00b0 latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[22] Wind speeds at \u221240\u00b0 latitude range from 540 to 720\u00a0km/h (340 to 450\u00a0mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[22] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860\u00a0km/h (540\u00a0mph) are observed near +50\u00b0 latitude.[22][115][123]\n\n\n\n### Seasonal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus in 2005. Rings, southern collar and a bright cloud in the northern hemisphere are visible (HST ACS image).\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[120][124] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820\u00a0km/h (510\u00a0mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \"Fourth of July fireworks\".[114] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric activity.[121] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[125][122] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere has existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[126] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[127] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[108] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry.[119]\n\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[122] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[126] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[122] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes in brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[122]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[116] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[114] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[120] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[117]\n\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[122] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[116] The bright collar at \u221245\u00b0 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[116] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[116] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[128] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[114][128]\n\n\n\n## Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The magnetic field of Uranus  \n(animated; 25 March 2020)\nBefore the arrival of *Voyager\u00a02*, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[129]\n\n\n*Voyager*'s observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59\u00b0 from the axis of rotation.[129][130] In fact, the magnetic dipole is shifted from Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one-third of the planetary radius.[129] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1\u00a0gauss (10\u00a0\u00b5T), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1\u00a0gauss (110\u00a0\u00b5T).[129] The average field at the surface is 0.23\u00a0gauss (23\u00a0\u00b5T).[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)A diagram showing Uranus's asymmetric magnetosphere\nStudies of *Voyager\u00a02* data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[131] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \"magnetic equator\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[130] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50\u00a0times that of Earth.[129][130] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[130] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water\u2013ammonia ocean.[83][132] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[89]\n\n\n\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[129][130][133] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[129][130] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[129][134]\n\n![](image)Aurorae on Uranus taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) installed on Hubble.[135]Uranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[130][133] Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[133] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2\u00a0megaelectronvolts, respectively.[133] The density of low-energy (below 1\u00a0kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2\u00a0cm\u22123.[136] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[133] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000\u00a0years.[133] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[137]\n\n\nUranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[109] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[112] In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the *Voyager\u00a02* space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Uranus\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n![](image)Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos. From left to right, they are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. (collage of *Voyager\u00a02* photographs)\n![](image)Uranus and six moons taken by the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam.\nUranus has 27 known natural satellites.[65] The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.[82][140] The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[82] The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[12] The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only 788.9\u00a0km (490.2\u00a0mi), or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[113] They are ice\u2013rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[137][141]\n\n\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest.[113][137] Miranda has fault canyons 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[113] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[142] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[143][144] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[145]\n\n\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun\u2013Uranus L3 Lagrangian point\u2014a gravitationally unstable region at 180\u00b0 in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[146][147] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit.\n2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[147]\n\n\n\n## Rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus's rings and atmosphere as imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared camera.The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[113] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the \u03b5 ring. All except the two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow \u2013 they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[137][148]\n\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[149][150] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[151] Later they detected four additional rings.[151] The rings were directly imaged when *Voyager\u00a02* passed Uranus in 1986.[113] *Voyager\u00a02* also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[152] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[153][154] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[153][155] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[153]\n\n\nAlthough the Uranian rings are very difficult to directly observe from Earth, advances in digital imaging have allowed several amateur astronomers to successfully photograph the rings with red or infrared filters; telescopes with apertures as small as 36 cm (14 inches) may be able to detect the rings with proper imaging equipment.[156]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus as seen from the *Cassini* spacecraft at Saturn\nLaunched in 1977, *Voyager\u00a02* made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500\u00a0km (50,600\u00a0mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[99] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. Voyager 2 examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[113][137][157] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[129]\n\n\nNo other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then, though there have been many proposed missions to revisit the Uranus system. The possibility of sending the *Cassini* spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere,[158] as it would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[158] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1\u20135 atmospheres.[159] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013\u20132022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisaged launch during 2020\u20132023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[159] The committee's opinion was reaffirmed in 2022, when a Uranus probe/orbiter mission was placed at the highest priority, due to the lack of knowledge about ice giants.[160]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n* In astrology, the planet Uranus (symbol ![Uranus's astrological symbol](image)) is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Because Uranus is cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the colour electric blue, which is close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius[161] (see Uranus in astrology).\n* The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, was named after the then-newly discovered Uranus.[162]\n* Lydia Sigourney included her poem ![](image) The Georgian Planet in her 1827 collection of poetry.\n* \"Uranus, the Magician\" is a movement in Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, written between 1914 and 1916.\n* Operation Uranus was the successful military operation in World War II by the Red Army to take back Stalingrad and marked the turning point in the land war against the Wehrmacht.\n* The lines \"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/When a new planet swims into his ken\", from John Keats's \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", are a reference to Herschel's discovery of Uranus.[163]\n* In English language popular culture, humor is often derived from the common pronunciation of Uranus' name, which resembles that of the phrase \"your anus\".[164]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 QF99 and 2014 YX49, the only two known Uranus trojans\n* Colonisation of Uranus\n* Extraterrestrial diamonds (thought to be abundant in Uranus)\n* Outline of Uranus\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n* Uranus in astrology\n* Uranus in fiction\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  These are the mean elements from VSOP87, together with derived quantities.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g***  Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n3. **^**  Calculated using data from Seidelmann, 2007.[11]\n4. **^**  Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n5. **^**  Calculation of He, H2 and CH4 molar fractions is based on a 2.3% mixing ratio of methane to hydrogen and the 15/85 He/H2 proportions measured at the tropopause.\n6. **^**  Because, in the English-speaking world, the latter sounds like \"your anus\", the former pronunciation also saves embarrassment: as Pamela Gay, an astronomer at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, noted on her podcast, to avoid \"being made fun of by any small schoolchildren\u00a0... when in doubt, don't emphasise anything and just say /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/.

In my view, it is necessary to follow the mythology in this election, which had been borrowed from the ancient name of the other planets; because in the series of previously known, perceived by a strange person or event of modern times name of a planet would very noticeable. Diodorus of Cilicia tells the story of Atlas, an ancient people that inhabited one of the most fertile areas in Africa, and looked at the sea shores of his country as the homeland of the gods. Uranus was her first king, founder of their civilized life and inventor of many useful arts. At the same time he is also described as a diligent and skilful astronomers of antiquity ... even more: Uranus was the father of Saturn and the Atlas, as the former is the father of Jupiter.\n> \n>\n47. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nLittmann, Mark (2004). *Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System*.

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17\u00a0times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8\u00a0years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5\u00a0billion kilometres; 2.8\u00a0billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ![\u2646](image), representing Neptune's trident.[d]\n\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23\u00a0September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th\u00a0century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by *Voyager\u00a02*, when it flew by the planet on 25\u00a0August 1989; *Voyager\u00a02* remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[18][19] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.\n\n\nLike the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of *ices* such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[20] both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them.[21] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[22] The blue colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to the thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.[23][24][25]\n\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100\u00a0km/h (580\u00a0m/s; 1,300\u00a0mph).[27] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55\u00a0K (\u2212218\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212361\u00a0\u00b0F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400\u00a0K (5,100\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,300\u00a0\u00b0F).[28][29] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by *Voyager 2*.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei\nSome of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo Galilei's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match with what is now known to have been the positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close\u2014in conjunction\u2014to Jupiter in the night sky.[31] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[32] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least aware that the \"star\" he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars.[33]\n\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[34] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[35] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February\u00a01844. Adams continued to work in 1845\u20131846 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Urbain Le Verrier\nIn 1845\u20131846, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June\u00a01846, upon seeing Le\u00a0Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.[35][38] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, Johann Gottfried Galle, and on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[39][35][40]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Le\u00a0Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le\u00a0Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23\u00a0September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1\u00b0 from the \"*five degrees east of Delta Capricorn*\" position Le\u00a0Verrier had predicted it to be,[41][42] about 12\u00b0 from Adams's prediction, and on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.\n\n\nIn the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le\u00a0Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nShortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le\u00a0Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name *Janus*. In England, Challis put forward the name *Oceanus*.[45]\n\n\nClaiming the right to name his discovery, Le\u00a0Verrier quickly proposed the name *Neptune* for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.[46] In October, he sought to name the planet *Le\u00a0Verrier*, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, Fran\u00e7ois Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France.[47] French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name *Herschel* for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir\u00a0William Herschel, and *Leverrier* for the new planet.[48]\n\n\nStruve came out in favour of the name *Neptune* on 29\u00a0December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences,[49] after the colour of the planet as viewed through a telescope.[50] Soon, *Neptune* became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.[e][51]\n\n\nMost languages today use some variant of the name \"Neptune\" for the planet; indeed, in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"sea king star\" (\u6d77\u738b\u661f).[52][53] In Mongolian, Neptune is called *Dalain van* (\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called *Poseidon* (\u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, *Poseidonas*), the Greek counterpart of Neptune.[54] In Hebrew, *Rahab* (\u05e8\u05d4\u05d1), from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms, was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing Latin term *Neptun* (\u05e0\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05df) is commonly used.[55][56] In M\u0101ori, the planet is called *Tangaroa*, named after the M\u0101ori god of the sea.[57] In Nahuatl, the planet is called *Tl\u0101locc\u012btlalli*, named after the rain god Tl\u0101loc.[57] In Thai, Neptune is referred to by its Westernised name *Dao Nepchun/Nepjun* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e08\u0e39\u0e19), but is also called *Dao Ket* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e01\u0e15\u0e38, lit.\u2009'star of Ketu'), after Ketu (\u0915\u0947\u0924\u0941), the descending lunar node, who plays a role in Hindu astrology. In Malay, the name *Waruna*, after the Hindu god of seas, is attested as far back as the 1970s,[58] but was eventually superseded by the Latinate equivalents *Neptun* (in Malaysian[59]) or *Neptunus* (in Indonesian[60]).\n\n\nThe usual adjectival form is *Neptunian*. The nonce form *Poseidean* (/p\u0259\u02c8sa\u026adi\u0259n/), from Poseidon, has also been used,[4] though the usual adjectival form of Poseidon is *Poseidonian* (/\u02ccp\u0252sa\u026a\u02c8do\u028ani\u0259n/).[61]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nFrom its discovery in 1846 until the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer than Neptune to the Sun, making Neptune the ninth planet from the Sun during this period.[62][63] The increasingly accurate estimations of Pluto's mass from ten times that of Earth's to far less than that of the Moon[64] and the discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[65][66] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[67]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A size comparison of Neptune and Earth\nNeptune's mass of 1.0243\u00d71026\u00a0kg[7] is intermediate between Earth and the larger gas giants: it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter.[f] Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15\u00a0m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth,[68] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[69] Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764\u00a0km[10] is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\nNeptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core. Pressure in the atmosphere reaches about 10\u00a0GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physical and chemical composition of Neptune's interior\nThe mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane.[1] As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid (supercritical fluid). This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean.[72] The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.[73] At a depth of 7,000\u00a0km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones.[74][75][76] Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[77][75] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.[78][79][80]\n\n\nThe core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth.[81] The pressure at the centre is 7\u00a0Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400\u00a0K.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combined colour and near-infrared image of Neptune, showing bands of methane in its atmosphere, and four of its moons, Proteus, Larissa, Galatea, and Despina\nA time-lapse video of Neptune and its moons\nAt high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.[28] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600\u00a0nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neptune - cloud cover over three decades (1994-2023)[84]\nNeptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10\u00a0kPa).[21] The stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10\u22125 to 10\u22124 bars (1 to 10\u00a0Pa).[21] The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck.\nModels suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude.[84] The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0\u00a0MPa), where the temperature reaches 273\u00a0K (0\u00a0\u00b0C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.[85]\n\n\nHigh-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitudes. These circumferential bands have widths of 50\u2013150\u00a0km and lie about 50\u2013110\u00a0km above the cloud deck.[86] These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. In August 2023, the clouds of Neptune vanished, possibly due to \"solar flare\".[84] Thirty years of observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes showed that Neptune's cloud activity is bound to Solar cycles, and not to the planet's seasons.[87][88]\n\n\nNeptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne.[21][28] The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.[21][89] The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.[21]\n\n\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750\u00a0K.[90][91] The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.[85][89]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nNeptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47\u00b0 and offset at least 0.55\u00a0radius, or about 13,500\u00a0km from the planet's physical centre. Before *Voyager 2*'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[85] resulting in a dynamo action.[92]\n\n\nThe dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14\u00a0microteslas (0.14\u00a0G).[93] The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017\u00a0T\u00b7m3 (14\u00a0\u03bcT\u00b7*R**N*3, where *R**N* is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of an offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.[94][95]\n\n\nMeasurements by *Voyager 2* in extreme-ultraviolet and radio frequencies revealed that Neptune has faint and weak but complex and unique aurorae; however, these observations were limited in time and did not contain infrared. Subsequent astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have not glimpsed the aurorae, in contrast to the more well-defined aurorae of Uranus.[96][97]\n\n\nNeptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23\u201326.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.[94]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud),[98] and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated.\nNeptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600\u00a0m/s (2,200\u00a0km/h; 1,300\u00a0mph)\u2014exceeding supersonic flow.[27] More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20\u00a0m/s in the easterly direction to 325\u00a0m/s westward.[99] At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400\u00a0m/s along the equator to 250\u00a0m/s at the poles.[85] Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.[100] The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a \"skin effect\" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.[21] At 70\u00b0 S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300\u00a0m/s.[21]\n\n\nNeptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. *Voyager 2* observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby,[101] but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.\n\n\nThe abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10\u2013100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.[21]\n\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73\u00a0K (\u2212200\u00a0\u00b0C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole.[102] The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.[103]\n\n\nBecause of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.[104]\n\n\n\n### Storms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a06,600\u00a0km (8,100\u00a0mi \u00d7\u00a04,100\u00a0mi)[101] was discovered by NASA's *Voyager 2* spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.[105]\n\n\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the *Voyager 2* encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by *Voyager 2*).[100] The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as *Voyager 2* approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.[106] In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] In 2023, the first ground-based observation of a dark spot on Neptune was announced.[107]\n\n\nNeptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features,[108] so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.[86] Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer.[109] The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other, unknown mechanism.[110]\n\n\n\n* ![The appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]](image)\n\nThe appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]\n* ![The Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]](image)\n\nThe Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]\n* ![The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2](image)\n\nThe Great Dark Spot in a color-uncalibrated image by *Voyager 2.*\n* ![Neptune's shrinking vortex[113]](image)\n\nNeptune's shrinking vortex[113]\n\n\n### Internal heating[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Four images taken a few hours apart with the NASA/ESA *Hubble Space Telescope*'s Wide Field Camera 3. Near infrared radiation data has been used as red channel.[114]\nNeptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8\u00a0K (\u2212221.3\u00a0\u00b0C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa), the temperature is 72.00\u00a0K (\u2212201.15\u00a0\u00b0C).[115] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun;[116] whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.[117] Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% of its amount of sunlight,[21] yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.[118]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neptune (red arc) completes one orbit around the Sun (centre) for every 164.79 orbits of Earth. The light blue object represents Uranus.\nThe average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.5 billion km (about 30.1\u00a0astronomical units (AU)), and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79\u00a0years, subject to a variability of around \u00b10.1\u00a0years. The perihelion distance is 29.81\u00a0AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33\u00a0AU.[g]\n\n\nOn 11\u00a0July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846,[120] although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26\u00a0day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.[11][121][122]\n\n\nThe elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77\u00b0 compared to that of Earth.\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32\u00b0,[123] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23\u00b0) and Mars (25\u00b0). As a result, Neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[104] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11\u00a0hours.[11] Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.\n\n\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18\u00a0hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12\u00a0hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,[124] and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.[86]\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital resonances[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kuiper belt, resonant trans-Neptunian object, and Neptune trojan\n\n![](image)A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant \"classical belt\" (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos).\nNeptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30\u00a0AU out to about 55\u00a0AU from the Sun.[125] Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in its structure. The region between 40 and 42\u00a0AU is an example.[126]\n\n\nThere do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects,[127] is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them.[128] Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.[129] The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.[130]\n\n\nNeptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the Sun\u2013Neptune L4 and L5 Lagrangian points\u2014gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in its orbit, respectively.[131] Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured. The first object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing L5 Lagrangian point was 2008 LC18.[132] Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite, (309239) 2007 RW10.[133] The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years.[133]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Nice model\n\n![](image)A simulation showing the outer planets and Kuiper belt: a) before Jupiter and Saturn reached a 2:1 resonance; b) after inward scattering of Kuiper belt objects following the orbital shift of Neptune; c) after ejection of scattered Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter\nThe formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.[70]\n\n\nAn alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.[134] This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.[135] The current most widely accepted[136][137][138] explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.\n\n\n\n## Moons and rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Neptune\n\nFor a timeline of discovery dates, see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons.\n\n![Shown in this image are Neptune and its moons: Triton, Galatea, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Proteus, and Larissa](image)An annotated picture of Neptune's many moons as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. The bright blue diffraction star is Triton, Neptune's largest moon.\nNeptune has 14 known moons.[7][139] Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[h] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17\u00a0days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.[140] It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6\u00a0billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.[141] In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System,[142] with estimated temperatures of 38\u00a0K (\u2212235\u00a0\u00b0C).[143]\n\n\nNeptune's second-known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.[i]\n\n\nFrom July to September 1989, *Voyager 2* discovered six moons of Neptune.[144] Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity.[145] Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons\u2014Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea\u2014orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when *Voyager 2* observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.[146][147] A new moon and the smallest yet, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images.[148] Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Neptune\n\n![](image)Neptune's rings and moons viewed in infrared by the James Webb Space Telescope\nNeptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn.[149] The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.[150] The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000\u00a0km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000\u00a0km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000\u00a0km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000\u00a0km.[151]\n\n\nThe first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan.[30][152] In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.[153]\nEvidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion.[154] Images from *Voyager 2* in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.\n\n\nThe outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named *Courage*, *Libert\u00e9*, *Egalit\u00e9\u00a01*, *Egalit\u00e9\u00a02* and *Fraternit\u00e9* (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).[155] The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.[156][157]\n\n\nEarth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings were much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by *Voyager 2*. In particular, it seems that the *Libert\u00e9* arc might disappear in as little as one century.[158]\n\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Movement of Neptune in front of the stars of Aquarius in 2022\n![Neptune visible in the night sky](image)In 2018, the European Southern Observatory used adaptive optics to get clear and high-resolution images of Neptune from the surface of Earth.\nNeptune brightened about 10% between 1980 and 2000 mostly due to the changing of the seasons.[159] Neptune may continue to brighten as it approaches perihelion in 2042. The apparent magnitude currently ranges from 7.67 to 7.89 with a mean of 7.78 and a standard deviation of 0.06.[15] Prior to 1980, the planet was as faint as magnitude 8.0.[15] Neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. It can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe.[160] A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.[161]\n\n\nBecause of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4\u00a0arcseconds,[7][17] the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).[162][163][164] The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[165] Neptune is currently approaching perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both *Hubble* and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.[166]\n\n\nFrom Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367\u00a0days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[122]\n\n\nNeptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[41]\n\n\nObservation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field.[85] In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.[167]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Neptune\n\n![](image)A *Voyager 2* mosaic of Triton\n*Voyager 2* is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft's closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for *Voyager 1*'s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from *Voyager 2* became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, *Neptune All Night*.[168]\n\n\nDuring the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246\u00a0minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, *Voyager 2*'s mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400\u00a0km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.[169]\n\n\nThe spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and *Voyager 2* also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.[144][169]\n\n\nThe flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which was found to be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered Planet X acted upon the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.[170][171]\n\n\nSince 2018, the China National Space Administration has been studying a concept for a pair of *Voyager*-like interstellar probes tentatively known as *Interstellar Express* or *Interstellar Heliosphere Probe*.[172] Both probes will be launched at the same time in 2024 and take differing paths to explore opposing ends of the heliosphere; the second probe, *IHP-2*, will fly by Neptune in January 2038, passing only 1,000\u00a0km above the cloud tops, and potentially carry an atmospheric impactor to be released during its approach.[173] Afterward, it will continue on its mission throughout the Kuiper belt toward the tail of the heliosphere, so far unexplored.\n\n\nAfter *Voyager 2* and *IHP-2*'s flybys, the next step in scientific exploration of the Neptunian system is considered to be an orbital mission; most proposals have been by NASA, most often for a Flagship orbiter.[174] Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s.[174] However, there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's \"Vision Missions Studies\" for a \"Neptune Orbiter with Probes\" mission that does *Cassini*-level science.[175] A subsequent proposal was for *Argo*, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019, that would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object. The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around 2029.[176] The proposed *New Horizons 2* mission (which was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system. Currently a pending proposal for the Discovery program, *Trident* would conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton;[177] however, the mission was not selected for Discovery 15 or 16. *Neptune Odyssey* is the current mission concept for a Neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe being studied as a possible large strategic science mission by NASA that would launch between 2031 and 2033, and arrive at Neptune by 2049.[178]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Neptune\n* Hot Neptune\n* Neptune in astrology\n* Neptunium\n* *Neptune, the Mystic* \u2013 one of the seven movements in Gustav Holst's *Planets* suite\n* Timeline of the far future\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Orbital elements refer to the Neptune barycentre and Solar System barycentre.

Following the right-hand rule for prograde rotation puts Ishtar Terra in the negative hemisphere and makes the axial tilt 177.36\u00b0.\n |\n\n\n**Venus** is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a \"morning star\" or an \"evening star\". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,[20][21] appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.\n\n\nVenus has a weak induced magnetosphere and an especially thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, which creates, together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover, an extreme greenhouse effect. This results at the surface in a mean temperature of 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid, while at cloudy altitudes of 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) above the surface, the pressure, temperature and also radiation are very much like at Earth's surface. Conditions possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, with recent research having found indicative, but not convincing, evidence of life on the planet. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history, possibly enough to form oceans, but runaway greenhouse effects eventually evaporated any water, which then was taken into space by the solar wind.[22][23][24] Internally, Venus is thought to consist of a core,\u00a0mantle, and\u00a0crust, the latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shaping the surface with large resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System which have no moons.[25] Nonetheless, studies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics during ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\nVenus has a rotation which has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the strong currents and drag of its atmosphere. This rotation produces, together with the time of 224.7 Earth days it takes Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun (a Venusian solar year), a Venusian solar day length of 117 Earth days, resulting in a Venusian year being just under two Venusian days long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. While this allows them to come closer to each other at inferior conjunction than any other pair of Solar System planets, Mercury stays on average closer to them and any other planet, as Mercury is the most central planet and passes by most frequently.[28] That said, Venus and Earth between them have the lowest difference in gravitational potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This has allowed Venus to be the most accessible destination and attractive gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights.\n\n\nIn 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight in human history, followed by many essential interplanetary firsts like the first soft landing on another planet in 1970. These probes made it evident that extreme greenhouse effects have created oppressive surface conditions, an insight that has crucially informed predictions about global warming on Earth.[29][30] This finding stopped most attention towards theories and the then popular science fiction about Venus being a habitable or inhabited planet. Crewed flights to Venus have been suggested nevertheless, either to flyby Venus, performing a gravity assist for reaching Mars faster and safer, or to enter the Venusian atmosphere and stay aloft at altitudes with conditions more comparable to Earth's surface, except atmospheric composition, than anywhere else in the Solar System. Contemporarily, Venus has again gained interest as a case for research into particularly the development of Earth-like planets and their habitability.\n\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Venus to scale among the terrestrial planets of the Solar System, which are arranged by the order of their Inner Solar System orbits outward from the Sun (from left: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars)\nVenus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\".[31] Venus is close to spherical due to its slow rotation.[32] Venus has a diameter of 12,103.6\u00a0km (7,520.8\u00a0mi)\u2014only 638.4\u00a0km (396.7\u00a0mi) less than Earth's\u2014and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[33] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Venus\n\n![The atmosphere of Venus appears darker and lined with shadows. The shadows trace the prevailing wind direction.](image)Cloud structure of the Venusian atmosphere, made visible through ultraviolet imaging\nVenus has a dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen\u2014both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface with a 6.5% density of water\u2014[34] and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide.[35] The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's\u2014a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1\u00a0km (5\u20448\u00a0mi) under Earth's oceans. The density at the surface is 65\u00a0kg/m3 (4.1\u00a0lb/cu\u00a0ft), 6.5% that of water[34] or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293\u00a0K (20\u00a0\u00b0C; 68\u00a0\u00b0F) at sea level. The CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 735\u00a0K (462\u00a0\u00b0C; 864\u00a0\u00b0F).[36][37] This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) and maximum surface temperature of 700\u00a0K (427\u00a0\u00b0C; 801\u00a0\u00b0F),[38][39] even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance. Because of its runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has been identified by scientists such as Carl Sagan as a warning and research object linked to climate change on Earth.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\nVenus Temperature[40]\n| Type | SurfaceTemperature\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Maximum | 900\u00a0\u00b0F (482\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n| Normal | 847\u00a0\u00b0F (453\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n| Minimum | 820\u00a0\u00b0F (438\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n\n\nVenus's atmosphere is rich in primordial noble gases compared to that of Earth.[41] This enrichment indicates an early divergence from Earth in evolution. An unusually large comet impact[42] or accretion of a more massive primary atmosphere from solar nebula[43] have been proposed to explain the enrichment. However, the atmosphere is depleted of radiogenic argon, a proxy for mantle degassing, suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism.[44][45]\n\n\nStudies have suggested that billions of years ago, Venus's atmosphere could have been much more like the one surrounding the early Earth, and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface.[46][47][48] After a period of 600 million to several billion years,[49] solar forcing from rising luminosity of the Sun and possibly large volcanic resurfacing caused the evaporation of the original water and the current atmosphere.[50] A runaway greenhouse effect was created once a critical level of greenhouse gases (including water) was added to its atmosphere.[51] Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earth-like life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of Venus, 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) up from the surface, where the atmospheric conditions are the most Earth-like in the Solar System,[52] with temperatures ranging between 303 and 353\u00a0K (30 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C; 86 and 176\u00a0\u00b0F), and the pressure and radiation being about the same as at Earth's surface, but with acidic clouds and the carbon dioxide air.[53][54][55] The putative detection of an absorption line of phosphine in Venus's atmosphere, with no known pathway for abiotic production, led to speculation in September 2020 that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere.[56][57] Later research attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide,[58] or found that in fact there was no absorption line.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Types of cloud layers, as well as temperature and pressure change by altitude in the atmosphere\nThermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the planet's two hemispheres, those facing and not facing the Sun, despite Venus's slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even without the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen.[61]\n\n\nAbove the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds, consisting mainly of sulfuric acid, which is formed by sulfur dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate. Additionally, the clouds consist of approximately 1% ferric chloride.[62][63] Other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions.[62] These clouds reflect, similar to thick cloud cover on Earth,[64] about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space,[65] and since they cover the whole planet they prevent visual observation of Venus's surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground, with only 10% of the received sunlight reaching the surface,[66] resulting in average daytime levels of illumination at the surface of 14,000 lux, comparable to that on Earth \"in the daytime with overcast clouds\".[67] Strong 300\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.[68] Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10\u201320% rotation speed.[69]\n\n\nThe surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[4][70] Venus's minute axial tilt\u2014less than 3\u00b0, compared to 23\u00b0 on Earth\u2014also minimises seasonal temperature variation.[71] Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian temperatures. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about 655\u00a0K (380\u00a0\u00b0C; 715\u00a0\u00b0F) and an atmospheric pressure of about 4.5\u00a0MPa (45\u00a0bar).[72][73] In 1995, the *Magellan* spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks, a \"Venus snow\" that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena).[74]\n\n\nAlthough Venus has no seasons, in 2019, astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere, possibly caused by opaque, absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds. The variation causes observed changes in the speed of Venus's zonal winds and appears to rise and fall in time with the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.[75]\n\n\nThe existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial[76] since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes.[77][78][79] In 2006\u201307, *Venus Express* clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least half that on Earth,[80] however other instruments have not detected lightning at all.[76] The origin of any lightning remains unclear, but could originate from clouds or Venusian volcanoes.\n\n\nIn 2007, *Venus Express* discovered that a huge double atmospheric polar vortex exists at the south pole.[81][82] *Venus Express* discovered, in 2011, that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of Venus.[83] On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to \"the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\"[84][85]\n\n\nIn December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's *Akatsuki* mission observed bow shaped objects in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system.[86][87][88]\n\n\n\n### Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geology of Venus, Geodynamics of Venus, Mapping of Venus, and Surface features of Venus\n\n![](image)Color-coded elevation map, showing the elevated terrae \"continents\" in yellow and minor features of Venus.\nThe Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. *Venera* landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks.[89] The surface was mapped in detail by *Magellan* in 1990\u201391. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been recent eruptions.[90][91]\n\n\nAbout 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains.[92] Two highland \"continents\" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) above the Venusian average surface elevation.[93] The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek mythological goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.[94]\n\n\nThe absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma. The planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, at 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][96] Venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called \"farra\", which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50\u00a0km (12 to 31\u00a0mi) across, and from 100 to 1,000\u00a0m (330 to 3,280\u00a0ft) high; radial, star-like fracture systems called \"novae\"; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as \"arachnoids\"; and \"coronae\", circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.[97]\n\n\nMost Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women.[98] Exceptions are Maxwell Montes, named after James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Ovda Regio. The last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International Astronomical Union, the body which oversees planetary nomenclature.[99]\n\n\nThe longitude of physical features on Venus is expressed relative to its prime meridian. The original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature Eve, located south of Alpha Regio.[100] After the Venera missions were completed, the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater Ariadne on Sedna Planitia.[101][102]\n\n\nThe stratigraphically oldest tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding basaltic plains measured by *Venus Express* and *Magellan*, indicating a different, possibly a more felsic, mineral assemblage.[23][103] The mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the presence of water ocean and plate tectonics, implying that habitable condition had existed on early Venus with large bodies of water at some point.[104] However, the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain.[105]\n\n\nStudies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest that Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics durng ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)180-degree panorama of Venus's surface from the Soviet *Venera 9* lander, 1975. Black-and-white image of barren, black, slate-like rocks against a flat sky. The ground and the probe are the focus.\n#### Volcanism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanism on Venus\n\n![](image)Radar mosaic of two 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) wide (and less than 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) high) pancake domes in Venus's Eistla region\nMuch of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.[97]:\u200a154 More than 85,000 volcanoes on Venus were identified and mapped.[106][107] This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject to the same erosion process. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years,[108] whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][97]\n\n\nSeveral lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. Sulfur dioxide concentrations in the upper atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold.[109] This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.[110][111] It has been suggested that Venusian lightning (discussed below) could originate from volcanic activity (i.e. volcanic lightning). In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence that suggests that Venus is currently volcanically active, specifically the detection of olivine, a volcanic product that would weather quickly on the planet's surface.[112][113]\n\n\nThis massive volcanic activity is fueled by a superheated interior, which models say could be explained by energetic collisions from when the planet was young. Impacts would have had significantly higher velocity than on Earth, both because Venus' orbit is faster due to its closer proximity to the Sun and because objects would require higher orbital eccentricities to collide with the planet.[114]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by *Venus Express*, in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone Ganis Chasma,[115][note 1] near the shield volcano Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions.[116][117] The actual temperatures are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured, but are likely to have been in the 800\u20131,100\u00a0K (527\u2013827\u00a0\u00b0C; 980\u20131,520\u00a0\u00b0F) range, relative to a normal temperature of 740\u00a0K (467\u00a0\u00b0C; 872\u00a0\u00b0F).[118] In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the *Magellan* orbiter. Using computer simulations, they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Craters[edit]\n\n\n![The plains of Venus](image)Impact craters on the surface of Venus (false-colour image reconstructed from radar data)\nAlmost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event 300\u2013600\u00a0million years ago,[95][96] followed by a decay in volcanism.[120] Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100\u00a0million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.[97]\n\n\nVenusian craters range from 3 to 280\u00a0km (2 to 174\u00a0mi) in diameter. No craters are smaller than 3\u00a0km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.[121] Incoming projectiles less than 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.[122]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![Spherical cross-section of Venus showing the different layers](image)The differentiated structure of Venus\nWithout data from reflection seismology or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus.[123] The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate,[124] although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[125] The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[126] The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900\u20133,450\u00a0km.[125] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500\u00a0km.[127]\n\n\nThe principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.[128] Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.[95]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field and core[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, *Venera 4* found Venus's magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind,[129][130][*page\u00a0needed*] rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against solar and cosmic radiation, reaching at elevations of 54 to 48 km Earth-like levels.[131][132]\n\n\nThe lack of an intrinsic magnetic field on Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size and was expected to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo.[133][134] This implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is reheating the crust.[135]\n\n\nOne possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,[136] or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its core has already been completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.[135]\n\n\nAnother possibility is that the absence of a late, large impact on Venus (*contra* the Earth's \"Moon-forming\" impact) left the core of Venus stratified from the core's incremental formation, and without the forces to initiate/sustain convection, and thus a \"geodynamo\".[137]\n\n\nThe weak magnetosphere around Venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of water molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed.[138] However, the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first 2\u20133 billion years, so the water loss may have occurred more recently.[139] The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.[140]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit of Venus\n\n![Mars circling the Sun further and slower than Earth](image)Venus is the second planet from the Sun, making a full orbit in about 224 days\nVenus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72\u00a0AU (108\u00a0million\u00a0km; 67\u00a0million\u00a0mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.[4] Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting early climate evolution.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Venus and its rotation in respect to its revolution.\nAll planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets rotate on their axes in an anticlockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days\u2014the slowest rotation of any planet. This Venusian sidereal day lasts therefore longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Slowed by its strong atmospheric current the length of the day also fluctuates by up to 20 minutes.[142] Venus's equator rotates at 6.52\u00a0km/h (4.05\u00a0mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4\u00a0km/h (1,040.4\u00a0mph).[note 2][146] Venus's rotation period measured with *Magellan* spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and *Venus Express* visits, with a difference of about 6.5\u00a0minutes.[147] Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days \u2014 the 116-day figure is close to the average number of days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its orbit).[11] One Venusian year is about 1.92\u00a0Venusian solar days.[148] To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east,[148] although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.[149]\n\n\nVenus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.[150][151] The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5\u00a0Venusian solar days (5.001444 to be precise),[152] but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.[153]\n\n\nVenus has no natural satellites.[154] It has several trojan asteroids: the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68[155][156] and two other temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133.[157] In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following 200\u00a0years, but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.[158] About 10\u00a0million\u00a0years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and the resulting Tidal deceleration caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.[159] If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.[154]\n\n\nThe orbital space of Venus has a dust ring-cloud,[160] with a suspected origin either from Venus\u2013trailing asteroids,[161] interplanetary dust migrating in waves, or the remains of the Solar System's original circumstellar disc that formed the planetary system.[162]\n\n\n\n### Orbit in respect to Earth[edit]\n\n\n![A complex, spiral, floral pattern with five loops encircling the middle](image)Earth is positioned at the centre of the diagram, and the curve represents the direction and distance of Venus as a function of time.\nEarth and Venus have a near orbital resonance of 13:8 (Earth orbits eight times for every 13 orbits of Venus).[163]\nTherefore they approach each other and reach inferior conjunction in synodic periods of 584 days, on average.[4] The path that Venus makes in relation to Earth viewed geocentrically draws a pentagram over five synodic periods, shifting every period by 144\u00b0. This pentagram of Venus is sometimes referred to as the petals of Venus due to the path's visual similarity to a flower.[164]\n\n\nWhen Venus lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of 41\u00a0million\u00a0km (25\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[4][note 3][165]\nBecause of the decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year\u00a01 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40\u00a0million\u00a0km (25\u00a0million\u00a0mi); then, there are none for about 60,158 years.[166]\n\n\nWhile Venus approaches Earth the closest, Mercury is more often the closest to Earth of all planets.[167] Venus has the lowest gravitational potential difference to Earth than any other planet, needing the lowest delta-v to transfer between them.[168][169]\n\n\nTidally Venus exerts the third strongest tidal force on Earth, after the Moon and the Sun, though significantly less.[170]\n\n\n\n## Observability[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of the night sky taken from the seashore. A glimmer of sunlight is on the horizon. There are many stars visible. Venus is at the centre, much brighter than any of the stars, and its light can be seen reflected in the ocean.](image)Venus, pictured center-right, is always brighter than all other planets or stars at their maximal brightness, as seen from Earth. Jupiter is visible at the top of the image.\nTo the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).[171] The planet's mean apparent magnitude is \u22124.14 with a standard deviation of 0.31.[18] The brightest magnitude occurs during the crescent phase about one month before or after an inferior conjunction. Venus fades to about magnitude \u22123 when it is backlit by the Sun.[172] The planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight,[173] but is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47\u00b0 of the Sun.[174]\n\n\nVenus \"overtakes\" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun.[4] As it does so, it changes from the \"Evening Star\", visible after sunset, to the \"Morning Star\", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, the other inferior planet, reaches a maximum elongation of only 28\u00b0 and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported \"unidentified flying object\".[175]\n\n\n\n### Phases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phases of Venus\n\n![Diagram illustrating the phases of Venus](image)The phases of Venus and evolution of its apparent diameter\nAs it orbits the Sun, Venus displays phases like those of the Moon in a telescopic view. The planet appears as a small and \"full\" disc when it is on the opposite side of the Sun (at superior conjunction). Venus shows a larger disc and \"quarter phase\" at its maximum elongations from the Sun, and appears at its brightest in the night sky. The planet presents a much larger thin \"crescent\" in telescopic views as it passes along the near side between Earth and the Sun. Venus displays its largest size and \"new phase\" when it is between Earth and the Sun (at inferior conjunction). Its atmosphere is visible through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around it.[174] The phases are clearly visible in a 4\" telescope.[*citation needed*] Although naked eye visibility of Venus's phases is disputed, records exist of observations of its crescent.[176]\n\n\n\n### Daylight apparitions[edit]\n\n\nWhen Venus is sufficiently bright with enough angular distance from the sun, it is easily observed in a clear daytime sky with the naked eye.[177] Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its appearance in the daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg.[178] Another historical daytime observation of the planet took place during the inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4\u00a0March 1865.[179]\n\n\n\n### Transits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transit of Venus\n\n![White disk with a small black dot projected on a screen](image)2012 transit of Venus, projected to a white card by a telescope\nA transit of Venus is the appearance of Venus in front of the Sun, during inferior conjunction. Since the orbit of Venus is slightly inclined relative to Earth's orbit, most inferior conjunctions with Earth, which occur every synodic period of 1.6 years, do not produce a transit of Venus above Earth. Consequently Venus transits above Earth only occur when an inferior conjunction takes place during some days of June or December, the time where the orbits of Venus and Earth cross a straight line with the Sun.[180] This results in Venus transiting above Earth in a sequence of currently 8\u00a0years, 105.5\u00a0years, 8\u00a0years and 121.5\u00a0years, forming cycles of 243\u00a0years.\n\n\nHistorically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Jeremiah Horrocks in 1639 with the first known observation of a Venus transit (after history's first observed planetary transit in 1631, of Mercury).[181]\n\n\nOnly seven Venus transits have been observed so far, since their occurrences were calculated in the 1621 by Johannes Kepler. Captain Cook sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to record the third observed transit of Venus, which subsequently resulted in the exploration of the east coast of Australia.[182][183]\n\n\nThe latest pair was June 8, 2004 and June 5\u20136, 2012. The transit could be watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right equipment and conditions.[184] The preceding pair of transits occurred in December 1874 and December 1882.\n\n\nThe next transit will occur in December 2117 and December 2125.[185]\n\n\n\n### Ashen light[edit]\n\n\nA long-standing mystery of Venus observations is the so-called ashen light\u2014an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.[186][78] The ashen light has often been sighted when Venus is in the evening sky, when the evening terminator of the planet is towards Earth.\n\n\n\n## Observation and exploration history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Observations and explorations of Venus\n\n### Early observation[edit]\n\n\nVenus is in Earth's sky bright enough to be visible without aid, making it one of the star-like classical planets that human cultures have known and identified throughout history, particularly for being the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Sun and the Moon. Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as a single entity;[187] instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star.[187] Nonetheless, a cylinder seal from the Jemdet Nasr period and the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa from the First Babylonian dynasty indicate that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.[188][187][189] In the Old Babylonian period, the planet Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat.[190] The name \"Ninsi'anna\" translates to \"divine lady, illumination of heaven\", which refers to Venus as the brightest visible \"star\". Earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign si4 (= SU, meaning \"to be red\"), and the original meaning may have been \"divine lady of the redness of heaven\", in reference to the colour of the morning and evening sky.[191]\n\n\nThe Chinese historically referred to the morning Venus as \"the Great White\" (*T\u00e0ib\u00e1i* \u592a\u767d) or \"the Opener (Starter) of Brightness\" (*Q\u01d0m\u00edng* \u555f\u660e), and the evening Venus as \"the Excellent West One\" (*Ch\u00e1ngg\u0113ng* \u9577\u5e9a).[192]\n\n\nThe ancient Greeks initially believed Venus to be two separate stars: Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star. Pliny the Elder credited the realization that they were a single object to Pythagoras in the sixth century BC,[193] while Diogenes La\u00ebrtius argued that Parmenides (early fifth century) was probably responsible for this discovery.[194] Though they recognized Venus as a single object, the ancient Romans continued to designate the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer, literally \"Light-Bringer\", and the evening aspect as Vesper,[195] both of which are literal translations of their traditional Greek names.\n\n\nIn the second century, in his astronomical treatise *Almagest*, Ptolemy theorized that both Mercury and Venus were located between the Sun and the Earth. The 11th-century Persian astronomer Avicenna claimed to have observed a transit of Venus (although there is some doubt about it),[196] which later astronomers took as confirmation of Ptolemy's theory.[197] In the 12th century, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah observed \"two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun\"; these were thought to be the transits of Venus and Mercury by 13th-century Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi, though this cannot be true as there were no Venus transits in Ibn Bajjah's lifetime.[198][note 4]\n\n\n\n### Venus and early modern astronomy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIn 1610 Galileo Galilei observed with his telescope that Venus showed phases, despite remaining near the Sun in Earth's sky (first image). This proved that it orbits the Sun and not Earth, as predicted by Copernicus's heliocentric model and disproved Ptolemy's geocentric model (second image).\n\nWhen the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei first observed the planet with a telescope in the early 17th century, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, and when it is closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.[201][202]\n\n\nThe 1639 transit of Venus was accurately predicted by Jeremiah Horrocks and observed by him and his friend, William Crabtree, at each of their respective homes, on 4\u00a0December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar in use at that time).[203]\n\n\n\n![A hand-drawn sequence of images showing Venus passing over the edge of the Sun's disk, leaving an illusory drop of shadow behind](image)The \"black drop effect\" as recorded during the 1769 transit\nThe atmosphere of Venus was discovered in 1761 by Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov.[204][205] Venus's atmosphere was observed in 1790 by German astronomer Johann Schr\u00f6ter. Schr\u00f6ter found when the planet was a thin crescent, the cusps extended through more than 180\u00b0. He correctly surmised this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere. Later, American astronomer Chester Smith Lyman observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction, providing further evidence for an atmosphere.[206] The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schr\u00f6ter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24\u00a0h from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface.[207]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century advances[edit]\n\n\nLittle more was discovered about Venus until the 20th century. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, and it was only with the development of spectroscopic and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed.\n\n\nSpectroscopic observations in the 1900s gave the first clues about the Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been thought.[208]\n\n\nThe first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.[209]\n\n\nIt had been noted that Venus had no discernible oblateness in its disk, suggesting a slow rotation, and some astronomers concluded based on this that it was tidally locked like Mercury was believed to be at the time; but other researchers had detected a significant quantity of heat coming from the planet's nightside, suggesting a quick rotation (a high surface temperature was not suspected at the time), confusing the issue.[210] Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde.\n\n\n\n### Space age[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of missions to Venus\n\nHumanity's first interplanetary spaceflight was achieved in 1961 with the robotic space probe *Venera 1* of the Soviet Venera program flying to Venus, though it lost contact en route.[211]\n\n\nTherefore the first successful interplanetary mission was the *Mariner 2* mission to Venus of the United States' Mariner program, passing on 14 December 1962 at 34,833\u00a0km (21,644\u00a0mi) above the surface of Venus and gathering data on the planet's atmosphere.[212][213]\n\n\nAdditionally radar observations of Venus were first carried out in the 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the actual value.[214]\n\n\n*Venera 3*, launched in 1966, became humanity's first probe and lander to reach and impact another celestial body other than the Moon, but could not return data as it crashed into the surface of Venus. In 1967, *Venera 4* was launched and successfully deployed science experiments in the Venusian atmosphere before impacting. *Venera 4* showed the surface temperature was hotter than *Mariner 2* had calculated, at almost 500\u00a0\u00b0C (932\u00a0\u00b0F), determined that the atmosphere was 95% carbon dioxide (CO  \n2), and discovered that Venus's atmosphere was considerably denser than *Venera 4*'s designers had anticipated.[215]\n\n\nIn an early example of space cooperation the data of *Venera 4* was joined with the 1967 *Mariner 5* data, analysed by a combined Soviet\u2013American science team in a series of colloquia over the following year.[216]\n\n\nOn 15 December 1970, *Venera 7* became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth.[217]\n\n\nIn 1974, *Mariner 10* swung by Venus to bend its path toward Mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds, revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the Venusian atmosphere. This was the first interplanetary gravity assist ever used, a technique which would be used by later probes.\n\n\nRadar observations in the 1970s revealed details of the Venusian surface for the first time. Pulses of radio waves were beamed at the planet using the 300\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0ft) radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory, and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions, designated the Alpha and Beta regions. The observations revealed a bright region attributed to mountains, which was called Maxwell Montes.[218] These three features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)First view and first clear 180-degree panorama of Venus's surface as well as any other planet than Earth (1975, Soviet *Venera\u00a09* lander).

The ground and the probe are the focus.\nIn 1975, the Soviet *Venera 9* and *10* landers transmitted the first images from the surface of Venus, which were in black and white. NASA obtained additional data with the Pioneer Venus project that consisted of two separate missions:[219] the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe and Pioneer Venus Orbiter, orbiting Venus between 1978 and 1992.[220] In 1982 the first colour images of the surface were obtained with the Soviet *Venera\u00a013* and *14* landers. After *Venera 15* and *16* operated between 1983 and 1984 in orbit, conducting detailed mapping of 25% of Venus's terrain (from the north pole to 30\u00b0N latitude), the successful Soviet Venera program came to a close.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)Global topographic map of Venus, with all probe landings marked\nIn 1985 the Vega program with its *Vega 1* and *Vega 2* missions carried the last entry probes and carried the first ever extraterrestrial aerobots for the first time achieving atmospheric flight outside Earth by employing inflatable balloons.\n\n\nBetween 1990 and 1994, *Magellan* operated in orbit until deorbiting, mapping the surface of Venus. Furthermore, probes like *Galileo* (1990),[222] *Cassini\u2013Huygens* (1998/1999), and *MESSENGER* (2006/2007) visited Venus with flybys flying to other destinations.\nIn April 2006, *Venus Express*, the first dedicated Venus mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), entered orbit around Venus. *Venus Express* provided unprecedented observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded the *Venus Express* mission in December 2014 deorbiting it in January 2015.[223]\n\n\nIn 2010, the first successful interplanetary solar sail spacecraft IKAROS traveled to Venus for a flyby.\n\n\n\n### Active and future missions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of missions to Venus \u00a7\u00a0Future missions\n\n![](image)WISPR visible light footage (2021) of the nightside, showing the hot faintly glowing surface, and its Aphrodite Terra as large dark patch, through the clouds, which prohibit such observations on the dayside when they are illuminated.[224][225]\nAs of 2023, the only active mission at Venus is Japan's *Akatsuki*, having achieved orbital insertion on 7\u00a0December 2015. Additionally, several flybys by other probes have been performed and studied Venus on their way, including NASA's Parker Solar Probe, and ESA's Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo.\n\n\nThere are currently several probes under development as well as multiple proposed missions still in their early conceptual stages.\n\n\nVenus has been identified for future research as an important case for understanding:\n\n\n\n* the origins of the solar system and Earth, and if systems and planets like ours are common or rare in the universe.\n* how planetary bodies evolve from their primordial states to today's diverse objects.\n* the development of conditions leading to habitable environments and life.[226]\n\n\n## Search for life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life on Venus\n\nSpeculation on the possibility of life on Venus's surface decreased significantly after the early 1960s when it became clear that conditions were extreme compared to those on Earth. Venus's extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressure make water-based life, as currently known, unlikely.\n\n\nSome scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the cooler, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.[227][228][229] Such speculations go back to 1967, when Carl Sagan and Harold J. Morowitz suggested in a *Nature* article that tiny objects detected in Venus's clouds might be organisms similar to Earth's bacteria (which are of approximately the same size):\n\n\n\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the clouds of Venus are a different story altogether. As was pointed out some years ago, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight\u2014the prerequisites for photosynthesis\u2014are plentiful in the vicinity of the clouds.[230]\nIn August 2019, astronomers led by Yeon Joo Lee reported that long-term pattern of absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of the planet Venus caused by \"unknown absorbers\", which may be chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere of the planet, affect the climate.[75] Their light absorbance is almost identical to that of micro-organisms in Earth's clouds. Similar conclusions have been reached by other studies.[231]\n\n\nIn September 2020, a team of astronomers led by Jane Greaves from Cardiff University announced the likely detection of phosphine, a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the Venusian surface or atmosphere, in the upper levels of the planet's clouds.[232][57][56][233][234] One proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms.[235] The phosphine was detected at heights of at least 30 miles above the surface, and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles. The discovery prompted NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of Venus, describing the phosphine find as \"the most significant development yet in building the case for life off Earth\".[236][237]\n\n\nSubsequent analysis of the data-processing used to identify phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus has raised concerns that the detection-line may be an artefact. The use of a 12th-order polynomial fit may have amplified noise and generated a false reading (see Runge's phenomenon). Observations of the atmosphere of Venus at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which a phosphine absorption line would be expected did not detect phosphine.[238] By late October 2020, re-analysis of data with a proper subtraction of background did not show a statistically significant detection of phosphine.[239][240][241]\n\n\nMembers of the team around Greaves, are working as part of a project by the MIT to send with the rocket company Rocket Lab the first private interplanetary space craft, to look for organics by entering the atmosphere of Venus with a probe, set to launch in January 2025.[242]\n\n\n\n### Planetary protection[edit]\n\n\nThe Committee on Space Research is a scientific organization established by the International Council for Science. Among their responsibilities is the development of recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination. For this purpose, space missions are categorized into five groups. Due to the harsh surface environment of Venus, Venus has been under the planetary protection category two.[243] This indicates that there is only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations.\n\n\n\n## Human presence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of missions to Venus\n\nVenus is the place of the first interplanetary human presence, mediated through robotic missions, with the first successful landings on another planet and extraterrestrial body other than the Moon. Currently in orbit is Akatsuki, and other probes routinely use Venus for gravity assist maneuvers capturing some data about Venus on the way.[244]\n\n\nThe only nation that has sent lander probes to the surface of Venus has been the Soviet Union,[note 5] which has been used by Russian officials to call Venus a \"Russian planet\".[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Crewed flight[edit]\n\n\nStudies of routes for crewed missions to Mars have since the 1960s proposed opposition missions instead of direct conjunction missions with Venus gravity assist flybys, demonstrating that they should be quicker and safer missions to Mars, with better return or abort flight windows, and less or the same amount of radiation exposure from the flight as direct Mars flights.[247][248]\n\n\nEarly in the space age the Soviet Union and the United States proposed the TMK-MAVR and Manned Venus flyby crewed flyby missions to Venus, though they were never realized.\n\n\n\n### Habitation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colonization of Venus and Floating cities and islands in fiction \u00a7\u00a0Venus\n\n![](image)Artist's rendering of a NASA High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) crewed floating outpost on Venus\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus are inhospitable, the atmospheric pressure, temperature, and solar and cosmic radiation 50\u00a0km above the surface are similar to those at Earth's surface.[132][131] With this in mind, Soviet engineer Sergey Zhitomirskiy (\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0416\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, 1929\u20132004) in 1971[249][250] and NASA aerospace engineer Geoffrey A. Landis in 2003[251] suggested the use of aerostats for crewed exploration and possibly for permanent \"floating cities\" in the Venusian atmosphere, an alternative to the popular idea of living on planetary surfaces such as Mars.[252][253] Among the many engineering challenges for any human presence in the atmosphere of Venus are the corrosive amounts of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.[251]\n\n\nNASA's High Altitude Venus Operational Concept is a mission concept that proposed a crewed aerostat design.\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venus in culture\n\n![](image)Venus is portrayed just to the right of the large cypress tree in Vincent van Gogh's 1889 painting *The Starry Night*.[254][255]\nVenus is a primary feature of the night sky, and so has been of remarkable importance in mythology, astrology and fiction throughout history and in different cultures.\n\n\nThe English name of Venus was originally the ancient Roman name for it. Romans named Venus after their goddess of love, who in turn was based on the ancient Greek goddess of love Aphrodite,[256] who was herself based on the similar Sumerian religion goddess Inanna (which is Ishtar in Akkadian religion), all of whom were associated with the planet.[257][258] The weekday of the planet and these goddesses is Friday, named after the Germanic goddess Frigg, who has been associated with the Roman goddess Venus.\n\n\n\n![](image)The eight-pointed star a symbol used in some cultures for Venus, and sometimes combined into a star and crescent arrangement. Here the eight pointed star is the Star of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus goddess, alongside the solar disk of her brother Shamash and the crescent moon of their father Sin on a boundary stone of Meli-Shipak II, dating to the twelfth century BC.\n\nSeveral hymns praise Inanna in her role as the goddess of the planet Venus.[187][258][257] Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna's movements may correspond with the movements of the planet Venus in the sky.[187] The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature.[187] In *Inanna's Descent to the Underworld*, unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East.[187] An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for *Kur*, what could be presumed to be, the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West.[187] In *Inanna and Shukaletuda* and *Inanna's Descent into the Underworld* appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus.[187] In *Inanna and Shukaletuda*, Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons.[259] In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.[187]\n\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks possibly knew by the second millennium BC or at the latest by the Late Period, under mesopotamian influence that the morning star and an evening star were one and the same.[260][261] The Egyptians knew the morning star as *Tioumoutiri* and the evening star as *Ouaiti*.[262] They depicted Venus at first as a phoenix or heron (see Bennu),[260] calling it \"the crosser\" or \"star with crosses\",[260] associating it with Osiris, and later depicting it two-headed with human or falco heads, and associated it with Horus,[261] son of Isis (which during the even later Hellenistic period was together with Hathor identified with Aphrodite). The Greeks used the names *Ph\u014dsphoros* (\u03a6\u03c9\u03c3\u03d5\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"light-bringer\" (whence the element phosphorus; alternately *\u0112\u014dsphoros* (\u1f28\u03c9\u03c3\u03d5\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"dawn-bringer\"), for the morning star, and *Hesperos* (\u1f1d\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"Western one\", for the evening star,[263] both children of dawn Eos and therefore grandchildren of Aphrodite. Though by the Roman era they were recognized as one celestial object, known as \"the star of Venus\", the traditional two Greek names continued to be used, though usually translated to Latin as *L\u016bcifer* and *Vesper*.[263][264]\n\n\nClassical poets such as Homer, Sappho, Ovid and Virgil spoke of the star and its light.[265] Poets such as William Blake, Robert Frost, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth wrote odes to it.[266]\n\n\nIn India, Shukra Graha (\"the planet Shukra\") is named after the powerful saint Shukra. *Shukra* which is used in Indian Vedic astrology[267] means \"clear, pure\" or \"brightness, clearness\" in Sanskrit. One of the nine Navagraha, it is held to affect wealth, pleasure and reproduction; it was the son of Bhrgu, preceptor of the Daityas, and guru of the Asuras.[268] The word *Shukra* is also associated with semen, or generation.\n\n\nVenus is known as Kejora in Indonesian and Malaysian Malay.\n\n\nIn Chinese the planet is called J\u012bn-x\u012bng (\u91d1\u661f), the golden planet of the metal element. Modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the \"metal star\" (\u91d1\u661f), based on the Five elements.[269][270][271][272]\n\n\nThe Maya considered Venus to be the most important celestial body after the Sun and Moon. They called it *Chac ek*,[273] or *Noh Ek*', \"the Great Star\".[274] The cycles of Venus were important to their calendar and were described in some of their books such as *Maya Codex of Mexico* and *Dresden Codex.*\n\n\n\n### Modern culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Venus in fiction\n\nWith the invention of the telescope, the idea that Venus was a physical world and a possible destination began to take form.\n\n\nThe impenetrable Venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was often depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans.[275] The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed reality to be quite different and brought this particular genre to an end.[276] As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.[277]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venus symbol\n\n![](image)\nThe symbol of a circle with a small cross beneath is the so-called Venus symbol, gaining its name for being used as the astronomical symbol for Venus. The symbol is of ancient Greek origin, and represents more generally femininity, adopted by biology as gender symbol for female,[278][279][280] like the Mars symbol for male and sometimes the Mercury symbol for hermaphrodite. This gendered association of Venus and Mars has been used to pair them heteronormatively, describing women and men stereotypically as being so different that they can be understood as coming from different planets, an understanding popularized in 1992 by the book titled *Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus*.[281][282]\n\n\nThe Venus symbol was also used in Western alchemy representing the element copper (like the symbol of Mercury is also the symbol of the element mercury),[279][280] and since polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity the symbol for Venus has sometimes been called Venus mirror, representing the mirror of the goddess, although this origin has been discredited as an unlikely origin.[279][280]\n\n\nBeside the Venus symbol, many other symbols have been associated with Venus, other common ones are the crescent or particularly the star, as with the Star of Ishtar.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Solar System portal\n* ![](image)Outer space portal\n* ![](image)Astronomy portal\n\n\n* Outline of Venus\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n* Venus zone\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Misstated as \"Ganiki Chasma\" in the press release and scientific publication.[116]\n2. **^** The equatorial speed of Earth is given as both about 1674.4\u00a0km/h and 1669.8\u00a0km/h by reliable sources. The simplest way to determine the correct figure is to multiply Earth's radius of 6378137 m (WGS84) and Earth's angular speed, 7.2921150\u00d710\u22125 rad/s,[143] yielding 465.1011 m/s = 1674.364\u00a0km/h. The incorrect figure of 1669.8\u00a0km/h is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by 24\u00a0h. But the correct speed must be relative to inertial space, so the stellar day of 86164.098903691 s/3600 = 23.934472 h (23 h 56 m 4.0989 s) must be used.[144] Thus 2\u03c0(6378.137\u00a0km)/23.934472 h = 1674.364\u00a0km/h.[145]\n3. **^** It is important to be clear about the meaning of \"closeness\". In the astronomical literature, the term \"closest planets\" often refers to the two planets that approach each other the most closely. In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. Essentially because Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is \"closest to Earth when averaged over time\". However, using this time-average definition of \"closeness\", it turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to *all* other planets in the solar system. For that reason, arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme \"More or Less\" explains the different notions of proximity well.[165]\n4. **^** Several claims of transit observations made by medieval Islamic astronomers have been shown to be sunspots.[199] Avicenna did not record the date of his observation. There was a transit of Venus within his lifetime, on 24 May 1032, although it is questionable whether it would have been visible from his location.[200]\n5. **^** The American Pioneer Venus Multiprobe has brought the only non-Soviet probes to enter the atmosphere, as atmospheric entry probes only briefly signals were received from the surface.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Venusian\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

With the Magellan synthetic-aperture radar full-resolution radar map left- and right-look global mosaics at 75 m-per-pixel resolution, we developed a global catalog of volcanoes on Venus that contains ~85,000 edifices, ~99% of which are <5 km in diameter. We find that Venus hosts far more volcanoes than previously mapped, and that although they are distributed across virtually the entire planet, size\u2013frequency distribution analysis reveals a relative lack of edifices in the 20\u2013100 km diameter range, which could be related to magma availability and eruption rate.\n108. **^** Karttunen, Hannu; Kroger, P.; Oja, H.; Poutanen, M.; Donner, K.

This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\n\n\nEarth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76\u00a0\u00b0C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.\n\n\nEarth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000\u00a0km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400\u00a0km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.\n\n\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth with the exception of Antarctica. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Modern English word  *Earth* developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled *eor\u00f0e*.[24] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as \\**er\u00fe\u014d*. In its earliest attestation, the word *eor\u00f0e* was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin *terra* and Greek \u03b3\u1fc6 *g\u0113*: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tell\u016bs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included J\u00f6r\u00f0 ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[25]\n\n\nHistorically, *earth* has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as \"the globe\" was expressed as *the* earth. By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and *the earth* was also written *the Earth*, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as *Earth*, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though *earth* and forms with *the* remain common.[24] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (for example, \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by *the* (for example, \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"[26]\n\n\nOccasionally, the name *Terra* /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259/ is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[27] while in poetry *Tellus* /\u02c8t\u025bl\u0259s/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[28] *Terra* is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish *Tierra* and the French *Terre*). The Latinate form *G\u00e6a* or *Gaea* (English: /\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0.\u0259/) of the Greek poetic name *Gaia* (\u0393\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1; Ancient Greek: [\u0261\u00e2i\u032f.a] or [\u0261\u00e2j.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling *Gaia* has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /\u02c8\u0261a\u026a.\u0259/ rather than the more classical English /\u02c8\u0261e\u026a.\u0259/.[29]\n\n\nThere are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From *Earth* itself comes *earthly*. From the Latin *Terra* comes *terran* /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259n/,[30] terrestrial /t\u0259\u02c8r\u025bstri\u0259l/,[31] and (via French) *terrene* /t\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0n/,[32] and from the Latin *Tellus* comes *tellurian* /t\u025b\u02c8l\u028a\u0259ri\u0259n/[33] and *telluric*.[34]\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Earth and Timeline of natural history\n\n### Formation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early Earth and Hadean\n\n![](image)An artist's impression of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of which Earth and other Solar System bodies were formed\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002  \n\u22120.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[35] By 4.54\u00b10.04\u00a0Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[36] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[37]\n\n\nEstimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.[38] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[39] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[40][41] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8\u00a0Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[42]\n\n\n\n### After formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geological history of Earth\n\n![](image)*Pale orange dot*, an artist's impression of Early Earth, featuring its tinted orange methane-rich early atmosphere[43]\nEarth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[44] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[45] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[46] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[47] By 3.5\u00a0Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[48]\n\n\nAs the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust.[49] The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4\u00a0Ga, only 140\u00a0Ma after Earth's formation.[50] There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance:[51] (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day,[52] which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists,[53][54] which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.[55]\n\n\nNew continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750\u00a0Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600\u2013540\u00a0Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180\u00a0Ma.[56]\n\n\nThe most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40\u00a0Ma,[57] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3\u00a0Ma.[58] High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[59] The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.[60]\n\n\n\n### Origin of life and evolution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Origin of life, Earliest known life forms, and History of life\n\n![](image)Artist's impression of the Archean, the eon after Earth's formation, featuring round stromatolites, which are early oxygen-producing forms of life from billions of years ago. After the Late Heavy Bombardment, Earth's crust had cooled, its water-rich barren surface is marked by continents and volcanoes, with the Moon still orbiting Earth half as close than today, appearing 2.8 times larger and producing strong tides.[61]\nChemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[62] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[63] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[64] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[65] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48\u00a0billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[66] biogenic graphite found in 3.7\u00a0billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[67] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1\u00a0billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[68][69] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[70][71]\n\n\nDuring the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539\u00a0Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"Snowball Earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[72][73] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535\u00a0Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones.[74] Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66\u00a0Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66\u00a0Mys, and several million years ago an African ape species gained the ability to stand upright.[75][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[76]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Future of Earth\n\nSee also: Global catastrophic risk\n![A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun](image)Conjectured illustration of the scorched Earth after the Sun has entered the red giant phase, about 5\u20137 billion years from nowEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1\u00a0billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5\u00a0billion years by 40%.[77] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10\u00a0ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100\u2013900\u00a0million years.[78][79] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[80] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100\u00a0\u00b0C (212\u00a0\u00b0F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[81] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[81][82]\n\n\nThe Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5\u00a0billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1\u00a0AU (150\u00a0million\u00a0km; 93\u00a0million\u00a0mi), about 250 times its present radius.[77][83] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7\u00a0AU (250\u00a0million\u00a0km; 160\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[77]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Geophysics\n\n### Size and shape[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Figure of the Earth\n\nFurther information: Earth radius, Earth's circumference, Earth curvature, and Geomorphology\n\nSee also: List of highest mountains on Earth\n\n![](image)Earth's western hemisphere showing topography relative to Earth's center (instead of to mean sea level, as in common topographic maps)\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium,[84] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918\u00a0mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.\n\n\nDue to Earth's rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its Equator; its diameter is 43 kilometers (27\u00a0mi) longer there than at its poles.[85][86]\nEarth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. Though the largest local variations, like the Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level),[87] only shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%.[n 5][89] Since Earth's surface is farthest out from Earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,384.4\u00a0km or 3,967.1\u00a0mi) is its farthest point out.[90][91]\nParallel to the rigid land topography the Ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.[92]\n\n\nTo measure the local variation of Earth's topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a shape called a geoid. Such a geoid shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but gravitational irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level (MSL) as a reference level for topographic measurements.[93]\n\n\n\n### Surface[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Planetary surface, Land cover, Land, Pedosphere, Ocean, Sea, Cryosphere, and Peplosphere\n\n![](image)A composite image of Earth, with its different types of surface discernible: Earth's surface dominating Ocean (blue), Africa with lush (green) to dry (brown) land and Earth's polar ice in the form of Antarctic sea ice (grey) covering the Antarctic or Southern Ocean and the Antarctic ice sheet (white) covering Antarctica.\nEarth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, Earth's shape is an idealized spheroid \u2013 a squashed sphere \u2013 with a surface area of about 510\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (197\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\n\nMost of Earth's surface is ocean water: 70.8% or 361\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (139\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[94] This vast pool of salty water is often called the *world ocean*,[95][96] and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world[97][98] or ocean world.[99][100] Indeed, in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely.[101] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust, but to a lesser extent with shelf seas also shelves of the continental crust. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes,[85] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.\n\n\nAt Earth's polar regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming polar ice caps.\n\n\nEarth's land covers 29.2%, or 149\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (58\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass).[102][103][104] These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of \u2212418\u00a0m (\u22121,371\u00a0ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797\u00a0m (2,615\u00a0ft).[105]\n\n\nLand can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation,[106] but ice sheets (10%,[107] not including the equally large land under permafrost)[108] or cold as well as hot deserts (33%)[109] occupy also considerable amounts of it.\n\n\nThe pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[110][111] Earth has an estimated 16.7\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (6.4\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of cropland and 33.5\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (12.9\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of pastureland.[112]\n\n\nThe land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth's crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's lithosphere. Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks.[113] Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Relief of Earth's crust\nEarth's surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth's land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4\u00a0km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level.\n\n\nEarth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Plate tectonics\n\n![Shows the extent and boundaries of tectonic plates, with superimposed outlines of the continents they support](image)Earth's major plates, which are:[117]* Pacific Plate\n* African Plate[n 6]\n* North American Plate\n* Eurasian Plate\n* Antarctic Plate\n* Indo-Australian Plate\n* South American Plate\n\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur.[118] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[119]\n\n\nAs the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100\u00a0Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200\u00a0Ma old.[120][121] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030\u00a0Ma,[122] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400\u00a0Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.[50]\n\n\nThe seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55\u00a0Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75\u00a0mm/a (3.0\u00a0in/year)[123] and the Pacific Plate moving 52\u201369\u00a0mm/a (2.0\u20132.7\u00a0in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6\u00a0mm/a (0.42\u00a0in/year).[124]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Internal structure of Earth\n\n\n\nGeologic layers of Earth[125]\n| ![](image)Illustration of Earth's cutaway, not to scale\n |\n| Depth[126](km) | Component layer name\n | Density(g/cm3) |\n| 0\u201360\n | Lithosphere[n 7] | \u2014\n |\n| 0\u201335\n | Crust[n 8] | 2.2\u20132.9\n |\n| 35\u2013660\n | Upper mantle | 3.4\u20134.4\n |\n| 660\u20132890\n | Lower mantle | 3.4\u20135.6\n |\n| 100\u2013700\n | Asthenosphere | \u2014\n |\n| 2890\u20135100\n | Outer core | 9.9\u201312.2\n |\n| 5100\u20136378\n | Inner core | 12.8\u201313.1\n |\n\n\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity.[127] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7\u00a0mi) under the oceans to 30\u201350\u00a0km (19\u201331\u00a0mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.[128]\n\n\nBeneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660\u00a0km (250 and 410\u00a0mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.[129] Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1\u20130.5\u00b0 per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed.[130] The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.\nDensity increases with depth, as described in the table on the right.\n\n\nAmong the Solar System's planetary-sized objects Earth is the object with the highest density.\n\n\n\n### Chemical composition[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Abundance of elements on Earth\n\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97\u00d71024\u00a0kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[131][49] The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.[132][131]\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's internal heat budget\n\n![](image)Global map of heat flow from Earth's interior to the surface of Earth's crust, mostly along the oceanic ridges\nThe major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.[133] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000\u00a0\u00b0C (10,830\u00a0\u00b0F),[134] and the pressure could reach 360\u00a0GPa (52\u00a0million\u00a0psi).[135] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3\u00a0Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.[136][137]\n\n\nThe mean heat loss from Earth is 87\u00a0mW m\u22122, for a global heat loss of 4.42\u00d71013\u00a0W.[138] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts.[139] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.[140]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gravity of Earth\n\nThe gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8\u00a0m/s2 (32\u00a0ft/s2). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's magnetic field\n\n![Diagram showing the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetosphere. The lines are swept back in the anti-solar direction under the influence of the solar wind.](image)Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, with the solar wind flows from left to right\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05\u00d710\u22125 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79\u00d71022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average).[142] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.[143][144]\n\n\nThe extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.[145] Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.[146] Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates.[147][148] The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,[149] and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.[150][151]\n\n\nDuring magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.[152]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's rotation\n\n![](image)Satellite time lapse imagery of Earth's rotation showing axis tilt\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun\u2014its mean solar day\u2014is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[153] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.[154][155]\n\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its *stellar day* by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[2][n 9] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90\u00b0 on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s).[2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4\u00a0ms.[156]\n\n\nApart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15\u00b0/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Orbit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Earth's orbit and Earth's location\n\n![](image)Exaggerated illustration of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, marking that the orbital extreme points (apoapsis and periapsis) are not the same as the four seasonal extreme points (equinox and solstice)\nEarth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System. Earth's average orbital distance is about 150\u00a0million\u00a0km (93\u00a0million\u00a0mi), which is the basis for the Astronomical Unit and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon.\n\n\nEarth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1\u00b0/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12\u00a0hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24\u00a0hours\u2014a solar day\u2014for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.\n\n\nThe orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78\u00a0km/s (107,200\u00a0km/h; 66,600\u00a0mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742\u00a0km (7,918\u00a0mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000\u00a0km (239,000\u00a0mi), in about 3.5 hours.[3]\n\n\nThe Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32\u00a0days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth\u2013Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53\u00a0days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth\u2013Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to \u00b15.1 degrees against the Earth\u2013Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.[3][159]\n\n\nThe Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5\u00a0million\u00a0km (930,000\u00a0mi) in radius.[160][n 10] This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.[160] Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000\u00a0light-years from its center. It is about 20\u00a0light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.[161]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt and seasons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Axial tilt \u00a7\u00a0Earth\n\n![](image)Earth's axial tilt causing different angles of seasonal illumination at different orbital positions around the Sun\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\u00b0[2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.[162] Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.[163][164]\n\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.[165]\n\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6\u00a0years.[166] The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.[167]\n\n\nIn modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.[168][n 11] Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.[169]\n\n\n\n## Earth\u2013Moon system[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Satellite system (astronomy)\n\n### Moon[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Moon, Lunar theory, and Orbit of the Moon\n\n![](image)Earth and the Moon as seen from Mars in an image taken by NASA's *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* on 22 April 2022\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto.[170][171] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.[172] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.[40]\n\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth.[173] The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.[174] As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases.[175] Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38\u00a0mm/a (1.5\u00a0in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23\u00a0\u00b5s/yr\u2014add up to significant changes.[176] During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620\u00a0Ma) there were 400\u00b17 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9\u00b10.4 hours.[177]\n\n\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.[178] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.[179][180]\n\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.[158] This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.[181]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### Asteroids and artificial satellites[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Near-Earth object and Claimed moons of Earth\n\n![](image)A computer-generated image mapping the prevalence of artificial satellites and space debris around Earth in geosynchronous and low Earth orbit\nEarth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa.[184][185] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun.[186] The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.[187]\n\n\nAs of September\u00a02021[update], there are 4,550 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth.[188] There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris.[n 12] Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.[189]\n\n\n\n## Hydrosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrosphere\n\n![](image)A view of Earth with its global ocean and cloud cover, which dominate Earth's surface and hydrosphere. At Earth's polar regions, its hydrosphere forms larger areas of ice cover\nEarth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution.\nMost of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Nevertheless, Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft). The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35\u00d71018\u00a0metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (139.7\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with a mean depth of 3,682\u00a0m (12,080\u00a0ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332\u00a0billion\u00a0km3 (320\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0mi).[190] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8\u00a0km (1.68 to 1.74\u00a0mi).[191] About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.[192][193] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.[194] The remaining 30% is ground water, 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land)[195] and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere, biological binding, etc. .[196][197]\n\n\nIn Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms.[198] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.[199]\n\n\nThe average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35\u00a0grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[200] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[201] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.[202] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.[203] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation.[204]\n\n\nThe abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water.[205] Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.[206]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Earth\n\n![](image)A view of Earth with different layers of its atmosphere visible: the troposphere with its clouds casting shadows, a band of stratospheric blue sky at the horizon, and a line of green airglow of the lower thermosphere around an altitude of 100\u00a0km, at the edge of space\nThe atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325\u00a0kPa (14.696\u00a0psi),[207] with a scale height of about 8.5\u00a0km (5.3\u00a0mi).[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[207] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%[207] but averages about 1%.[3] Clouds cover around two thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land.[208] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) at the poles to 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.[209]\n\n\nEarth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7\u00a0Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen\u2013oxygen atmosphere of today.[63] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[210] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[211] This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F), in contrast to the current +15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F),[212] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[213]\n\n\n\n### Weather and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Weather and Climate\n\n![](image)\nThe ITCZ's band of clouds over the Eastern Pacific and the Americas as seen from space\n![](image)\nWorldwide K\u00f6ppen climate classifications\n\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.[214] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere.[215] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.[216]\n\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.[217] Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[218]\n\n\nEarth receives 1361\u00a0W/m2 of\u00a0solar irradiance.[219][220] The amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C (0.7\u00a0\u00b0F) per degree of latitude from the equator.[221] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.[222]\n\n\nFurther factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.[223] Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land.[224] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land.[225] Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.[226]\n\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.[216] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.[227]\n\n\nThe commonly used K\u00f6ppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.[217] The K\u00f6ppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.[228] Surface air temperature can rise to around 55\u00a0\u00b0C (131\u00a0\u00b0F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as \u221289\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128\u00a0\u00b0F) in Antarctica.[229][230]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earth's atmosphere as it appears from space, as bands of different colours at the horizon. From the bottom, afterglow illuminates the troposphere in orange with silhouettes of clouds, and the stratosphere in white and blue. Next the mesosphere (pink area) extends to just below the edge of space at one hundred kilometers and the pink line of airglow of the lower thermosphere (invisible), which hosts green and red aurorae over several hundred kilometers.\nThe upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere,[231] is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[211] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[232] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, defined as 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[233]\n\n\nThermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[234] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.[235] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.[236] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.[237]\n\n\n\n## Life on Earth[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Biosphere and History of life\n\n![](image)An animation of the changing density of productive vegetation on land (low in brown; heavy in dark green) and phytoplankton at the ocean surface (low in purple; high in yellow)\nEarth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed.\n\n\nEarth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere.[238] Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing changes like the Great Oxidation Event.[239]\n\n\nEarth's life has over time greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes, which are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals.[240] The different biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths, planetary temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity. Earth's species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions. While freezing polar regions and high altitudes, or extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life.[241]\n\n\nEarth provides liquid water\u2014an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism.[242] Plants and other organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.[243]\n\n\nExtreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.[244] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.[245] Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.[246] Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming.[247] This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[248]\n\n\n\n## Human geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human geography\n\nSee also: World\n\n![](image)A composite image of artificial light emissions at night on a map of Earth\nOriginating from earlier primates in eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land.[249] In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.\n\n\nHuman population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s,[250] and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century.[251] Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.[251]\n\n\nDistribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth,[252] partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world's land mass, with 68% of the world's land mass being in the Northern Hemisphere.[253] Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century.[254]\n\n\nBeyond Earth's surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only special purpose deep underground and underwater presence, and a few space stations. Human population virtually completely remains on Earth's surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.[255][256]\n\n\nEarth has been subject to extensive human settlement, and humans have developed diverse societies and cultures. Most of Earth's land has been territorially claimed since the 19th century by sovereign states (countries) separated by political borders, and more than 200 such states exist today,[257] with only parts of Antarctica and few small regions remaining unclaimed.[258] Most of these states together form the United Nations, the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization,[259] which extends human governance over the ocean and Antarctica, and therefore all of Earth.\n\n\n\n### Natural resources and land use[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Natural resource and Land use\n\n![](image)Earth's land use for human agriculture\nEarth has resources that have been exploited by humans.[260] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales.[261] Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.[262] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.[263] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.[264] These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.[265]\n\n\nEarth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.[266] In 2019, 39\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (15\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (4.6\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) was shrub and grassland, 40\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (15\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (4.2\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were cultivated as croplands.[267] Of the 12\u201314% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015.[268] Humans use building materials to construct shelters.[269]\n\n\n\n### Humans and the environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human impact on the environment and Climate change\n\n![The graph from 1880 to 2020 shows natural drivers exhibiting fluctuations of about 0.3 degrees Celsius. Human drivers steadily increase by 0.3 degrees over 100 years to 1980, then steeply by 0.8 degrees more over the past 40 years.](image)Change in average surface air temperature and drivers for that change. Human activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability.[270]\nHuman activities have impacted Earth's environments. Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth's energy budget and climate.[247][271] It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C (2.2\u00a0\u00b0F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline.[272] This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[248]\n\n\nThe concept of planetary boundaries was introduced to quantify humanity's impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five have been crossed: Biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are thought to have passed the safe threshold.[273][274] As of 2018, no country meets the basic needs of its population without transgressing planetary boundaries. It is thought possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within sustainable levels of resource use.[275]\n\n\n\n## Cultural and historical viewpoint[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Earth in culture and Earth symbol\n\n![Woman seeing the Earth from space through a window](image)Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a NASA astronaut, observing Earth from the *Cupola* module at the International Space Station on 11 September 2010\nHuman cultures have developed many views of the planet.[276] The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, ![\ud83d\udf28](image),[277] representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger, ![\u2641](image). Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity.[278] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.[278] The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.[279][280][281]\n\n\nImages of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.[282][283] In particular, this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation,[284] humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally,[285] acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth's environments.\n\n\nScientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides.[286][287] Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.[288]\n\n\nIt was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.[289] Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400\u00a0million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.[290][291]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Celestial sphere\n* Earth phase\n* Earth physical characteristics tables\n* Earth science\n* Extremes on Earth\n* List of Solar System extremes\n* Outline of Earth\n* Table of physical properties of planets in the Solar System\n* Timeline of natural history\n* Timeline of the far future\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** All astronomical quantities vary, both secularly and periodically.

The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname \"**the Red Planet**\".[21][22] Mars's radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5\u00a0km (2,106\u00a0mi). The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide, and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.\n\n\nGeologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping across the landscape and marsquakes (Martian analog to earthquakes) trembling underneath the ground. The surface of Mars hosts a large shield volcano (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). Mars's significant orbital eccentricity and axial tilt cause large seasonal changes to the polar ice caps' coverage and temperature swings between \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212166\u00a0\u00b0F) to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) on the surface. A Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years.\n\n\nLike the other planets in the Solar System, Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to 3.2\u20132 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues to the present, was marked by the wind's influence on geological processes. It is unknown whether life has ever existed on Mars.\n\n\nMars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and thus has been known from ancient times. Its high-contrast albedo features make it a common subject for viewing with a telescope. Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the first flyby by the *Mariner 4* probe in 1965, the first Mars orbiter by the *Mars 2* probe in 1971, and the first landing by *Viking 1* in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11 active probes orbiting Mars or at the Martian surface. Currently, Mars is an attractive target for the first future interplanetary human missions.\n\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geological history of Mars\n\nScientists have theorized that during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created as the result of a random process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are much more common on Mars than on Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.[23]\n\n\nAfter the formation of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called \"Late Heavy Bombardment\". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,[24][25][26] whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300\u00a0mi), or roughly four times the size of the Moon's South Pole \u2013 Aitken basin, the largest impact basin yet discovered.[27] This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy, created the smooth Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.[28][29]\n\n\nA 2023 study shows evidence, based on the orbital inclination of Deimos (a small moon of Mars), that Mars may once had a ring system 3.5 billion years to 4 billion years ago.[30] This ring system may have been formed from a moon, 20 times more massive than Phobos, orbiting Mars billions of years ago; and Phobos would be a remnant of that ring.[31][32]\n\n\nThe geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the three primary periods:[33][34]\n\n\n\n* Noachian period: Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5\u00a0billion years ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period. Named after Noachis Terra.[35]\n* Hesperian period: 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9\u00a0billion years ago. The Hesperian period is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains. Named after Hesperia Planum.[35]\n* Amazonian period: between 3.3 and 2.9\u00a0billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars. Named after Amazonis Planitia.[35]\n\n\nGeological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200\u00a0mya. Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20\u00a0Mya, indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions.[36] The *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* has captured images of avalanches.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Mars\n\n![](image)\nComparison: Earth and Mars\nAnimation (00:40) showing major features of Mars\nVideo (01:28) showing how three NASA orbiters mapped the gravity field of Mars\n\nMars is approximately half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land.[2] Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by ferric oxide, or rust.[39] It can look like butterscotch;[40] other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nLike Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.[41][42] Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16\u201317% sulfur.[43] This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as Earth's.[44] The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 kilometres (78\u00a0mi).[44] By comparison, Earth's crust averages 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) in thickness.[45][46]\n\n\nMars is seismically active. In 2019, it was reported that InSight (now offline) had detected and recorded over 450 marsquakes and related events.[47][48] In 2021 it was reported that based on eleven low-frequency marsquakes detected by the *InSight* lander the core of Mars was indeed liquid and had a radius of about 1830\u00b140\u00a0km and a temperature around 1900\u20132000\u00a0K. The Martian core radius is abnormally large, accounting for more than half the radius of Mars and about half the size of Earth's core. To this, it has been suggested that the core contains some amount of lighter elements like oxygen and hydrogen in addition to the iron\u2013nickel alloy and about 15% of sulfur.[49][50]\n\n\nThe core of Mars is overlaid by the rocky mantle, which does not seem to have a thermally insulating layer analogous to the Earth's lower mantle.[50] The Martian mantle appears to be solid down to the depth of about 500\u00a0km, where the low-velocity zone (partially melted asthenosphere) begins.[51] Below the asthenosphere the velocity of seismic waves starts to grow again; and at the depth of about 1050\u00a0km lies the boundary of the transition zone extending down to the core.[50]\n\n\nFurther analysis of data from the InSight lander has suggested that Mars has a liquid core.[52][53] On 25 October 2023, scientists, helped by information from InSight, reported that Mars has a radioactive magma ocean under its crust.[54]\n\n\n\n### Surface geology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Martian soil\n![](image)*Curiosity*'s view of Martian soil and boulders after crossing the \"Dingo Gap\" sand dune\nMars is a terrestrial planet with a surface that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The Martian surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt,[55] although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth, or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found.[56] Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.[57]\n\n\nAlthough Mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field,[58] observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October\u00a02005 (with the help of the *Mars Global Surveyor*), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.[59]\n\n\nThe *Phoenix* lander returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth. They are necessary for growth of plants.[60] Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate,[61][62] concentrations that are toxic to humans.[63][64]\n\n\nStreaks are common across Mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils.[65] Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.[66][67]\n\n\nRadiation levels on the surface are on average 0.64 millisieverts of radiation per day, and significantly less than the radiation of\u00a01.84 millisieverts per day or 22 millirads per day during the flight to and from Mars.[68][69] For comparison the radiation levels in low Earth orbit, where Earth's space stations orbit, are around 0.5 millisieverts of radiation per day.[70] Hellas Planitia has the lowest surface radiation at about 0.342 millisieverts per day, featuring lava tubes southwest of Hadriacus Mons with potentially levels as low as 0.064 millisieverts per day.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography and features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Mars\n\nFurther information: Areoid\n\nSee also: Category:Surface features of Mars\n\n![](image)A MOLA-based topographic map showing highlands (red and orange) dominating the Southern Hemisphere of Mars, lowlands (blue) the northern. Volcanic plateaus delimit regions of the northern plains, whereas the highlands are punctuated by several large impact basins.\nAlthough better remembered for mapping the Moon, Johann Heinrich M\u00e4dler and Wilhelm Beer were the first areographers. They began by establishing that most of Mars's surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet's rotation period. In 1840, M\u00e4dler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars.[72]\n\n\nFeatures on Mars are named from a variety of sources. Albedo features are named for classical mythology. Craters larger than roughly 50\u00a0km are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of Mars. Smaller craters are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than 100,000. Large valleys are named for the word \"Mars\" or \"star\" in various languages; smaller valleys are named for rivers.[73]\n\n\nLarge albedo features retain many of the older names but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, *Nix Olympica* (the snows of Olympus) has become *Olympus Mons* (Mount Olympus).[74] The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian \"continents\" and given names like Arabia Terra (*land of Arabia*) or Amazonis Planitia (*Amazonian plain*). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum.[75] The permanent northern polar ice cap is named Planum Boreum. The southern cap is called Planum Australe.[76]\n\n\nMars's equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its Prime Meridian was specified, as was Earth's (at Greenwich), by choice of an arbitrary point; M\u00e4dler and Beer selected a line for their first maps of Mars in 1830. After the spacecraft *Mariner 9* provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972, a small crater (later called Airy-0), located in the Sinus Meridiani (\"Middle Bay\" or \"Meridian Bay\"), was chosen by Merton Davies, Harold Masursky, and G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs for the definition of 0.0\u00b0 longitude to coincide with the original selection.[77][78][79]\n\n\nBecause Mars has no oceans and hence no \"sea level\", a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as a reference level; this is called the *areoid*[80] of Mars, analogous to the terrestrial geoid.[81] Zero altitude was defined by the height at which there is 610.5\u00a0Pa (6.105\u00a0mbar) of atmospheric pressure.[82] This pressure corresponds to the triple point of water, and it is about 0.6% of the sea level surface pressure on Earth (0.006 atm).[83]\n\n\nFor mapping purposes, the United States Geological Survey divides the surface of Mars into thirty cartographic quadrangles, each named for a classical albedo feature it contains.[84] In April 2023, *The New York Times* reported an updated global map of Mars based on images from the Hope spacecraft.[85] A related, but much more detailed, global Mars map was released by NASA on 16 April 2023.[86]\n\n\n\n### Volcanoes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanology of Mars\n\n![](image)Picture of the largest volcano on Mars, Olympus Mons. It is approximately 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) across.\nThe vast upland region Tharsis contain several extinct volcanoes, which include the shield volcano Olympus Mons (*Mount Olympus*). The edifice is over 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) wide.[87][88] Because the mountain is so large, with complex structure at its edges, giving a definite height to it is difficult. Its local relief, from the foot of the cliffs which form its northwest margin to its peak, is over 21\u00a0km (13\u00a0mi),[88] a little over twice the height of Mauna Kea as measured from its base on the ocean floor. The total elevation change from the plains of Amazonis Planitia, over 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) to the northwest, to the summit approaches 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi),[89] roughly three times the height of Mount Everest, which in comparison stands at just over 8.8 kilometres (5.5\u00a0mi). Consequently, Olympus Mons is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the Solar System; the only known mountain which might be taller is the Rheasilvia peak on the asteroid Vesta, at 20\u201325\u00a0km (12\u201316\u00a0mi).[90]\n\n\n\n### Impact topography[edit]\n\n\nThe dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. It is possible that, four billion years ago, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of Earth's Moon. If this is the case, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars would be the site of an impact crater 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300\u00a0mi) in size, or roughly the area of Europe, Asia, and Australia combined, surpassing Utopia Planitia and the Moon's South Pole\u2013Aitken basin as the largest impact crater in the Solar System.[91][92][93]\n\n\nMars is scarred by a number of impact craters: a total of 43,000 craters with a diameter of 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) or greater have been found.[94] The largest exposed crater is Hellas, which is 2,300 kilometres (1,400\u00a0mi) wide and 7,000 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) deep, and is a light albedo feature clearly visible from Earth.[95][96] There are other notable impact features, such as Argyre, which is around 1,800 kilometres (1,100\u00a0mi) in diameter,[97] and Isidis, which is around 1,500 kilometres (930\u00a0mi) in diameter.[98] Due to the smaller mass and size of Mars, the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth. Mars is located closer to the asteroid belt, so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source. Mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets, *i.e.*, those that lie within the orbit of Jupiter.[99]\n\n\nMartian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted.[100]\n\n\n\n### Tectonic sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Valles Marineris, taken by the *Viking 1* probe\nThe large canyon, Valles Marineris (Latin for \"Mariner Valleys\", also known as Agathodaemon in the old canal maps[101]), has a length of 4,000 kilometres (2,500\u00a0mi) and a depth of up to 7 kilometres (4.3\u00a0mi). The length of Valles Marineris is equivalent to the length of Europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of Mars. By comparison, the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 446 kilometres (277\u00a0mi) long and nearly 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) deep. Valles Marineris was formed due to the swelling of the Tharsis area, which caused the crust in the area of Valles Marineris to collapse. In 2012, it was proposed that Valles Marineris is not just a graben, but a plate boundary where 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of transverse motion has occurred, making Mars a planet with possibly a two-tectonic plate arrangement.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Holes and caves[edit]\n\n\nImages from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) aboard NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter have revealed seven possible cave entrances on the flanks of the volcano Arsia Mons.[104] The caves, named after loved ones of their discoverers, are collectively known as the \"seven sisters\".[105] Cave entrances measure from 100 to 252 metres (328 to 827\u00a0ft) wide and they are estimated to be at least 73 to 96 metres (240 to 315\u00a0ft) deep. Because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves, they may extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface. \"Dena\" is the only exception; its floor is visible and was measured to be 130 metres (430\u00a0ft) deep. The interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids, UV radiation, solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet's surface.[106][107]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Mars\n\n![see caption](image)Edge-on view of Mars atmosphere by *Viking 1* probe\nMars lost its magnetosphere 4\u00a0billion years ago,[108] possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes,[109] so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer.[110] Both *Mars Global Surveyor* and *Mars Express* have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars,[108][111] and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30\u00a0Pa (0.0044\u00a0psi) on Olympus Mons to over 1,155\u00a0Pa (0.1675\u00a0psi) in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600\u00a0Pa (0.087\u00a0psi).[112] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi)[113] above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of Earth's 101.3\u00a0kPa (14.69\u00a0psi). The scale height of the atmosphere is about 10.8 kilometres (6.7\u00a0mi),[114] which is higher than Earth's 6 kilometres (3.7\u00a0mi), because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's.[115]\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water.[2][116][110] The atmosphere is quite dusty, containing particulates about 1.5 \u03bcm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface.[117] It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it.[21] The concentration of methane in the Martian atmosphere fluctuates from about 0.24 ppb during the northern winter to about 0.65 ppb during the summer.[118] Estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6 to 4 years,[119][120] so its presence indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Methane could be produced by non-biological process such as serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars,[121] or by Martian life.[122]\n\n![](image)Escaping atmosphere on Mars (carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen) by MAVEN in UV[123]\nCompared to Earth, its higher concentration of atmospheric CO2 and lower surface pressure may be why sound is attenuated more on Mars, where natural sources are rare apart from the wind. Using acoustic recordings collected by the *Perseverance* rover, researchers concluded that the speed of sound there is approximately 240\u00a0m/s for frequencies below 240\u00a0Hz, and 250\u00a0m/s for those above.[124][125]\n\n\nAuroras have been detected on Mars.[126][127][128] Because Mars lacks a global magnetic field, the types and distribution of auroras there differ from those on Earth;[129] rather than being mostly restricted to polar regions as is the case on Earth, a Martian aurora can encompass the planet.[130] In September 2017, NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled, and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, solar storm in the middle of the month.[130][131]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Mars\n\n![](image)Mars without (on left) and with a global dust storm in July 2001 (on right), as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope\nOf all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212166\u00a0\u00b0F) to highs of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) in equatorial summer.[15] The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure (about 1% that of the atmosphere of Earth), and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil.[132] The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.[133][134]\n\n\nIf Mars had an Earth-like orbit, its seasons would be similar to Earth's because its axial tilt is similar to Earth's. The comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect. Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere and winter in the north, and near aphelion when it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere and summer in the north. As a result, the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case. The summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F).[135]\n\n\nMars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System, reaching speeds of over 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph). These can vary from a storm over a small area, to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and have been shown to increase global temperature.[136]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water on Mars\n\n![](image)The ice-filled Korolev crater near Mars's north pole is estimated to hold about 2,200\u00a0km3 (530\u00a0cu\u00a0mi), comparable in volume to the Great Bear Lake.\nWater in its liquid form cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% that of Earth,[137] except at the lowest of elevations for short periods.[42][138] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[139][140] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be enough to cover the entire surface of the planet with a depth of 11 metres (36\u00a0ft).[141] Large quantities of ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of Mars. Radar data from *Mars Express* and the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* (MRO) show large quantities of ice at both poles,[142][143] and at middle latitudes.[144] The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on 31 July 2008.[145]\n\n\nLandforms visible on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet's surface. Huge linear swathes of scoured ground, known as outflow channels, cut across the surface in about 25 places. These are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers, though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava.[146][147] One of the larger examples, Ma'adim Vallis, is 700 kilometres (430\u00a0mi) long, much greater than the Grand Canyon, with a width of 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) and a depth of 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) in places. It is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in Mars's history.[148] The youngest of these channels is thought to have formed only a few million years ago.[149]\n\n\nElsewhere, particularly on the oldest areas of the Martian surface, finer-scale, dendritic networks of valleys are spread across significant proportions of the landscape. Features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by runoff resulting from precipitation in early Mars history. Subsurface water flow and groundwater sapping may play important subsidiary roles in some networks, but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases.[150]\n\n\nAlong craters and canyon walls, there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the Southern Hemisphere and face the Equator; all are poleward of 30\u00b0 latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice,[151][152] although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust.[153][154] No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active.[152] Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history.[155] Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across a large proportion of the surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.[156] Further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and goethite, both of which sometimes form in the presence of water.[157]\n\n\n\n### Polar caps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Martian polar ice caps\n\n![](image)\nNorth polar early summer water ice cap (1999); a seasonal layer of carbon dioxide ice forms in winter and disappears in summer.\n![](image)\nSouth polar midsummer ice cap (2000); the south cap has a permanent carbon dioxide ice cap covered with water ice.[158]\n\nMars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25\u201330% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice).[159] When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the *Opportunity* rover in 2004.[160]\n\n\nThe caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick. This permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by flat floored, shallow, roughly circular pits, which repeat imaging shows are expanding in some places and retreating in others.[161] The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi),[162] and contains about 1.6\u00a0million cubic kilometres (5.7\u00d71016\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of ice, which, if spread evenly on the cap, would be 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) thick.[163] (This compares to a volume of 2.85\u00a0million cubic kilometres (1.01\u00d71017\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) and a thickness of 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi).[164] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.6\u00a0million cubic km.[165] Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which a recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis effect.[166][167]\n\n\nThe seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology \u2013 especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Observations and findings of water evidence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chronology of discoveries of water on Mars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nProportion of water ice present in the upper meter of the Martian surface for lower (top) and higher (bottom) latitudes\n\nIn 2004, *Opportunity* detected the mineral jarosite. This forms only in the presence of acidic water, showing that water once existed on Mars.[170][171] The *Spirit* rover found concentrated deposits of silica in 2007 that indicated wet conditions in the past, and in December 2011, the mineral gypsum, which also forms in the presence of water, was found on the surface by NASA's Mars rover Opportunity.[172][173][174] It is estimated that the amount of water in the upper mantle of Mars, represented by hydroxyl ions contained within Martian minerals, is equal to or greater than that of Earth at 50\u2013300 parts per million of water, which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 200\u20131,000 metres (660\u20133,280\u00a0ft).[175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maps of buried ice on Mars (26 October 2023)\n![](image)Map of subsurface water ice on Mars (26 October 2023)\nOn 18 March 2013, NASA reported evidence from instruments on the *Curiosity* rover of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of \"Tintina\" rock and \"Sutton Inlier\" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like \"Knorr\" rock and \"Wernicke\" rock.[177][178] Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in), during the rover's traverse from the *Bradbury Landing* site to the *Yellowknife Bay* area in the *Glenelg* terrain.[177] In September 2015, NASA announced that they had found strong evidence of hydrated brine flows in recurring slope lineae, based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes.[179][180][181] These streaks flow downhill in Martian summer, when the temperature is above \u221223\u00a0\u00b0C, and freeze at lower temperatures.[182] These observations supported earlier hypotheses, based on timing of formation and their rate of growth, that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing just below the surface.[183] However, later work suggested that the lineae may be dry, granular flows instead, with at most a limited role for water in initiating the process.[184] A definitive conclusion about the presence, extent, and role of liquid water on the Martian surface remains elusive.[185][186]\n\n\nResearchers suspect much of the low northern plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this theory remains controversial.[187] In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of protium to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium (D/H = 9.3 \u00b1 1.7 10-4) is five to seven times the amount on Earth (D/H = 1.56 10-4), suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the *Curiosity* rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.[188] Near the northern polar cap is the 81.4 kilometres (50.6\u00a0mi) wide Korolev Crater, which the Mars Express orbiter found to be filled with approximately 2,200 cubic kilometres (530\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water ice.[189]\n\n\nIn November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior (which is 12,100 cubic kilometres[190]).[191][192] During observations from 2018 through 2021, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spotted indications of water, probably subsurface ice, in the Valles Marineris canyon system.[193]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit of Mars\n\nSee also: Timekeeping on Mars\n\n![Mars circling the Sun further and slower than Earth](image)Orbit of Mars and other Inner Solar System planets\nMars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230\u00a0million\u00a0km (143\u00a0million\u00a0mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.[194] A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.[2]\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Mars is 25.19\u00b0 relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth.[2] As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.[20]\n\n\nMars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; of the seven other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35\u00a0million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much less than that of Earth today.[195] Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years.[196]\n\n\nMars approaches Earth in a synodic period of 779.94 days. Earth orbits the Sun the closest to Mars's orbit around the Sun, and Mars orbit is the second closest to Earth after the orbit of Venus. Therefore, their closest approaches, the inferior conjunctions, are the second closest for Earth after those with Venus, and the closest for Mars to any other planet. The gravitational potential difference, and thus the delta-v needed to transfer between Mars and Earth is the second lowest for Earth and the lowest for Mars to any other planet, while transfers can possibly be optimized with Venus flybys.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Moons of Mars, Phobos (moon), and Deimos (moon)\n\n![](image)\nEnhanced-color HiRISE image of Phobos, showing a series of mostly parallel grooves and crater chains, with Stickney crater at right\n![](image)\nEnhanced-color HiRISE image of Deimos (not to scale), showing its smooth blanket of regolith\n\nMars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons, Phobos (about 22 kilometres (14\u00a0mi) in diameter) and Deimos (about 12 kilometres (7.5\u00a0mi) in diameter), which orbit close to the planet. The origin of both moons is unclear, although a popular theory states that they were asteroids captured into Martian orbit.[199]\n\n\nBoth satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall and were named after the characters Phobos (the deity of panic and fear) and Deimos (the deity of terror and dread), twins from Greek mythology who accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle.[200] Mars was the Roman equivalent to Ares. In modern Greek, the planet retains its ancient name *Ares* (Aris: *\u0386\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2*).[92]\n\n\nFrom the surface of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear different from that of the Earth's satellite, the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit\u00a0\u2013 where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation\u00a0\u2013 rises as expected in the east, but slowly. Because the orbit of Phobos is below a synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50\u00a0million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.[201]\n\n\nThe origin of the two satellites is not well understood. Their low albedo and carbonaceous chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting a capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point toward a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects, and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early in the history of Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.[202] Mars may have yet-undiscovered moons, smaller than 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330\u00a0ft) in diameter, and a dust ring is predicted to exist between Phobos and Deimos.[203]\n\n\nA third possibility for their origin as satellites of Mars is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior,[204] and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars,[205] point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's satellite. Although the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.[205] It is also possible that Phobos and Deimos were fragments of an older moon, formed by debris from a large impact on Mars, and then destroyed by a more recent impact upon the satellite.[206]\n\n\n\n## Human observations and exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Exploration of Mars and History of Mars observation\n\nThe history of observations of Mars is marked by oppositions of Mars when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.[207]\n\n\n\n### Ancient and medieval observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei was the first to see Mars via telescope.\nThe ancient Sumerians named Mars Nergal, the god of war and plague. During Sumerian times, Nergal was a minor deity of little significance, but, during later times, his main cult center was the city of Nineveh.[208] In Mesopotamian texts, Mars is referred to as the \"star of judgement of the fate of the dead\".[209] The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was also recorded by the ancient Egyptian astronomers and, by 1534 BCE, they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet.[210] By the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations of their behavior. For Mars, they knew that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. They invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets.[211][212] In Ancient Greece, the planet was known as \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.[213] Commonly, the Greek name for the planet now referred to as Mars, was Ares. It was the Romans who named the planet Mars, for their god of war, often represented by the sword and shield of the planet's namesake.[214]\n\n\nIn the fourth century BCE, Aristotle noted that Mars disappeared behind the Moon during an occultation, indicating that the planet was farther away.[215] Ptolemy, a Greek living in Alexandria,[216] attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection later called the *Almagest* (from the Arabic for \"greatest\"), which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.[217] Literature from ancient China confirms that Mars was known by Chinese astronomers by no later than the fourth century BCE.[218] In the East Asian cultures, Mars is traditionally referred to as the \"fire star\" based on the *Wuxing* system.[219][220][221]\n\n\nDuring the seventeenth century A.D., Tycho Brahe measured the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet.[222] From Brahe's observations of Mars, Kepler deduced that the planet orbited the Sun not in a circle, but in an ellipse. Moreover, Kepler showed that Mars sped up as it approached the Sun and slowed down as it moved farther away, in a manner that later physicists would explain as a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.[223]:\u200a433\u2013437 When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments.[224] The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of 13 October 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg.[225] In 1610, Mars was viewed by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope.[226] The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.[227]\n\n\n\n### Martian \"canals\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Martian canals\n\n![](image)A 1962 map of Mars published by the U.S. Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, showing canals snaking through the Martian landscape. At the time, the existence canals was still highly controversial as no close-up pictures of Mars had been taken (until Mariner 4's flyby in 1965).\nBy the 19th century, the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified. On 5 September 1877, a perihelic opposition to Mars occurred. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli used a 22-centimetre (8.7\u00a0in) telescope in Milan to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called *canali*, which were later shown to be an optical illusion. These *canali* were supposedly long, straight lines on the surface of Mars, to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term, which means \"channels\" or \"grooves\", was popularly mistranslated in English as \"canals\".[228][229]\n\n\nInfluenced by the observations, the orientalist Percival Lowell founded an observatory which had 30- and 45-centimetre (12- and 18-in) telescopes. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894, and the following less favorable oppositions. He published several books on Mars and life on the planet, which had a great influence on the public.[230][231] The *canali* were independently observed by other astronomers, like Henri Joseph Perrotin and Louis Thollon in Nice, using one of the largest telescopes of that time.[232][233]\n\n\nThe seasonal changes (consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during Martian summers) in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on Mars, and it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. As bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight *canali* were observed. During observations in 1909 by Antoniadi with an 84-centimetre (33\u00a0in) telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no *canali* were seen.[234]\n\n\n\n### Robotic exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Self-portrait of *Perseverance* rover and *Ingenuity* helicopter (left) at Wright Brothers Field, 2021\nDozens of crewless spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been sent to Mars by the Soviet Union, the United States, Europe, India, the United Arab Emirates, and China to study the planet's surface, climate, and geology.[235] NASA's *Mariner 4* was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; launched on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. *Mariner 4* detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images of another planet from deep space.[236]\n\n\nOnce spacecraft visited the planet during NASA's Mariner missions in the 1960s and 1970s, many previous concepts of Mars were radically broken. After the results of the *Viking* life-detection experiments, the hypothesis of a dead planet was generally accepted.[237] The data from *Mariner 9* and *Viking* allowed better maps of Mars to be made, and the *Mars Global Surveyor* mission, which launched in 1996 and operated until late 2006, produced complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals.[238] These maps are available online at websites including Google Mars. Both the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* and *Mars Express* continued exploring with new instruments and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with *Curiosity*.[239][240]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Mars is host to thirteen functioning spacecraft. Eight are in orbit*: 2001 Mars Odyssey*, *Mars Express*, *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter*, *MAVEN*, *ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter*, the *Hope* orbiter, and the *Tianwen-1* orbiter.[241][242] Another five are on the surface: the Mars Science Laboratory *Curiosity* rover, the *Perseverance* rover, the *Ingenuity* helicopter, the *Tianwen-1* lander, and the *Zhurong* rover.[243]\n\n\nPlanned missions to Mars include the *Rosalind Franklin* rover mission, designed to search for evidence of past life, which was intended to be launched in 2018 but has been repeatedly delayed, with a launch date pushed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more likely one sometime in 2028.[244][245][246] A current concept for a joint NASA-ESA mission to return samples from Mars would launch in 2026.[247][248]\n\n\n\n![Map of Mars](image)Interactive image map of the global topography of Mars, overlaid with the position of Martian rovers and landers.

W. Campbell at Lick Observatory observed the planet and found that \"if water vapor or oxygen occur in the atmosphere of Mars it is in quantities too small to be detected by spectroscopes then available\".[249] That observation contradicted many of the measurements of the time and was not widely accepted.[249] Campbell and V. M. Slipher repeated the study in 1909 using better instruments, but with the same results. It was not until the findings were confirmed by W. S. Adams in 1925 that the myth of the Earth-like habitability of Mars was finally broken.[249] However, even in the 1960s, articles were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem were being published as late as 1962.[250]\n\n\nThe current understanding of planetary habitability\u00a0\u2013 the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life\u00a0\u2013 favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun is estimated to extend from within the orbit of Earth to about that of Mars.[251] During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.[252]\n\n\nThe environmental conditions on Mars are a challenge to sustaining organic life: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, it has poor insulation against bombardment by the solar wind due to the absence of a magnetosphere and has insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.[253]\n\n\n\n![see caption](image)Scoop of Mars soil by *Curiosity*, October 2012\n*In situ* investigations have been performed on Mars by the *Viking* landers, *Spirit* and *Opportunity* rovers, *Phoenix* lander, and *Curiosity* rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The *Viking* probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase in CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that *Viking* may have found life.[254] Tests conducted by the *Phoenix Mars* lander have shown that the soil has an alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.[255] The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.[256]\n\n\nA 2014 analysis of Martian meteorite EETA79001 found chlorate, perchlorate, and nitrate ions in sufficiently high concentrations to suggest that they are widespread on Mars. UV and X-ray radiation would turn chlorate and perchlorate ions into other, highly reactive oxychlorines, indicating that any organic molecules would have to be buried under the surface to survive.[257]\n\n\nScientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which is thought to have originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15\u00a0million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.[258] Small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.[259][260] Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinite.[121] Impact glass, formed by the impact of meteors, which on Earth can preserve signs of life, has also been found on the surface of the impact craters on Mars.[261][262] Likewise, the glass in impact craters on Mars could have preserved signs of life, if life existed at the site.[263][264][265]\n\n\n\n### Human mission proposals[edit]\n\n\nSeveral plans for a human mission to Mars have been proposed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, but none have come to fruition. The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to study the feasibility of a crewed Mars mission in the early 2030s; the resulting report eventually concluded that this would be unfeasible.[266][267] In addition, in 2021, China was planning to send a crewed Mars mission in 2033.[268] Privately held companies such as SpaceX have also proposed plans to send humans to Mars, with the eventual goal to settle on the planet.[269] The moon Phobos has been proposed as an anchor point for a space elevator.[270]\n\n\n\n## Viewing from Earth[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astronomy on Mars\n![see caption](image)Mars seen through an 16-inch amateur telescope, at 2020 opposition\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Mars is +0.71 with a standard deviation of 1.05.[18] Because the orbit of Mars is eccentric, the magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from about \u22123.0 to \u22121.4.[271] The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.86 when the planet is near aphelion and in conjunction with the Sun.[18] At its brightest, Mars (along with Jupiter) is second only to Venus in apparent brightness.[18] Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. Mars is usually close enough for particularly good viewing once or twice at 15-year or 17-year intervals.[272] As Mars approaches opposition, it begins a period of retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping curve with respect to the background stars. This retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak apparent brightness in the middle of this interval.[273]\n\n\nThe point at which Mars's geocentric longitude is 180\u00b0 different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of its closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and 103\u00a0million\u00a0km (34 and 64\u00a0million\u00a0mi) due to the planets' elliptical orbits, which causes comparable variation in angular size.[274][275] The most recent Mars opposition occurred on 8 December 2022, at a distance of about 82\u00a0million\u00a0km (51\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[276] The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its synodic period, is 780 days; but the number of days between successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.[196]\n\n\nMars comes into opposition from Earth every 2.1 years. The planets come into opposition near Mars's perihelion in 2003, 2018 and 2035, with the 2020 and 2033 events being particularly close to perihelic opposition.[207][277] Mars made its closest approach to Earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,000 years, 55,758,006\u00a0km (0.37271925\u00a0AU; 34,646,419\u00a0mi), magnitude \u22122.88, on 27 August 2003, at 09:51:13 UTC. This occurred when Mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its perihelion, making it particularly easy to see from Earth. The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on 12 September 57,617 BC, the next time being in 2287.[278] This record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches.[196]\n\n\nOptical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190\u00a0mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.[279]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mars in culture and Mars in fiction\n\nSee also: Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Mars\n\n![](image)*The War of the Worlds* by H. G. Wells, 1897, depicts an invasion of Earth by fictional Martians.\nMars is named after the Roman god of war. This association between Mars and war dates back at least to Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of war and destruction.[280][281] It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, whose famous first movement labels Mars \"the bringer of war\".[282] The planet's symbol, a circle with a spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender.[283] The symbol dates from at least the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.[284]\n\n\nThe idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians became widespread in the late 19th century. Schiaparelli's \"canali\" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works.[285] Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed \"Mars Fever\".[286] High-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars revealed no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still continues. Reminiscent of the *canali* observations, these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as \"pyramids\" and the \"Face on Mars\".[287] In his book *Cosmos*, planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: \"Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.\"[229]\n\n\nThe depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life.[288] This gave way to many science fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells's *The War of the Worlds*, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth; Ray Bradbury's *The Martian Chronicles*, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization; as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs's series *Barsoom*, C. S. Lewiss novel *Out of the Silent Planet* (1938),[289] and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.[290] Since then, depictions of Martians have also extended to animation. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin the Martian, appeared in *Haredevil Hare* (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.[291] After the *Mariner* and *Viking* spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as a lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars were abandoned; for many science-fiction authors, the new discoveries initially seemed like a constraint, but eventually the post-*Viking* knowledge of Mars became itself a source of inspiration for works like Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars* trilogy.[292]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Overview of and topical guide to Mars\n* List of missions to Mars\n* Magnetic field of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Past magnetic field of the planet Mars\n* Mineralogy of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Overview of the mineralogy of Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** The light filters are 635 nm, 546 nm, and 437 nm, which corresponds to red, green and blue\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c***  Best-fit ellipsoid\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Simon, J.L.; Bretagnon, P.; Chapront, J.; Chapront-Touz\u00e9, M.; Francou, G.; Laskar, J.

It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20\u00a0AU (778.5\u00a0Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86\u00a0years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\n\n\nJupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to comprise an outer mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.\n\n\nJupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\n\n\nSince 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\nIn both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine pantheon: Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the Romans.[17] The International Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976, and has since named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers, favourites, and descendants.[18] The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ![\u2643](image), descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, \u27e8\u01b5\u27e9, as an abbreviation for *Zeus*.[19][20]\n\n\nIn Latin, *Iovis* is the genitive case of *Iuppiter*, i.e. Jupiter. It is associated with the etymology of *Zeus* ('sky father'). The English equivalent, *Jove*, is only known to have come into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[21]\n\n\n*Jovian* is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form *jovial*, employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean 'happy' or 'merry', moods ascribed to Jupiter's influence in astrology.[22]\n\n\nThe original Greek deity *Zeus* supplies the root *zeno-*, which is used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as *zenographic*.[c]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand tack hypothesis\n See also: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nJupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System.[23] Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line: a distance from the early Sun where the temperature was sufficiently cold for volatiles such as water to condense into solids.[24] The planet began as a solid core, which then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the planet must have formed before the solar nebula was fully dispersed.[25] During its formation, Jupiter's mass gradually increased until it had 20 times the mass of the Earth, approximately half of which was made up of silicates, ices and other heavy-element constituents.[23] When the proto-Jupiter grew larger than 50 Earth masses it created a gap in the solar nebula.[23] Thereafter, the growing planet reached its final mass in 3\u20134 million years.[23]\n\n\nAccording to the \"grand tack hypothesis\", Jupiter began to form at a distance of roughly 3.5\u00a0AU (520\u00a0million\u00a0km; 330\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward.[24][26] This upset the orbits of several super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively.[27] Saturn would later have begun to migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, until the two planets became captured in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5\u00a0AU (220\u00a0million\u00a0km; 140\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun.[28] This changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system to their current locations.[27] All of this happened over a period of 3\u20136 million years, with the final migration of Jupiter occurring over several hundred thousand years.[26][29] Jupiter's migration from the inner solar system eventually allowed the inner planets\u2014including Earth\u2014to form from the rubble.[30]\n\n\nThere are several unresolved issues with the grand tack hypothesis. The resulting formation timescales of terrestrial planets appear to be inconsistent with the measured elemental composition.[31] It is likely that Jupiter would have settled into an orbit much closer to the Sun if it had migrated through the solar nebula.[32] Some competing models of Solar System formation predict the formation of Jupiter with orbital properties that are close to those of the present day planet.[25] Other models predict Jupiter forming at distances much farther out, such as 18\u00a0AU (2.7\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 1.7\u00a0billion\u00a0mi).[33][34]\n\n\nAccording to the Nice model, infall of proto-Kuiper belt objects over the first 600 million years of Solar System history caused Jupiter and Saturn to migrate from their initial positions into a 1:2 resonance, which caused Saturn to shift into a higher orbit, disrupting the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, depleting the Kuiper belt, and triggering the Late Heavy Bombardment.[35]\n\n\nBased on Jupiter's composition, researchers have made the case for an initial formation outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20\u201330\u00a0AU (3.0\u20134.5\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 1.9\u20132.8\u00a0billion\u00a0mi) from the Sun, and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40\u00a0AU (6.0\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 3.7\u00a0billion\u00a0mi).[36][37] Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have, over a roughly 700,000-year period, migrated inwards to its current location.[33][34] during an epoch approximately 2\u20133\u00a0million years after the planet began to form. In this model, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.[33]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nJupiter is a gas giant, being primarily composed of gas and liquid rather than solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 142,984\u00a0km (88,846\u00a0mi) at its equator, giving it a volume 1,321 times that of the Earth.[2][38] Its average density, 1.326\u00a0g/cm3, [d] is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\nBy mass, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 76% hydrogen and 24% helium, though, because helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume.[42] The atmosphere also contains trace amounts of methane, water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds as well as fractional amounts of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur.[43] The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia.[44] Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found.[45] The interior of Jupiter contains denser materials\u2014by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.[46][47]\n\n\nThe atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula.[48] Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.[49] Jupiter's helium abundance is about 80% that of the Sun due to precipitation of these elements as helium-rich droplets, a process that happens deep in the planet's interior.[50][51]\n\n\nBased on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more of the next most common elements, including oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.[52] Those planets are known as ice giants, because the majority of their volatile compounds are in solid form.[53]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jupiter mass\n\n![see caption](image)Jupiter with its moon Europa on the left. Earth's diameter is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and 4 times larger than Europa.\nJupiter's mass is 318 times that of Earth;[2] 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is so massive that its barycentre with the Sun lies above the Sun's surface at 1.068\u00a0solar radii from the Sun's centre.[54] [55]:\u200a6 Jupiter's radius is about one tenth the radius of the Sun,[56] and its mass is one thousandth the mass of the Sun, as the densities of the two bodies are similar.[57] A \"Jupiter mass\" (MJ or MJup) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects, particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. For example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69\u00a0MJ, while the brown dwarf Gliese 229 b has a mass of 60.4\u00a0MJ.[58][59]\n\n\nTheoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had over 40% more mass, the interior would be so compressed that its volume would *decrease* despite the increasing amount of matter. For smaller changes in its mass, the radius would not change appreciably.[60] As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve.[61] The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved.[62] Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times more massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star,[63] its diameter is sufficient as the smallest red dwarf may be only slightly larger in radius than Saturn.[64]\n\n\nJupiter radiates more heat than it receives through solar radiation, due to the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism within its contracting interior.[65]:\u200a30[66] This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 1\u00a0mm (0.039\u00a0in)/yr.[67][68] At the time of its formation, Jupiter was hotter and was about twice its current diameter.[69]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Jupiter, its interior, surface features, rings, and inner moons.\nBefore the early 21st century, most scientists proposed one of two scenarios for the formation of Jupiter. If the planet accreted first as a solid body, it would consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet,[70] and an outer atmosphere consisting primarily of molecular hydrogen.[68] Alternatively, if the planet collapsed directly from the gaseous protoplanetary disk, it was expected to completely lack a core, consisting instead of a denser and denser fluid (predominantly molecular and metallic hydrogen) all the way to the centre. Data from the *Juno* mission showed that Jupiter has a diffuse core that mixes into its mantle, extending for 30\u201350% of the planet's radius, and comprising heavy elements with a combined mass 7\u201325 times the Earth.[71][72][73][74][75] This mixing process could have arisen during formation, while the planet accreted solids and gases from the surrounding nebula.[76] Alternatively, it could have been caused by an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.[77][78]\n\n\nOutside the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above molecular hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.3 MPa and critical temperature of 33\u00a0K (\u2212240.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212400.3\u00a0\u00b0F).[79] In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases\u2014hydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state. The hydrogen and helium gas extending downward from the cloud layer gradually transitions to a liquid in deeper layers, possibly resembling something akin to an ocean of liquid hydrogen and other supercritical fluids.[65]:\u200a22[80][81][82] Physically, the gas gradually becomes hotter and denser as depth increases.[83][84]\n\n\nRain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through the lower atmosphere, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere.[50][85] Calculations suggest that helium drops separate from metallic hydrogen at a radius of 60,000\u00a0km (37,000\u00a0mi) (11,000\u00a0km (6,800\u00a0mi) below the cloud tops) and merge again at 50,000\u00a0km (31,000\u00a0mi) (22,000\u00a0km (14,000\u00a0mi) beneath the clouds).[86] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur, as well as on Saturn[87] and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[88]\n\n\nThe temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily inward as the heat of planetary formation can only escape by convection.[51] At a surface depth where the atmospheric pressure level is 1\u00a0bar (0.10\u00a0MPa), the temperature is around 165\u00a0K (\u2212108\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212163\u00a0\u00b0F). The region where supercritical hydrogen changes gradually from a molecular fluid to a metallic fluid spans pressure ranges of 50\u2013400\u00a0GPa with temperatures of 5,000\u20138,400\u00a0K (4,730\u20138,130\u00a0\u00b0C; 8,540\u201314,660\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively. The temperature of Jupiter's diluted core is estimated to be 20,000\u00a0K (19,700\u00a0\u00b0C; 35,500\u00a0\u00b0F) with a pressure of around 4,000\u00a0GPa.[89]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Jupiter\n\n![](image)Timelapse of Jupiter's cloud system moving over the course of one month (photographed during Voyager 1 flyby in 1979)\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter extends to a depth of 3,000\u00a0km (2,000\u00a0mi) below the cloud layers.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Cloud layers[edit]\n\n\nJupiter is perpetually covered with clouds of ammonia crystals, which may contain ammonium hydrosulfide as well.[90] The clouds are located in the tropopause layer of the atmosphere, forming bands at different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are subdivided into lighter-hued *zones* and darker *belts*. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100 metres per second (360\u00a0km/h; 220\u00a0mph) are common in zonal jet streams.[91] The zones have been observed to vary in width, colour and intensity from year to year, but they have remained stable enough for scientists to name them.[55]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of Jupiter's south pole\n![](image)\nEnhanced colour view of Jupiter's southern storms\n\nThe cloud layer is about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) deep, and consists of at least two decks of ammonia clouds: a thin clearer region on top with a thick lower deck. There may be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia clouds, as suggested by flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter.[92] These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on Earth.[93] The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the interior.[94] The Juno mission revealed the presence of \"shallow lightning\" which originates from ammonia-water clouds relatively high in the atmosphere.[95] These discharges carry \"mushballs\" of water-ammonia slushes covered in ice, which fall deep into the atmosphere.[96] Upper-atmospheric lightning has been observed in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, bright flashes of light that last around 1.4 milliseconds. These are known as \"elves\" or \"sprites\" and appear blue or pink due to the hydrogen.[97][98]\n\n\nThe orange and brown colours in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change colour when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be made up of phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.[65]:\u200a39[99] These colourful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer clouds of the lower deck. The light-coloured zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallising ammonia that hides the chromophores from view.[100]\n\n\nJupiter has a low axial tilt, thus making it that the poles always receive less solar radiation than the planet's equatorial region. Convection within the interior of the planet transports energy to the poles, balancing out temperatures at the cloud layer.[55]:\u200a54\n\n\n\n#### Great Red Spot and other vortices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Close-up of the Great Red Spot imaged by the *Juno* spacecraft in April 2018\nA well-known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot,[101] a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22\u00b0 south of the equator. It was first observed in 1831,[102] and possibly as early as 1665.[103][104] Images by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown two more \"red spots\" adjacent to the Great Red Spot.[105][106] The storm is visible through Earth-based telescopes with an aperture of 12\u00a0cm or larger.[107] The oval object rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about six days.[108] The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) above the surrounding cloud tops.[109] The Spot's composition and the source of its red colour remain uncertain, although photodissociated ammonia reacting with acetylene is a likely explanation.[110]\n\n\nThe Great Red Spot is larger than the Earth.[111] Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and will be a permanent feature of the planet.[112] However, it has significantly decreased in size since its discovery. Initial observations in the late 1800s showed it to be approximately 41,000\u00a0km (25,500\u00a0mi) across. By the time of the *Voyager* flybys in 1979, the storm had a length of 23,300\u00a0km (14,500\u00a0mi) and a width of approximately 13,000\u00a0km (8,000\u00a0mi).[113] *Hubble* observations in 1995 showed it had decreased in size to 20,950\u00a0km (13,020\u00a0mi), and observations in 2009 showed the size to be 17,910\u00a0km (11,130\u00a0mi). As of 2015[update], the storm was measured at approximately 16,500 by 10,940\u00a0km (10,250 by 6,800\u00a0mi),[113] and was decreasing in length by about 930\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi) per year.[111][114] In October 2021, a *Juno* flyby mission measured the depth of the Great Red Spot, putting it at around 300\u2013500 kilometres (190\u2013310\u00a0mi).[115]\n\n\n*Juno* missions show that there are several polar cyclone groups at Jupiter's poles. The northern group contains nine cyclones, with a large one in the centre and eight others around it, while its southern counterpart also consists of a centre vortex but is surrounded by five large storms and a single smaller one for a total of 7 storms.[116][117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Formation of Oval BA from three white ovals\nIn 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature\u2014these three smaller white ovals were formed in 1939\u20131940. The merged feature was named Oval BA. It has since increased in intensity and changed from white to red, earning it the nickname \"Little Red Spot\".[118][119]\n\n\nIn April 2017, a \"Great Cold Spot\" was discovered in Jupiter's thermosphere at its north pole. This feature is 24,000\u00a0km (15,000\u00a0mi) across, 12,000\u00a0km (7,500\u00a0mi) wide, and 200\u00a0\u00b0C (360\u00a0\u00b0F) cooler than surrounding material. While this spot changes form and intensity over the short term, it has maintained its general position in the atmosphere for more than 15 years. It may be a giant vortex similar to the Great Red Spot, and appears to be quasi-stable like the vortices in Earth's thermosphere. This feature may be formed by interactions between charged particles generated from Io and the strong magnetic field of Jupiter, resulting in a redistribution of heat flow.[120]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Magnetosphere of Jupiter\n\n![](image)\nAurorae on the north and south poles  \n(animation)\n![](image)\nAurorae on the north pole  \n(Hubble)\n![](image)\nInfrared view of southern lights  \n(Jovian IR Mapper)\n\nJupiter's magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in the Solar System,[100] with a dipole moment of 4.170 gauss (0.4170\u00a0mT) that is tilted at an angle of 10.31\u00b0 to the pole of rotation. The surface magnetic field strength varies from 2 gauss (0.20\u00a0mT) up to 20 gauss (2.0\u00a0mT).[121] This field is thought to be generated by eddy currents\u2014swirling movements of conducting materials\u2014within the liquid, metallic hydrogen core. At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath\u2014a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from solar wind.[65]:\u200a69\n\n\nThe volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide, forming a gas torus along its orbit. The gas is ionized in Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet, causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of a magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature, with short, superimposed bursts in the range of 0.6\u201330\u00a0MHz that are detectable from Earth with consumer-grade shortwave radio receivers.[122][123] As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfv\u00e9n waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the radio output of the Sun.[124]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Jupiter\n\nJupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.[125] These rings appear to be made of dust, whereas Saturn's rings are made of ice.[65]:\u200a65 The main ring is most likely made out of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis, which is drawn into Jupiter because of the planet's strong gravitational influence. New material is added by additional impacts.[126] In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea are believed to produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring.[126] There is evidence of a fourth ring that may consist of collisional debris from Amalthea that is strung along the same moon's orbit.[127]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![see caption](image)Orbit of Jupiter and other outer Solar System planets\nJupiter is the only planet whose barycentre with the Sun lies outside the volume of the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius.[128][129] The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778\u00a0million\u00a0km (5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86\u00a0years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance.[130] The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30\u00b0 compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.049, Jupiter is slightly over 75\u00a0million\u00a0km nearer the Sun at perihelion than aphelion,[2] which means that its orbit is nearly circular. This low eccentricity is at odds with exoplanet discoveries, which have revealed Jupiter-sized planets with very high eccentricities. Models suggest this may be due to there being only two giant planets in our Solar System, as the presence of a third or more giant planets tends to induce larger eccentricities.[131]\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small, only 3.13\u00b0, so its seasons are insignificant compared to those of Earth and Mars.[132]\n\n\nJupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an amateur telescope. Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5\u00a0minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere.[133] The planet is an oblate spheroid, meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles.[84] On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is 9,276\u00a0km (5,764\u00a0mi) longer than the polar diameter.[2]\n\n\nThree systems are used as frames of reference for tracking planetary rotation, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies to latitudes from 7\u00b0\u00a0N to 7\u00b0\u00a0S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50\u00a0m 30.0s. System II applies at latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55\u00a0m 40.6s.[134] System III was defined by radio astronomers and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.[135]\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![see caption](image)Jupiter and four Galilean moons seen through an amateur telescope\nJupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon, and Venus),[100] although at opposition Mars can appear brighter than Jupiter. Depending on Jupiter's position with respect to the Earth, it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as \u22122.94 at opposition down to \u22121.66 during conjunction with the Sun.[14] The mean apparent magnitude is \u22122.20 with a standard deviation of 0.33.[14] The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 30.5 arc seconds.[2] Favourable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through the perihelion of its orbit, bringing it closer to Earth.[136] Near opposition, Jupiter will appear to go into retrograde motion for a period of about 121 days, moving backward through an angle of 9.9\u00b0 before returning to prograde movement.[137]\n\n\nBecause the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth is always less than 11.5\u00b0; thus, Jupiter always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained.[138] A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A larger telescope with an aperture of 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315\u00a0cm) will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.[139][140]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-telescopic research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model in the *Almagest* of the longitudinal motion of Jupiter (\u2609) relative to Earth (\ud83d\udf28)\nObservation of Jupiter dates back to at least the Babylonian astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC.[141] The ancient Chinese knew Jupiter as the \"*Su\u00ec* Star\" (*Su\u00ecx\u012bng* \u6b72\u661f) and established their cycle of 12 earthly branches based on the approximate number of years it takes Jupiter to rotate around the Sun; the Chinese language still uses its name (simplified as \u6b72) when referring to years of age. By the 4th century BC, these observations had developed into the Chinese zodiac,[142] and each year became associated with a Tai Sui star and god controlling the region of the heavens opposite Jupiter's position in the night sky. These beliefs survive in some Taoist religious practices and in the East Asian zodiac's twelve animals. The Chinese historian Xi Zezong has claimed that Gan De, an ancient Chinese astronomer,[143] reported a small star \"in alliance\" with the planet,[144] which may indicate a sighting of one of Jupiter's moons with the unaided eye. If true, this would predate Galileo's discovery by nearly two millennia.[145][146]\n\n\nA 2016 paper reports that trapezoidal rule was used by Babylonians before 50 BCE for integrating the velocity of Jupiter along the ecliptic.[147] In his 2nd century work the *Almagest*, the Hellenistic astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus constructed a geocentric planetary model based on deferents and epicycles to explain Jupiter's motion relative to Earth, giving its orbital period around Earth as 4332.38\u00a0days, or 11.86\u00a0years.[148]\n\n\n\n### Ground-based telescope research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo's drawings of Jupiter and its \"Medicean Stars\" from *Sidereus Nuncius*\nIn 1610, Italian polymath Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons) using a telescope. This is thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. Just one day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614.[149] It was Marius's names for the major moons, however, that stuck: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The discovery was a major point in favour of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory led to him being tried and condemned by the Inquisition.[150]\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1639, the Neapolitan optician Francesco Fontana tested a 22-palm telescope of his own making and discovered the characteristic bands of the planet's atmosphere.[151]\n\n\nDuring the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new telescope to discover spots in Jupiter's atmosphere, observe that the planet appeared oblate, and estimate its rotation period.[152] In 1692, Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes a differential rotation.[153]\n\n\nThe Great Red Spot may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.[154] The Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878.[155] It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century.[156]\n\n\nBoth Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of Jupiter's moons, which allowed predictions of when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, Cassini observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17\u00a0minutes later than expected. Ole R\u00f8mer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected),[47] and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.[157][158]\n\n\nIn 1892, E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch (910\u00a0mm) refractor at Lick Observatory in California. This moon was later named Amalthea.[159] It was the last planetary moon to be discovered directly by a visual observer through a telescope.[160] An additional eight satellites were discovered before the flyby of the Voyager 1 probe in 1979.[e]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jupiter viewed in infrared by JWST  \n(July 14, 2022)\nIn 1932, Rupert Wildt identified absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of Jupiter.[161] Three long-lived anticyclonic features called \"white ovals\" were observed in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.[162]\n\n\n\n### Radiotelescope research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Image of Jupiter and its radiation belts in radio\nIn 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin discovered that Jupiter emits bursts of radio waves at a frequency of 22.2\u00a0MHz.[65]:\u200a36 The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they used this information to determine a more precise value for Jupiter's rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) lasting less than a hundredth of a second.[163]\n\n\nScientists have discovered three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter:\n\n\n\n* Decametric radio bursts (with a wavelength of tens of metres) vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are influenced by the interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.[164]\n* Decimetric radio emission (with wavelengths measured in centimetres) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959.[65]:\u200a36 The origin of this signal is a torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator, which generates cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.[165]\n* Thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere of Jupiter.[65]:\u200a43\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Jupiter\n\nJupiter has been visited by automated spacecraft since 1973, when the space probe *Pioneer 10* passed close enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about its properties and phenomena.[166][167] Missions to Jupiter are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Entering a Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter from low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of 6.3\u00a0km/s,[168] which is comparable to the 9.7\u00a0km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[169] Gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Flyby missions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spacecraft\n | Closest approach\n | Distance (km)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *Pioneer 10* | December 3, 1973\n | 130,000\n |\n| *Pioneer 11* | December 4, 1974\n | 34,000\n |\n| *Voyager 1* | March 5, 1979\n | 349,000\n |\n| *Voyager 2* | July 9, 1979\n | 570,000\n |\n| *Ulysses* | February 8, 1992[171] | 408,894\n |\n| February 4, 2004[171] | 120,000,000\n |\n| *Cassini* | December 30, 2000\n | 10,000,000\n |\n| *New Horizons* | February 28, 2007\n | 2,304,535\n |\n\n\nBeginning in 1973, several spacecraft performed planetary flyby manoeuvres that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter and the amount of polar flattening.[55]:\u200a47[172]\n\n\nSix years later, the Voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Spot had changed hues since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, which were found to come from erupting volcanoes on the moon's surface. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.[55]:\u200a87[173]\n\n\nThe next mission to encounter Jupiter was the *Ulysses* solar probe. In February 1992, it performed a flyby manoeuvre to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft studied Jupiter's magnetosphere, although it had no cameras to photograph the planet. The spacecraft passed by Jupiter six years later, this time at a much greater distance.[171]\n\n\nIn 2000, the *Cassini* probe flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn, and provided higher-resolution images.[174]\n\n\nThe *New Horizons* probe flew by Jupiter in 2007 for a gravity assist en route to Pluto.[175] The probe's cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail.[176]\n\n\n\n#### *Galileo* mission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Galileo (spacecraft)\n\n![](image)*Galileo* in preparation for mating with the rocket, 1989\nThe first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the *Galileo* mission, which reached the planet on December 7, 1995.[61] It remained in orbit for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 when it collided with Jupiter in 1994. Some of the goals for the mission were thwarted due to a malfunction in *Galileo'*s high-gain antenna.[177]\n\n\nA 340-kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.[61] It parachuted through 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) of the atmosphere at a speed of about 2,575\u00a0km/h (1600\u00a0mph)[61] and collected data for 57.6\u00a0minutes until the spacecraft was destroyed.[178] The *Galileo* orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003. NASA destroyed the spacecraft to avoid any possibility of the spacecraft crashing into and possibly contaminating the moon Europa, which may harbour life.[177]\n\n\nData from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90% of Jupiter's atmosphere.[61] The recorded temperature was more than 300\u00a0\u00b0C (570\u00a0\u00b0F) and the windspeed measured more than 644\u00a0km/h (>400\u00a0mph) before the probes vaporized.[61]\n\n\n\n#### *Juno* mission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Juno (spacecraft)\n\n![see caption](image)*Juno* preparing for testing in a rotation stand, 2011\nNASA's *Juno* mission arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016 with the goal of studying the planet in detail from a polar orbit. The spacecraft was originally intended to orbit Jupiter thirty-seven times over a period of twenty months.[179][73][180] During the mission, the spacecraft will be exposed to high levels of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere, which may cause future failure of certain instruments.[181] On August 27, 2016, the spacecraft completed its first fly-by of Jupiter and sent back the first-ever images of Jupiter's north pole.[182]\n\n\n*Juno* completed 12 orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.[183] In June of that year, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021, and in January of that year the mission was extended to September 2025 with four lunar flybys: one of Ganymede, one of Europa, and two of Io.[184][185] When *Juno* reaches the end of the mission, it will perform a controlled deorbit and disintegrate into Jupiter's atmosphere. This will avoid the risk of collision with Jupiter's moons.[186][187]\n\n\n\n#### Cancelled missions and future plans[edit]\n\n\nThere is great interest in missions to study Jupiter's larger icy moons, which may have subsurface liquid oceans.[188] Funding difficulties have delayed progress, causing NASA's *JIMO* (*Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter*) to be cancelled in 2005.[189] A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA/ESA mission called EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter.[190] However, the ESA formally ended the partnership in April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection.[191] These plans have been realized as the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), launched on April 14, 2023,[192] followed by NASA's *Europa Clipper* mission, scheduled for launch in 2024.[193]\n\n\n\nViews of Jupiter from JunoCam\nOther proposed missions include the Chinese National Space Administration's *Tianwen-4* mission which aims to launch an orbiter to the Jovian system and possibly Callisto around 2035,[194] and CNSA's *Interstellar Express*[195] and NASA's *Interstellar Probe*,[196] which would both use Jupiter's gravity to help them reach the edges of the heliosphere.\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Jupiter\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons and Satellite system (astronomy)\n\nJupiter has 95 known natural satellites,[7] and it is likely that this number would go up in the future due to improved instrumentation.[197] Of these, 79 are less than 10\u00a0km in diameter.[7] The four largest moons are Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa (in order of decreasing size), collectively known as the \"Galilean moons\", and are visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night.[198]\n\n\n\n### Galilean moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Galilean moons\n\nThe moons discovered by Galileo\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto\u2014are among the largest in the Solar System. The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbours at the same point in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.[199]\n\n\nThe eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. The friction created by this tidal flexing generates heat in the interior of the moons.[200] This is seen most dramatically in the volcanic activity of Io (which is subject to the strongest tidal forces),[200] and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface, which indicates recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior.[201]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nThe Galilean moons compared to the Earth's Moon\n| Name\n | IPA | Diameter\n | Mass\n | Orbital radius\n | Orbital period\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| km\n | *D*\u263e | kg\n | *M*\u263e | km\n | *a*\u263e | days\n | *T*\u263e |\n| Io | /\u02c8a\u026a.o\u028a/ | 3,643\n | 1.05\n | 8.9\u00d71022 | 1.20\n | 421,700\n | 1.10\n | 1.77\n | 0.07\n |\n| Europa | /j\u028a\u02c8ro\u028ap\u0259/ | 3,122\n | 0.90\n | 4.8\u00d71022 | 0.65\n | 671,034\n | 1.75\n | 3.55\n | 0.13\n |\n| Ganymede | /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6nimi\u02d0d/ | 5,262\n | 1.50\n | 14.8\u00d71022 | 2.00\n | 1,070,412\n | 2.80\n | 7.15\n | 0.26\n |\n| Callisto | /k\u0259\u02c8l\u026asto\u028a/ | 4,821\n | 1.40\n | 10.8\u00d71022 | 1.50\n | 1,882,709\n | 4.90\n | 16.69\n | 0.61\n |\n\n |\n| ![The Galilean moons.

Jupiter's moons are currently divided into several different groups, although there are several moons which are not part of any group.[203]\n\n\nThe eight innermost regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator, are thought to have formed alongside Jupiter, whilst the remainder are irregular moons and are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. The irregular moons within each group may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.[204][205]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Regular moons\n |\n| --- |\n| Inner group | The inner group of four small moons all have diameters of less than 200\u00a0km, orbit at radii less than 200,000\u00a0km, and have orbital inclinations of less than half a degree.[206] |\n| Galilean\u00a0moons[207] | These four moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei and by Simon Marius in parallel, orbit between 400,000 and 2,000,000\u00a0km, and are some of the largest moons in the Solar System.\n |\n| Irregular moons\n |\n| Himalia group | A tightly clustered group of prograde-orbiting moons with orbits around 11,000,000\u201312,000,000\u00a0km from Jupiter.[208] |\n| Carpo group | A sparsely populated group of small moons with highly inclined prograde orbits around 16,000,000\u201317,000,000\u00a0km from Jupiter.[7] |\n| Ananke\u00a0group | This group of retrograde-orbiting moons has rather indistinct borders, averaging 21,276,000\u00a0km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 149 degrees.[205] |\n| Carme group | A tightly clustered group of retrograde-orbiting moons that averages 23,404,000\u00a0km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 165 degrees.[205] |\n| Pasiphae group | A dispersed and only vaguely distinct retrograde group that covers all the outermost moons.[209] |\n\n\n## Interaction with the Solar System[edit]\n\n\nAs the most massive of the eight planets, the gravitational influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. With the exception of Mercury, the orbits of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane. The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter,[210] and the planet may have been responsible for the purported Late Heavy Bombardment in the inner Solar System's history.[211]\n\n\nIn addition to its moons, Jupiter's gravitational field controls numerous asteroids that have settled around the Lagrangian points that precede and follow the planet in its orbit around the Sun. These are known as the Trojan asteroids, and are divided into Greek and Trojan \"camps\" to honour the *Iliad*. The first of these, 588 Achilles, was discovered by Max Wolf in 1906; since then more than two thousand have been discovered.[212] The largest is 624 Hektor.[213]\n\n\nThe Jupiter family is defined as comets that have a semi-major axis smaller than Jupiter's; most short-period comets belong to this group. Members of the Jupiter family are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close encounters with Jupiter, they are perturbed into orbits with a smaller period, which then becomes circularized by regular gravitational interactions with the Sun and Jupiter.[214]\n\n\n\n### Impacts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Impact events on Jupiter\n\n![](image)Brown spots mark Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9's impact sites on Jupiter\nJupiter has been called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner[215] because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner Solar System. There are more impacts on Jupiter, such as comets, than on any other planet in the Solar System.[216] For example, Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.[61] In the past, scientists believed that Jupiter partially shielded the inner system from cometary bombardment.[61] However, computer simulations in 2008 suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them.[217] This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt, while others believe that Jupiter protects Earth from the Oort cloud.[218]\n\n\nIn July 1994, the Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 comet collided with Jupiter.[219][220] The impacts were closely observed by observatories around the world, including the Hubble Space Telescope and *Galileo* spacecraft.[221][222][223][224] The event was widely covered by the media.[225]\n\n\nSurveys of early astronomical records and drawings produced eight examples of potential impact observations between 1664 and 1839. However, a 1997 review determined that these observations had little or no possibility of being the results of impacts. Further investigation by this team revealed a dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 may have been an impact scar.[226]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jupiter in fiction and Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Jupiter\n\n![](image)Jupiter, woodcut from a 1550 edition of Guido Bonatti's *Liber Astronomiae*\nThe existence of the planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low.[227] To the Babylonians, this planet represented their god Marduk,[228] chief of their pantheon from the Hammurabi period.[229] They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.[228]\n\n\nThe mythical Greek name for this planet is *Zeus* (\u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), also referred to as *Dias* (\u0394\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek.[230] The ancient Greeks knew the planet as Phaethon (\u03a6\u03b1\u03ad\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd), meaning \"shining one\" or \"blazing star\".[231][232] The Greek myths of Zeus from the Homeric period showed particular similarities to certain Near-Eastern gods, including the Semitic El and Baal, the Sumerian Enlil, and the Babylonian god Marduk.[233] The association between the planet and the Greek deity Zeus was drawn from Near Eastern influences and was fully established by the fourth century BCE, as documented in the *Epinomis* of Plato and his contemporaries.[234]\n\n\nThe god Jupiter is the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and he is the principal god of Roman mythology. The Romans originally called Jupiter the \"star of Jupiter\" (*Iuppiter Stella*), as they believed it to be sacred to its namesake god. This name comes from the Proto-Indo-European vocative compound \\**Dy\u0113u-p\u0259ter* (nominative: \\**Dy\u0113us-p\u0259t\u0113r*, meaning \"Father Sky-God\", or \"Father Day-God\").[235] As the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter was the god of thunder, lightning, and storms, and was appropriately called the god of light and sky.[236]\n\n\nIn Vedic astrology, Hindu astrologers named the planet after Brihaspati, the religious teacher of the gods, and often called it \"Guru\", which means the \"Teacher\".[237][238] In Central Asian Turkic myths, Jupiter is called *Erendiz* or *Erent\u00fcz*, from *eren* (of uncertain meaning) and *yultuz* (\"star\"). The Turks calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days. They believed that some social and natural events connected to Erent\u00fcz's movements on the sky.[239] The Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese called it the \"wood star\" (Chinese: \u6728\u661f; pinyin: *m\u00f9x\u012bng*), based on the Chinese Five Elements.[240][241][242] In China it became known as the \"Year-star\" (Sui-sing) as Chinese astronomers noted that it jumped one zodiac constellation each year (with corrections). In some ancient Chinese writings the years were named, at least in principle, in correlation with the Jovian zodiac signs.[243]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Infrared view of Jupiter, imaged by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai\u02bbi, January 11, 2017](image)\n\nInfrared view of Jupiter, imaged by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai\u02bbi, January 11, 2017\n* ![Jupiter imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, January 11, 2017](image)\n\nJupiter imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, January 11, 2017\n* ![Ultraviolet view of Jupiter by Hubble, January 11, 2017[244]](image)\n\nUltraviolet view of Jupiter by Hubble, January 11, 2017[244]\n* ![Jupiter and Europa, taken by Hubble on 25 August 2020, when the planet was 653 million kilometres from Earth.[245]](image)\n\nJupiter and Europa, taken by Hubble on 25 August 2020, when the planet was 653 million kilometres from Earth.[245]\n* ![Infrared photo by James Webb Space Telescope, August 2022[246]](image)\n\nInfrared photo by James Webb Space Telescope, August 2022[246]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Overview of and topical guide to Jupiter\n* Eccentric Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Jovian planet that orbits its star in an eccentric orbit\n* Hot Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Class of high mass planets orbiting close to a star\n* Super-Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Class of planets with more mass than Jupiter\n* Jovian\u2013Plutonian gravitational effect\u00a0\u2013 Astronomical hoax\n* List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n2. **^** Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n3. **^** See for example: \"IAUC 2844: Jupiter; 1975h\".

It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[28][29][30]\n\n\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[31] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).\n\n\nThe planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons[32] are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[33]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\nSaturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (![\u2644](image)) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho ligature with a horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for *\u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2* (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet (![](image)).[34]\nIt later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize this pagan symbol. \n\n\nThe Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, *S\u0101turni di\u0113s* (\"Saturn's Day\"), for the planet Saturn.[35]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nSaturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core.[36] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than its polar radius: 60,268\u00a0km versus 54,364\u00a0km.[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96\u00a0m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36\u00a0km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[37]\n\n\nSaturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water\u2014about 30% less.[38] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69\u00a0g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass,[39] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Saturn, to scaleDespite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01\u00a0g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.[40]\n\n\nStandard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles.[41] Analysis of the distortion shows that Saturn is substantially more centrally condensed than Jupiter and therefore contains a significantly larger amount of material denser than hydrogen near its centre. Saturn's central regions contain about 50% hydrogen by mass, while Jupiter's contain approximately 67% hydrogen.[42]\n\n\nThis core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9\u201322 times the mass of Earth,[43][44] which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000\u00a0km.[45] However, measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to about 17 Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire radius.[46] This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000\u00a0km and consists of gas.[47][48][49]\n\n\nSaturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700\u00a0\u00b0C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be the generation of heat through the \"raining out\" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.[50][51] These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[41] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter[52] and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[53]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nThe outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.[54] The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.[41] The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19\u201331 times the mass of Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.[55]\n\n\nTrace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.[56][57][58] The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water.[59] Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.[58] *Cassini* observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes, nicknamed the \"String of Pearls\". These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Cloud layers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A global storm girdles the planet in 2011. The storm passes around the planet, such that the storm's head (bright area) passes its tail.\nSaturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the *Voyager* spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.[61]\n\n\nThe composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with temperatures in the range of 100\u2013160\u00a0K and pressures extending between 0.5\u20132 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185 to 270\u00a0K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3\u20136 bar with temperatures of 190\u2013235\u00a0K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar and temperatures are 270\u2013330\u00a0K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.[62]\n\n\nSaturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the *Voyager* encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot, a short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice.[63] Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the best observed.[64] The latest giant storm was observed in 2010. In 2015, researchers used Very Large Array telescope to study Saturnian atmosphere, and reported that they found \"long-lasting signatures of all mid-latitude giant storms, a mixture of equatorial storms up to hundreds of years old, and potentially an unreported older storm at 70\u00b0N\".[65]\n\n\nThe winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. *Voyager* data indicate peak easterly winds of 500\u00a0m/s (1,800\u00a0km/h).[66] In images from the *Cassini* spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering.[67] Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System.[68] Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally \u2212185\u00a0\u00b0C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as \u2212122\u00a0\u00b0C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Hexagonal cloud patterns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saturn's hexagon\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSaturn's north and south pole in infrared\n\nA persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78\u00b0N was first noted in the *Voyager* images.[69][70][71] The sides of the hexagon are each about 14,500\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) long, which is longer than the diameter of the Earth.[72] The entire structure rotates with a period of 10h 39m 24s (the same period as that of the planet's radio emissions) which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn's interior.[73] The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere.[74] The pattern's origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.[75][76]\n\n\nHST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream, but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave.[77] NASA reported in November 2006 that *Cassini* had observed a \"hurricane-like\" storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall.[78][79] Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth. For example, images from the *Galileo* spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.[80]\n\n\nThe south pole storm may have been present for billions of years.[81] This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth, and it has winds of 550\u00a0km/h.[81]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Magnetosphere of Saturn\n\n![](image)Auroral lights at Saturn's north pole\nSaturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape\u2014a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator\u20140.2\u00a0gauss (\u00b5T)\u2014is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field.[31] As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's.[82] When *Voyager 2* entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1\u00a0million km (712,000\u00a0mi),[83] although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days.[84] Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter\u2014by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo.[82] This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere.[31] Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.[85]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Animation of Saturn and the Solar System's outer planets orbiting around the Sun\n![](image)Simulated appearance of Saturn as seen from Earth (at opposition) during an orbit of Saturn, 2001\u20132029The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4\u00a0billion kilometers (9\u00a0AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68\u00a0km/s,[6] it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about 29+1\u20442\u00a0years)[86] to finish one revolution around the Sun.[6] As a consequence, it forms a near 5:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.[87] The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48\u00b0 relative to the orbital plane of the Earth.[6] The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957\u00a0AU, on average.[6][88] The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude, and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).\n\n\nAstronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. *System\u00a0I* has a period of 10h 14m 00s (844.3\u00b0/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to *System\u00a0I*. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as *System\u00a0II* and have been assigned a rotation period of 10h 38m 25.4s (810.76\u00b0/d). *System\u00a0III* refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet detected by *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2*,[89] System\u00a0III has a rotation period of 10h 39m 22.4s (810.8\u00b0/d). System\u00a0III has largely superseded System\u00a0II.[90]\n\n\nA precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, *Cassini* found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10h 45m 45s \u00b1 36s.[91][92] An estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the *Cassini*, *Voyager* and *Pioneer* probes is 10h 32m 35s.[93] Studies of the planet's C Ring yield a rotation period of 10h 33m 38s + 1m 52s  \n\u2212 1m 19s\u2009.[17][18]\n\n\nIn March 2007, it was found that the variation in radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.[94][95][96]\n\n\nAn apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable Lagrangian points, designated L4 and L5, located at 60\u00b0 angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have been discovered for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Orbital resonance mechanisms, including secular resonance, are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.[97]\n\n\n\n## Natural satellites[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Saturn\n\n![](image)Artist conception of Saturn, its rings and major icy moons\u2014from Mimas to Rhea\nSaturn has 146 known moons, 63 of which have formal names.[12][11] It is estimated that there are other 100\u00b130 outer irregular moons larger than 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) in diameter.[98]\nIn addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40\u2013500 meters in Saturn's rings,[99] which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.[100] Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own,[101] along with a tenuous atmosphere.[102][103][104]\n\n\nMany of the other moons are small: 131 are less than 50\u00a0km in diameter.[105] Traditionally, most of Saturn's moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology. Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere,[106][107] in which a complex organic chemistry occurs. It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes.[108][109]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life.[110] On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.[111]\n\n\nSaturn's moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets,[112] has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life.[113][114][115][116] Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite's salt-rich particles having an \"ocean-like\" composition that indicates most of Enceladus's expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water.[117][118][119] A 2015 flyby by *Cassini* through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the A Ring, which was imaged by *Cassini* on 15 April 2013.[121]\n\n\n\n## Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Saturn\n\n![](image)The rings of Saturn (imaged here by *Cassini* in 2007) are the most massive and conspicuous in the Solar System.[48]\nSaturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique.[48] The rings extend from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers (4,120 to 75,000\u00a0mi) outward from Saturn's equator and average approximately 20 meters (66\u00a0ft) in thickness. They are composed predominantly of water ice, with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately 7% amorphous carbon.[122] The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10\u00a0m.[123] While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.\n\n\nThere are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn, for which a research team at MIT has proposed the name \"Chrysalis\".[124] The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn was formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.[125][126][127][128] The water abundance of the rings varies radially, with the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water. This abundance variance may be explained by meteor bombardment.[129]\n\n\nBeyond the main rings, at a distance of 12\u00a0million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring. It is tilted at an angle of 27\u00b0 to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.[130]\n\n\nSome of the moons of Saturn, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out.[131] Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.[132]\n\n\nIn September 2023, astronomers reported studies suggesting that the rings of Saturn may have resulted from the collision of two moons \"a few hundred million years ago\".[133][134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNatural-color mosaic of *Cassini* narrow-angle camera images of the unilluminated side of Saturn's D, C, B, A and F rings (left to right) taken on May 9, 2007 (distances are to the planet's center).\n\n## History of observation and exploration[edit]\n\n\nThe observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases: (1) pre-modern observations with the naked eye, (2) telescopic observations from Earth beginning in the 17th century, and (3) visitation by space probes, in orbit or on flyby. In the 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth (including Earth-orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope) and, until its 2017 retirement, from the *Cassini* orbiter around Saturn.\n\n\n\n### Pre-telescopic observation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Saturn (mythology) and Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Saturn\n\nSaturn has been known since prehistoric times,[135] and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn.[136] In ancient Greek, the planet was known as \u03a6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd ***Phainon***,[137] and in Roman times it was known as the \"star of Saturn\".[138] In ancient Roman mythology, the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god, from which the planet takes its modern name.[139] The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus; in modern Greek, the planet retains the name *Cronus*\u2014\u039a\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2: *Kronos*.[140]\n\n\nThe Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn's orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition.[141] In Hindu astrology, there are nine astrological objects, known as Navagrahas. Saturn is known as \"Shani\" and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life.[139][141] Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the \"earth star\" (\u571f\u661f). This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements.[142][143][144]\n\n\nIn ancient Hebrew, Saturn is called *Shabbathai*.[145] Its angel is Cassiel. Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is 'Ag\u020b\u0207l (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc, romanized:\u00a0*\u02bfAgyal*),[146] and its darker spirit (demon) is Z\u0203z\u0207l (Hebrew: \u05d6\u05d0\u05d6\u05dc, romanized:\u00a0*Zazl*).[146][147][148] Zazel has been described as a great angel, invoked in Solomonic magic, who is \"effective in love conjurations\".[149][150] In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, and Malay, the name of Zazel is 'Zuhal', derived from the Arabic language (Arabic: \u0632\u062d\u0644, romanized:\u00a0*Zuhal*).[147]\n\n\n\n### Telescopic pre-spaceflight observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei observed the rings of Saturn in 1610, but was unable to determine what they were\n![](image)Robert Hooke noted the shadows (a and b) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of Saturn in 1666.\nSaturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope[151] to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Christiaan Huygens saw them in 1655 and published about this in 1659. Galileo, with his primitive telescope in 1610,[152][153] incorrectly thought of Saturn's appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn's sides.[154][155] It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted, and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division.[156]\n\n\nNo further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when William Herschel discovered two further moons, Mimas and Enceladus. The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion, which has a resonance with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British team.[157]\n\n\nIn 1899 William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe, a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do.[157] Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it took more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere \u2013 a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.[158]\n\n\n\n### Spaceflight missions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Saturn\n\n#### *Pioneer 11* flyby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Pioneer 11* image of Saturn\n*Pioneer 11* made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000\u00a0km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at a high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, *Pioneer 11* measured the temperature of Titan.[159]\n\n\n\n#### *Voyager* flybys[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1980, the *Voyager 1* probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. *Voyager 1* performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable at visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out of the plane of the Solar System.[160]\n\n\nAlmost a year later, in August 1981, *Voyager 2* continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.[160]\n\n\nThe probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings, as well as the small Maxwell Gap (a gap within the C Ring) and Keeler gap (a 42\u00a0km-wide gap in the A Ring).\n\n\n\n#### *Cassini\u2013Huygens* spacecraft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cassini\u2013Huygens\n![](image)At Enceladus's south pole geysers spray water from many locations along the tiger stripes.[161]\nThe *Cassini\u2013Huygens* space probe entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. In June 2004, it conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. *Cassini*'s flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the *Huygens* probe on 25 December 2004. *Huygens* descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.[162]\n\n\nStarting in early 2005, scientists used *Cassini* to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately 1,000\u00a0times that of lightning on Earth.[163]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, NASA reported that *Cassini* had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus. These jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon's south polar region.[164] Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus.[161] In May 2011, NASA scientists reported that Enceladus \"is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it\".[165][166]\n\n![](image)Saturn eclipses the Sun, as seen from *Cassini*. The rings are visible, including the F Ring.\n*Cassini* photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E\u00a0rings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus.[167] In July 2006, images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, hydrocarbon seas were found near the North pole, the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea.[168] In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000\u00a0km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.[169]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2 November 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites.[170] In April 2013 *Cassini* sent back images of a hurricane at the planet's north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth, with winds faster than 530\u00a0km/h (330\u00a0mph).[171] On 15 September 2017, the *Cassini-Huygens* spacecraft performed the \"Grand Finale\" of its mission: a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[172][173] The atmospheric entry of *Cassini* ended the mission.\n\n\n\n#### Possible future missions[edit]\n\n\nThe continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included the Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe, and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus by *Dragonfly*.[174][175]\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amateur telescopic view of Saturn\nSaturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus, and occasionally 4 Vesta, are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. The mean apparent magnitude of Saturn is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.34.[23] Most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth. The brightest magnitude, \u22120.55, occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly, and the faintest magnitude, 1.17, occurs around the time when they are least inclined.[23] It takes approximately 29.4 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings in which clear resolution is present.[48][151] When Earth passes through the ring plane, which occurs twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin. Such a \"disappearance\" will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations.[176]\n\n\nSaturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, opposition, the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180\u00b0, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every year\u2014approximately every 378 days\u2014and results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits, which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next. Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible. For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth,[177] even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.[177]\n\n\nFrom time to time, Saturn is occulted by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in \"seasons\". Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a 12-month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered. The Moon's orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to Saturn's, so occultations will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points in the sky where the two planes intersect (both the length of Saturn's year and the 18.6-Earth year nodal precession period of the Moon's orbit influence the periodicity).[178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n2. **^** Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Walter, Elizabeth (21 April 2003). *Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary* (Second\u00a0ed.).

It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49\u00a0K (\u2212224\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371\u00a0\u00b0F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8\u00b0 with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. \n\n\nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900\u00a0km/h (560\u00a0mph),[22] variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \n\n\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Its ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbiting at much greater distance from Uranus are the known nine irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons.\n\n\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, it was visited up close only once when in 1986 the *Voyager\u00a02* probe flew by the planet.[23] Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023\u20132032 survey.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Position of Uranus (marked with a cross) on the date of its discovery, March 13th, 1781\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[24] Sir William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's *Almagest*.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.\n\n\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel \"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.\"[29][30]\n\n\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \"In the quartile near \u03b6 Tauri\u00a0... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\"[31] On 17 March he noted: \"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\"[32] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[29]\n\n\n\n\n> The power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\"[33]\n\n\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[34] Its nearly circular orbit led him to the conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\".[35] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet's than a comet's.[36]\n\n\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\"[37] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of \u00a3200 (equivalent to \u00a330,000 in 2023)[38] on condition that he moved to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[39]\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: \u039f\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), known as Caelus in Roman mythology, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which was rendered as *Uranus* in Latin (IPA: [\u02c8u\u02d0ran\u028as]).[2] It is the only one of the eight planets whose English name derives from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \"Uranian\".[40] The pronunciation of the name *Uranus* preferred among astronomers is /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/ *YOOR-\u0259-n\u0259s*,[1] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin *Uranus*, in contrast to /j\u028a\u02c8re\u026an\u0259s/ *yoo-RAY-n\u0259s*, with stress on the second syllable and a long *a*, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\n\n\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \"do the astronomical world the faver [*sic*] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\".[42] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object *Georgium Sidus* (George's Star), or the \"Georgian Planet\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[43] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[37]\n\n\n\n\n> In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande proposed that it be named *Herschel* in honour of its discoverer.[44] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names Astraea*,* Cybele (now the names of asteroids), and *Neptune*, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. The name was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even *Neptune George III* or *Neptune Great Britain*, a compromise Lexell suggested as well.[34][45] Daniel Bernoulli, suggested *Hypercronius* and *Transaturnis*. Georg Lichtenberg from G\u00f6ttingen suggested *Austr\u00e4a*, a goddess mentioned by Ovid (but who is traditionally associated with Virgo). The name *Minerva* was also proposed.[45]\n\n\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed *Uranus*, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[46] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[46] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[39][46][47][48] Bode was however apparently unaware that *Uranus* was only the Latinised form of the titular deity, and his Roman equivalent was Caelus. In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[49] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using *Georgium Sidus* to *Uranus*.[47]\n\n\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ![\u26e2](image),[g] was proposed by Johann Gottfried K\u00f6hler at Bode's request in 1782.[50] K\u00f6hler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no alchemical symbol for platinum, he suggested \u26e2 or \u26e2, a combination of the planetary-metal symbols \u2609 (gold) and \u2642 (iron), as platinum (or 'white gold') is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, \u26e2, fit better with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct.[50] This symbol predominates in modern astronomical use in the rare cases that symbols are used at all.[51][52] The second symbol, ![\u2645](image),[h] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"*un globe surmont\u00e9 par la premi\u00e8re lettre de votre nom*\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\").[44] The second symbol is nearly universal in astrology.\n\n\nUranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. Uranus's name is literally translated as the \"sky king star\" in Chinese (\u5929\u738b\u661f), Japanese (\u5929\u738b\u661f), Korean (\ucc9c\uc655\uc131), and Vietnamese (*sao Thi\u00ean V\u01b0\u01a1ng*).[53][54][55][56] In Thai, its official name is *Dao Yurenat* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e22\u0e39\u0e40\u0e23\u0e19\u0e31\u0e2a), as in English. Its other name in Thai is *Dao Maruettayu* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e24\u0e15\u0e22\u0e39, Star of M\u1e5btyu), after the Sanskrit word for 'death', *Mrtyu* (\u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941). In Mongolian, its name is *Tengeriin Van* (\u0422\u044d\u043d\u0433\u044d\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), translated as 'King of the Sky', reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is *Hele\u02bbekala*, the Hawaiian rendering of the name 'Herschel'.[57] In M\u0101ori, its name is *Wh\u0113rangi*.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nFor details of the evolution of Uranus's orbit, see Nice model.\n\nIt is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history.[60][61][62] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[60][61][63] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.[64] The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[60][61][65] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[60]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta Tauri twice since then, on 25\u00a0March\u00a01865 and 29\u00a0March\u00a01949. Uranus will return to this location again on 3\u00a0April\u00a02033. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20\u00a0AU (3\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 2\u00a0billion\u00a0mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[66] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[67]\n\n\nThe orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[68] With time, discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17\u00a0hours, 14\u00a0minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Simulated Earth view of Uranus from 1986 to 2030, from southern summer solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007 and northern summer solstice in 2028.\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0 (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. (Pluto and the protoplanet-asteroid 2 Pallas also have extreme axial tilts.) Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away, with only a narrow strip around the equator experiencing a rapid day\u2013night cycle, with the Sun low over the horizon. On the other side of Uranus's orbit, the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42\u00a0years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42\u00a0years of darkness.[71] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus, giving a period of day\u2013night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.\n\n\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the near-polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[72] Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4\u00a0billion years ago.[73]\nUranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of *Voyager\u00a02*'s flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \"south\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[74][75] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[76]\n\n\n\n\n\nList of solstices and equinoxes[77]\n| Northern hemisphere\n | Year\n | Southern hemisphere\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter solstice\n | 1902, 1986, 2069\n | Summer solstice\n |\n| Vernal equinox\n | 1923, 2007, 2092\n | Autumnal equinox\n |\n| Summer solstice\n | 1944, 2030\n | Winter solstice\n |\n| Autumnal equinox\n | 1965, 2050\n | Vernal equinox\n |\n\n\n### Visibility from Earth[edit]\n\n\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are 5.38 and 6.03.[18] This range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7\u00a0arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20\u00a0arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45\u00a0arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23\u00a0cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25\u00a0cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth and UranusUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27\u00a0g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3\u00a0and 13.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16][81] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7\u00a0Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[16]\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron\u2013nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[16][82] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55\u00a0Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus'; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4\u00a0Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5\u00a0Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[16][82] Uranus's core density is around 9\u00a0g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8\u00a0million\u00a0bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000\u00a0K.[81][82] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[16][82] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean.[83]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the interior of Uranus, listing each layer's composition\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[84][85] This phenomenon is similar to diamond rains that are theorised by scientists to exist on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.[86][87] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[88][89][90]\n\n\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[91]\n\n\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \"surface\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0km (15,881.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mi) and 24,973\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0km (15,518\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[22][92] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[22] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 1.06\u00b10.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[17][93] Uranus's heat flux is only 0.042\u00b10.047\u00a0W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075\u00a0W/m2.[93] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49\u00a0K (\u2212224.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371.5\u00a0\u00b0F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[94] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[16] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit upward heat transport;[17][93] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[16]\n\n\nIn a 2021 study, the ice giants' interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing minerals like olivine and ferropericlase, thus showing that large amounts of magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of Uranus and Neptune. If Uranus has more of this magnesium than Neptune, it could form a thermal insulation layer, thus potentially explaining the planet's low temperature.[95]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Uranus\n\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300\u00a0km below the 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa) and temperature of 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F).[96] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[97] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of \u2212300 and 50\u00a0km (\u2212186 and 31\u00a0mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa to 10\u00a0kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000\u00a0km (31 and 2,485\u00a0mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10\u221210\u00a0bar (10\u00a0kPa to 10\u00a0\u00b5Pa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000\u00a0km to as high as 50,000\u00a0km from the surface.[17] There is no mesosphere.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Uranus atmosphere's composition and layers, along with the graph of its pressure\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[17] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 0.15\u00b10.03[21] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 0.26\u00b10.05.[17][93] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275\u00b10.01,[98] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[17] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH4).[17] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[17] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3\u00a0bar (130\u00a0kPa); this represents about 20 to 30\u00a0times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[17][20][99]\n\n\nThe mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[100] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[17][101] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[102] They include ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), and diacetylene (C2HC2H).[100][103][104] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Troposphere[edit]\n\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[17] The temperature falls from about 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at \u2212300\u00a0km to 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) at 50\u00a0km.[96][99] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57\u00a0K (\u2212224 and \u2212216\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371 and \u2212357\u00a0\u00b0F) depending on planetary latitude.[17][92] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0K (\u2212214.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212353.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[92][93]\n\n\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100\u00a0bar (5 to 10\u00a0MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40\u00a0bar (2 to 4\u00a0MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10\u00a0bar (0.3 and 1\u00a0MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2\u00a0bar (0.1 to 0.2\u00a0MPa).[17][20][96][106] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[22]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus's upper atmosphere taken during the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program.[107]\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850\u00a0K (527 and 577\u00a0\u00b0C; 980 and 1,070\u00a0\u00b0F) at the base of the thermosphere.[97] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[108] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[102] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[108] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300\u00a0km corresponding to a pressure range of 1000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between 75 and 170\u00a0K (\u2212198 and \u2212103\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212325 and \u2212154\u00a0\u00b0F).[100][103]\n\n\nThe most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10\u22127 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[100][103][105] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[103] The abundance ratio of water is around 7\u00d710\u22129.[104] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of the stratosphere and tropopause (below 10\u00a0mBar level) forming haze layers,[102] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[100][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Planet Uranus - North Pole - Cyclone (VLA; October 2021)\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800\u00a0K (527\u00a0\u00b0C) to 850\u00a0K (577\u00a0\u00b0C).[17][109] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1\u00a0mBar pressure levels may contribute too.[97][109] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000\u00a0km (31,000\u00a0mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[97][109]\n\n\nThis extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[109] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[97] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[99] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000\u00a0km (1,200 to 6,200\u00a0mi).[99] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[109][110] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[111] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Uranus\n\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[22] When *Voyager\u00a02* flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of 10 cloud features across the entire planet.[113][114] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat is markedly lower than that of the other giant planets, as stated previously Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\n\n### Banded structure, winds and clouds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 2*'s timelapse of Uranus's dynamic atmosphere\nIn 1986, *Voyager\u00a02* found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[113] Their boundary is located at about \u221245\u00b0 of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from \u221245 to \u221250\u00b0 is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[113][115] It is called a southern \"collar\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2\u00a0bar (see above).[116] Besides the large-scale banded structure, *Voyager\u00a02* observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[113] In all other respects, Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.\n\n\n*Voyager\u00a02* arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[115] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[115] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45\u00b0 of latitude.[117] In 2023, a team employing the Very Large Array observed a dark collar at 80\u00b0 latitude, and a bright spot at the north pole, indicating the presence of a polar vortex.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first dark spot observed on Uranus. Image obtained by the HST ACS in 2006.\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably, partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[22] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[22] An early explanation\u2014that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them \u2013 was shown to be incorrect.[119][120] Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[120] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[120] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby.[22][114] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[22] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[121] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[122]\n\n\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[22] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from \u2212360 to \u2212180\u00a0km/h (\u2212220 to \u2212110\u00a0mph).[22][115] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near \u00b120\u00b0 latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[22][92] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at \u00b160\u00b0 latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[22] Wind speeds at \u221240\u00b0 latitude range from 540 to 720\u00a0km/h (340 to 450\u00a0mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[22] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860\u00a0km/h (540\u00a0mph) are observed near +50\u00b0 latitude.[22][115][123]\n\n\n\n### Seasonal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus in 2005. Rings, southern collar and a bright cloud in the northern hemisphere are visible (HST ACS image).\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[120][124] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820\u00a0km/h (510\u00a0mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \"Fourth of July fireworks\".[114] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric activity.[121] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[125][122] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere has existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[126] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[127] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[108] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry.[119]\n\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[122] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[126] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[122] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes in brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[122]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[116] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[114] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[120] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[117]\n\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[122] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[116] The bright collar at \u221245\u00b0 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[116] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[116] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[128] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[114][128]\n\n\n\n## Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The magnetic field of Uranus  \n(animated; 25 March 2020)\nBefore the arrival of *Voyager\u00a02*, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[129]\n\n\n*Voyager*'s observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59\u00b0 from the axis of rotation.[129][130] In fact, the magnetic dipole is shifted from Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one-third of the planetary radius.[129] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1\u00a0gauss (10\u00a0\u00b5T), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1\u00a0gauss (110\u00a0\u00b5T).[129] The average field at the surface is 0.23\u00a0gauss (23\u00a0\u00b5T).[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)A diagram showing Uranus's asymmetric magnetosphere\nStudies of *Voyager\u00a02* data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[131] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \"magnetic equator\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[130] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50\u00a0times that of Earth.[129][130] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[130] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water\u2013ammonia ocean.[83][132] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[89]\n\n\n\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[129][130][133] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[129][130] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[129][134]\n\n![](image)Aurorae on Uranus taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) installed on Hubble.[135]Uranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[130][133] Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[133] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2\u00a0megaelectronvolts, respectively.[133] The density of low-energy (below 1\u00a0kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2\u00a0cm\u22123.[136] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[133] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000\u00a0years.[133] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[137]\n\n\nUranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[109] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[112] In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the *Voyager\u00a02* space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Uranus\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n![](image)Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos. From left to right, they are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. (collage of *Voyager\u00a02* photographs)\n![](image)Uranus and six moons taken by the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam.\nUranus has 27 known natural satellites.[65] The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.[82][140] The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[82] The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[12] The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only 788.9\u00a0km (490.2\u00a0mi), or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[113] They are ice\u2013rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[137][141]\n\n\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest.[113][137] Miranda has fault canyons 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[113] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[142] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[143][144] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[145]\n\n\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun\u2013Uranus L3 Lagrangian point\u2014a gravitationally unstable region at 180\u00b0 in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[146][147] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit.\n2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[147]\n\n\n\n## Rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus's rings and atmosphere as imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared camera.The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[113] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the \u03b5 ring. All except the two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow \u2013 they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[137][148]\n\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[149][150] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[151] Later they detected four additional rings.[151] The rings were directly imaged when *Voyager\u00a02* passed Uranus in 1986.[113] *Voyager\u00a02* also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[152] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[153][154] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[153][155] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[153]\n\n\nAlthough the Uranian rings are very difficult to directly observe from Earth, advances in digital imaging have allowed several amateur astronomers to successfully photograph the rings with red or infrared filters; telescopes with apertures as small as 36 cm (14 inches) may be able to detect the rings with proper imaging equipment.[156]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus as seen from the *Cassini* spacecraft at Saturn\nLaunched in 1977, *Voyager\u00a02* made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500\u00a0km (50,600\u00a0mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[99] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. Voyager 2 examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[113][137][157] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[129]\n\n\nNo other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then, though there have been many proposed missions to revisit the Uranus system. The possibility of sending the *Cassini* spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere,[158] as it would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[158] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1\u20135 atmospheres.[159] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013\u20132022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisaged launch during 2020\u20132023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[159] The committee's opinion was reaffirmed in 2022, when a Uranus probe/orbiter mission was placed at the highest priority, due to the lack of knowledge about ice giants.[160]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n* In astrology, the planet Uranus (symbol ![Uranus's astrological symbol](image)) is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Because Uranus is cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the colour electric blue, which is close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius[161] (see Uranus in astrology).\n* The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, was named after the then-newly discovered Uranus.[162]\n* Lydia Sigourney included her poem ![](image) The Georgian Planet in her 1827 collection of poetry.\n* \"Uranus, the Magician\" is a movement in Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, written between 1914 and 1916.\n* Operation Uranus was the successful military operation in World War II by the Red Army to take back Stalingrad and marked the turning point in the land war against the Wehrmacht.\n* The lines \"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/When a new planet swims into his ken\", from John Keats's \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", are a reference to Herschel's discovery of Uranus.[163]\n* In English language popular culture, humor is often derived from the common pronunciation of Uranus' name, which resembles that of the phrase \"your anus\".[164]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 QF99 and 2014 YX49, the only two known Uranus trojans\n* Colonisation of Uranus\n* Extraterrestrial diamonds (thought to be abundant in Uranus)\n* Outline of Uranus\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n* Uranus in astrology\n* Uranus in fiction\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  These are the mean elements from VSOP87, together with derived quantities.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g***  Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n3. **^**  Calculated using data from Seidelmann, 2007.[11]\n4. **^**  Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n5. **^**  Calculation of He, H2 and CH4 molar fractions is based on a 2.3% mixing ratio of methane to hydrogen and the 15/85 He/H2 proportions measured at the tropopause.\n6. **^**  Because, in the English-speaking world, the latter sounds like \"your anus\", the former pronunciation also saves embarrassment: as Pamela Gay, an astronomer at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, noted on her podcast, to avoid \"being made fun of by any small schoolchildren\u00a0... when in doubt, don't emphasise anything and just say /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/.

In my view, it is necessary to follow the mythology in this election, which had been borrowed from the ancient name of the other planets; because in the series of previously known, perceived by a strange person or event of modern times name of a planet would very noticeable. Diodorus of Cilicia tells the story of Atlas, an ancient people that inhabited one of the most fertile areas in Africa, and looked at the sea shores of his country as the homeland of the gods. Uranus was her first king, founder of their civilized life and inventor of many useful arts. At the same time he is also described as a diligent and skilful astronomers of antiquity ... even more: Uranus was the father of Saturn and the Atlas, as the former is the father of Jupiter.\n> \n>\n47. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nLittmann, Mark (2004). *Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System*.

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17\u00a0times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8\u00a0years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5\u00a0billion kilometres; 2.8\u00a0billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ![\u2646](image), representing Neptune's trident.[d]\n\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23\u00a0September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th\u00a0century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by *Voyager\u00a02*, when it flew by the planet on 25\u00a0August 1989; *Voyager\u00a02* remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[18][19] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.\n\n\nLike the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of *ices* such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[20] both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them.[21] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[22] The blue colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to the thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.[23][24][25]\n\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100\u00a0km/h (580\u00a0m/s; 1,300\u00a0mph).[27] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55\u00a0K (\u2212218\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212361\u00a0\u00b0F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400\u00a0K (5,100\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,300\u00a0\u00b0F).[28][29] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by *Voyager 2*.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei\nSome of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo Galilei's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match with what is now known to have been the positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close\u2014in conjunction\u2014to Jupiter in the night sky.[31] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[32] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least aware that the \"star\" he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars.[33]\n\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[34] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[35] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February\u00a01844. Adams continued to work in 1845\u20131846 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Urbain Le Verrier\nIn 1845\u20131846, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June\u00a01846, upon seeing Le\u00a0Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.[35][38] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, Johann Gottfried Galle, and on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[39][35][40]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Le\u00a0Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le\u00a0Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23\u00a0September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1\u00b0 from the \"*five degrees east of Delta Capricorn*\" position Le\u00a0Verrier had predicted it to be,[41][42] about 12\u00b0 from Adams's prediction, and on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.\n\n\nIn the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le\u00a0Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nShortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le\u00a0Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name *Janus*. In England, Challis put forward the name *Oceanus*.[45]\n\n\nClaiming the right to name his discovery, Le\u00a0Verrier quickly proposed the name *Neptune* for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.[46] In October, he sought to name the planet *Le\u00a0Verrier*, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, Fran\u00e7ois Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France.[47] French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name *Herschel* for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir\u00a0William Herschel, and *Leverrier* for the new planet.[48]\n\n\nStruve came out in favour of the name *Neptune* on 29\u00a0December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences,[49] after the colour of the planet as viewed through a telescope.[50] Soon, *Neptune* became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.[e][51]\n\n\nMost languages today use some variant of the name \"Neptune\" for the planet; indeed, in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"sea king star\" (\u6d77\u738b\u661f).[52][53] In Mongolian, Neptune is called *Dalain van* (\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called *Poseidon* (\u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, *Poseidonas*), the Greek counterpart of Neptune.[54] In Hebrew, *Rahab* (\u05e8\u05d4\u05d1), from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms, was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing Latin term *Neptun* (\u05e0\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05df) is commonly used.[55][56] In M\u0101ori, the planet is called *Tangaroa*, named after the M\u0101ori god of the sea.[57] In Nahuatl, the planet is called *Tl\u0101locc\u012btlalli*, named after the rain god Tl\u0101loc.[57] In Thai, Neptune is referred to by its Westernised name *Dao Nepchun/Nepjun* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e08\u0e39\u0e19), but is also called *Dao Ket* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e01\u0e15\u0e38, lit.\u2009'star of Ketu'), after Ketu (\u0915\u0947\u0924\u0941), the descending lunar node, who plays a role in Hindu astrology. In Malay, the name *Waruna*, after the Hindu god of seas, is attested as far back as the 1970s,[58] but was eventually superseded by the Latinate equivalents *Neptun* (in Malaysian[59]) or *Neptunus* (in Indonesian[60]).\n\n\nThe usual adjectival form is *Neptunian*. The nonce form *Poseidean* (/p\u0259\u02c8sa\u026adi\u0259n/), from Poseidon, has also been used,[4] though the usual adjectival form of Poseidon is *Poseidonian* (/\u02ccp\u0252sa\u026a\u02c8do\u028ani\u0259n/).[61]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nFrom its discovery in 1846 until the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer than Neptune to the Sun, making Neptune the ninth planet from the Sun during this period.[62][63] The increasingly accurate estimations of Pluto's mass from ten times that of Earth's to far less than that of the Moon[64] and the discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[65][66] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[67]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A size comparison of Neptune and Earth\nNeptune's mass of 1.0243\u00d71026\u00a0kg[7] is intermediate between Earth and the larger gas giants: it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter.[f] Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15\u00a0m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth,[68] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[69] Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764\u00a0km[10] is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\nNeptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core. Pressure in the atmosphere reaches about 10\u00a0GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physical and chemical composition of Neptune's interior\nThe mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane.[1] As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid (supercritical fluid). This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean.[72] The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.[73] At a depth of 7,000\u00a0km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones.[74][75][76] Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[77][75] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.[78][79][80]\n\n\nThe core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth.[81] The pressure at the centre is 7\u00a0Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400\u00a0K.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combined colour and near-infrared image of Neptune, showing bands of methane in its atmosphere, and four of its moons, Proteus, Larissa, Galatea, and Despina\nA time-lapse video of Neptune and its moons\nAt high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.[28] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600\u00a0nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neptune - cloud cover over three decades (1994-2023)[84]\nNeptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10\u00a0kPa).[21] The stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10\u22125 to 10\u22124 bars (1 to 10\u00a0Pa).[21] The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck.\nModels suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude.[84] The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0\u00a0MPa), where the temperature reaches 273\u00a0K (0\u00a0\u00b0C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.[85]\n\n\nHigh-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitudes. These circumferential bands have widths of 50\u2013150\u00a0km and lie about 50\u2013110\u00a0km above the cloud deck.[86] These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. In August 2023, the clouds of Neptune vanished, possibly due to \"solar flare\".[84] Thirty years of observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes showed that Neptune's cloud activity is bound to Solar cycles, and not to the planet's seasons.[87][88]\n\n\nNeptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne.[21][28] The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.[21][89] The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.[21]\n\n\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750\u00a0K.[90][91] The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.[85][89]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nNeptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47\u00b0 and offset at least 0.55\u00a0radius, or about 13,500\u00a0km from the planet's physical centre. Before *Voyager 2*'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[85] resulting in a dynamo action.[92]\n\n\nThe dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14\u00a0microteslas (0.14\u00a0G).[93] The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017\u00a0T\u00b7m3 (14\u00a0\u03bcT\u00b7*R**N*3, where *R**N* is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of an offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.[94][95]\n\n\nMeasurements by *Voyager 2* in extreme-ultraviolet and radio frequencies revealed that Neptune has faint and weak but complex and unique aurorae; however, these observations were limited in time and did not contain infrared. Subsequent astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have not glimpsed the aurorae, in contrast to the more well-defined aurorae of Uranus.[96][97]\n\n\nNeptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23\u201326.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.[94]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud),[98] and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated.\nNeptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600\u00a0m/s (2,200\u00a0km/h; 1,300\u00a0mph)\u2014exceeding supersonic flow.[27] More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20\u00a0m/s in the easterly direction to 325\u00a0m/s westward.[99] At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400\u00a0m/s along the equator to 250\u00a0m/s at the poles.[85] Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.[100] The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a \"skin effect\" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.[21] At 70\u00b0 S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300\u00a0m/s.[21]\n\n\nNeptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. *Voyager 2* observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby,[101] but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.\n\n\nThe abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10\u2013100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.[21]\n\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73\u00a0K (\u2212200\u00a0\u00b0C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole.[102] The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.[103]\n\n\nBecause of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.[104]\n\n\n\n### Storms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a06,600\u00a0km (8,100\u00a0mi \u00d7\u00a04,100\u00a0mi)[101] was discovered by NASA's *Voyager 2* spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.[105]\n\n\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the *Voyager 2* encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by *Voyager 2*).[100] The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as *Voyager 2* approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.[106] In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] In 2023, the first ground-based observation of a dark spot on Neptune was announced.[107]\n\n\nNeptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features,[108] so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.[86] Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer.[109] The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other, unknown mechanism.[110]\n\n\n\n* ![The appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]](image)\n\nThe appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]\n* ![The Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]](image)\n\nThe Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]\n* ![The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2](image)\n\nThe Great Dark Spot in a color-uncalibrated image by *Voyager 2.*\n* ![Neptune's shrinking vortex[113]](image)\n\nNeptune's shrinking vortex[113]\n\n\n### Internal heating[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Four images taken a few hours apart with the NASA/ESA *Hubble Space Telescope*'s Wide Field Camera 3. Near infrared radiation data has been used as red channel.[114]\nNeptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8\u00a0K (\u2212221.3\u00a0\u00b0C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa), the temperature is 72.00\u00a0K (\u2212201.15\u00a0\u00b0C).[115] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun;[116] whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.[117] Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% of its amount of sunlight,[21] yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.[118]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neptune (red arc) completes one orbit around the Sun (centre) for every 164.79 orbits of Earth. The light blue object represents Uranus.\nThe average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.5 billion km (about 30.1\u00a0astronomical units (AU)), and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79\u00a0years, subject to a variability of around \u00b10.1\u00a0years. The perihelion distance is 29.81\u00a0AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33\u00a0AU.[g]\n\n\nOn 11\u00a0July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846,[120] although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26\u00a0day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.[11][121][122]\n\n\nThe elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77\u00b0 compared to that of Earth.\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32\u00b0,[123] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23\u00b0) and Mars (25\u00b0). As a result, Neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[104] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11\u00a0hours.[11] Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.\n\n\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18\u00a0hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12\u00a0hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,[124] and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.[86]\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital resonances[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kuiper belt, resonant trans-Neptunian object, and Neptune trojan\n\n![](image)A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant \"classical belt\" (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos).\nNeptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30\u00a0AU out to about 55\u00a0AU from the Sun.[125] Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in its structure. The region between 40 and 42\u00a0AU is an example.[126]\n\n\nThere do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects,[127] is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them.[128] Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.[129] The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.[130]\n\n\nNeptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the Sun\u2013Neptune L4 and L5 Lagrangian points\u2014gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in its orbit, respectively.[131] Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured. The first object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing L5 Lagrangian point was 2008 LC18.[132] Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite, (309239) 2007 RW10.[133] The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years.[133]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Nice model\n\n![](image)A simulation showing the outer planets and Kuiper belt: a) before Jupiter and Saturn reached a 2:1 resonance; b) after inward scattering of Kuiper belt objects following the orbital shift of Neptune; c) after ejection of scattered Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter\nThe formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.[70]\n\n\nAn alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.[134] This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.[135] The current most widely accepted[136][137][138] explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.\n\n\n\n## Moons and rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Neptune\n\nFor a timeline of discovery dates, see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons.\n\n![Shown in this image are Neptune and its moons: Triton, Galatea, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Proteus, and Larissa](image)An annotated picture of Neptune's many moons as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. The bright blue diffraction star is Triton, Neptune's largest moon.\nNeptune has 14 known moons.[7][139] Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[h] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17\u00a0days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.[140] It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6\u00a0billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.[141] In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System,[142] with estimated temperatures of 38\u00a0K (\u2212235\u00a0\u00b0C).[143]\n\n\nNeptune's second-known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.[i]\n\n\nFrom July to September 1989, *Voyager 2* discovered six moons of Neptune.[144] Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity.[145] Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons\u2014Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea\u2014orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when *Voyager 2* observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.[146][147] A new moon and the smallest yet, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images.[148] Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Neptune\n\n![](image)Neptune's rings and moons viewed in infrared by the James Webb Space Telescope\nNeptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn.[149] The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.[150] The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000\u00a0km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000\u00a0km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000\u00a0km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000\u00a0km.[151]\n\n\nThe first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan.[30][152] In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.[153]\nEvidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion.[154] Images from *Voyager 2* in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.\n\n\nThe outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named *Courage*, *Libert\u00e9*, *Egalit\u00e9\u00a01*, *Egalit\u00e9\u00a02* and *Fraternit\u00e9* (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).[155] The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.[156][157]\n\n\nEarth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings were much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by *Voyager 2*. In particular, it seems that the *Libert\u00e9* arc might disappear in as little as one century.[158]\n\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Movement of Neptune in front of the stars of Aquarius in 2022\n![Neptune visible in the night sky](image)In 2018, the European Southern Observatory used adaptive optics to get clear and high-resolution images of Neptune from the surface of Earth.\nNeptune brightened about 10% between 1980 and 2000 mostly due to the changing of the seasons.[159] Neptune may continue to brighten as it approaches perihelion in 2042. The apparent magnitude currently ranges from 7.67 to 7.89 with a mean of 7.78 and a standard deviation of 0.06.[15] Prior to 1980, the planet was as faint as magnitude 8.0.[15] Neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. It can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe.[160] A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.[161]\n\n\nBecause of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4\u00a0arcseconds,[7][17] the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).[162][163][164] The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[165] Neptune is currently approaching perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both *Hubble* and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.[166]\n\n\nFrom Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367\u00a0days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[122]\n\n\nNeptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[41]\n\n\nObservation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field.[85] In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.[167]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Neptune\n\n![](image)A *Voyager 2* mosaic of Triton\n*Voyager 2* is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft's closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for *Voyager 1*'s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from *Voyager 2* became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, *Neptune All Night*.[168]\n\n\nDuring the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246\u00a0minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, *Voyager 2*'s mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400\u00a0km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.[169]\n\n\nThe spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and *Voyager 2* also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.[144][169]\n\n\nThe flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which was found to be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered Planet X acted upon the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.[170][171]\n\n\nSince 2018, the China National Space Administration has been studying a concept for a pair of *Voyager*-like interstellar probes tentatively known as *Interstellar Express* or *Interstellar Heliosphere Probe*.[172] Both probes will be launched at the same time in 2024 and take differing paths to explore opposing ends of the heliosphere; the second probe, *IHP-2*, will fly by Neptune in January 2038, passing only 1,000\u00a0km above the cloud tops, and potentially carry an atmospheric impactor to be released during its approach.[173] Afterward, it will continue on its mission throughout the Kuiper belt toward the tail of the heliosphere, so far unexplored.\n\n\nAfter *Voyager 2* and *IHP-2*'s flybys, the next step in scientific exploration of the Neptunian system is considered to be an orbital mission; most proposals have been by NASA, most often for a Flagship orbiter.[174] Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s.[174] However, there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's \"Vision Missions Studies\" for a \"Neptune Orbiter with Probes\" mission that does *Cassini*-level science.[175] A subsequent proposal was for *Argo*, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019, that would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object. The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around 2029.[176] The proposed *New Horizons 2* mission (which was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system. Currently a pending proposal for the Discovery program, *Trident* would conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton;[177] however, the mission was not selected for Discovery 15 or 16. *Neptune Odyssey* is the current mission concept for a Neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe being studied as a possible large strategic science mission by NASA that would launch between 2031 and 2033, and arrive at Neptune by 2049.[178]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Neptune\n* Hot Neptune\n* Neptune in astrology\n* Neptunium\n* *Neptune, the Mystic* \u2013 one of the seven movements in Gustav Holst's *Planets* suite\n* Timeline of the far future\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Orbital elements refer to the Neptune barycentre and Solar System barycentre.

Following the right-hand rule for prograde rotation puts Ishtar Terra in the negative hemisphere and makes the axial tilt 177.36\u00b0.\n |\n\n\n**Venus** is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a \"morning star\" or an \"evening star\". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,[20][21] appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.\n\n\nVenus has a weak induced magnetosphere and an especially thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, which creates, together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover, an extreme greenhouse effect. This results at the surface in a mean temperature of 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid, while at cloudy altitudes of 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) above the surface, the pressure, temperature and also radiation are very much like at Earth's surface. Conditions possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, with recent research having found indicative, but not convincing, evidence of life on the planet. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history, possibly enough to form oceans, but runaway greenhouse effects eventually evaporated any water, which then was taken into space by the solar wind.[22][23][24] Internally, Venus is thought to consist of a core,\u00a0mantle, and\u00a0crust, the latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shaping the surface with large resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System which have no moons.[25] Nonetheless, studies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics during ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\nVenus has a rotation which has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the strong currents and drag of its atmosphere. This rotation produces, together with the time of 224.7 Earth days it takes Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun (a Venusian solar year), a Venusian solar day length of 117 Earth days, resulting in a Venusian year being just under two Venusian days long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. While this allows them to come closer to each other at inferior conjunction than any other pair of Solar System planets, Mercury stays on average closer to them and any other planet, as Mercury is the most central planet and passes by most frequently.[28] That said, Venus and Earth between them have the lowest difference in gravitational potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This has allowed Venus to be the most accessible destination and attractive gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights.\n\n\nIn 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight in human history, followed by many essential interplanetary firsts like the first soft landing on another planet in 1970. These probes made it evident that extreme greenhouse effects have created oppressive surface conditions, an insight that has crucially informed predictions about global warming on Earth.[29][30] This finding stopped most attention towards theories and the then popular science fiction about Venus being a habitable or inhabited planet. Crewed flights to Venus have been suggested nevertheless, either to flyby Venus, performing a gravity assist for reaching Mars faster and safer, or to enter the Venusian atmosphere and stay aloft at altitudes with conditions more comparable to Earth's surface, except atmospheric composition, than anywhere else in the Solar System. Contemporarily, Venus has again gained interest as a case for research into particularly the development of Earth-like planets and their habitability.\n\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Venus to scale among the terrestrial planets of the Solar System, which are arranged by the order of their Inner Solar System orbits outward from the Sun (from left: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars)\nVenus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\".[31] Venus is close to spherical due to its slow rotation.[32] Venus has a diameter of 12,103.6\u00a0km (7,520.8\u00a0mi)\u2014only 638.4\u00a0km (396.7\u00a0mi) less than Earth's\u2014and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[33] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Venus\n\n![The atmosphere of Venus appears darker and lined with shadows. The shadows trace the prevailing wind direction.](image)Cloud structure of the Venusian atmosphere, made visible through ultraviolet imaging\nVenus has a dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen\u2014both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface with a 6.5% density of water\u2014[34] and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide.[35] The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's\u2014a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1\u00a0km (5\u20448\u00a0mi) under Earth's oceans. The density at the surface is 65\u00a0kg/m3 (4.1\u00a0lb/cu\u00a0ft), 6.5% that of water[34] or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293\u00a0K (20\u00a0\u00b0C; 68\u00a0\u00b0F) at sea level. The CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 735\u00a0K (462\u00a0\u00b0C; 864\u00a0\u00b0F).[36][37] This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) and maximum surface temperature of 700\u00a0K (427\u00a0\u00b0C; 801\u00a0\u00b0F),[38][39] even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance. Because of its runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has been identified by scientists such as Carl Sagan as a warning and research object linked to climate change on Earth.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\nVenus Temperature[40]\n| Type | SurfaceTemperature\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Maximum | 900\u00a0\u00b0F (482\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n| Normal | 847\u00a0\u00b0F (453\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n| Minimum | 820\u00a0\u00b0F (438\u00a0\u00b0C)\n |\n\n\nVenus's atmosphere is rich in primordial noble gases compared to that of Earth.[41] This enrichment indicates an early divergence from Earth in evolution. An unusually large comet impact[42] or accretion of a more massive primary atmosphere from solar nebula[43] have been proposed to explain the enrichment. However, the atmosphere is depleted of radiogenic argon, a proxy for mantle degassing, suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism.[44][45]\n\n\nStudies have suggested that billions of years ago, Venus's atmosphere could have been much more like the one surrounding the early Earth, and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface.[46][47][48] After a period of 600 million to several billion years,[49] solar forcing from rising luminosity of the Sun and possibly large volcanic resurfacing caused the evaporation of the original water and the current atmosphere.[50] A runaway greenhouse effect was created once a critical level of greenhouse gases (including water) was added to its atmosphere.[51] Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earth-like life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of Venus, 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) up from the surface, where the atmospheric conditions are the most Earth-like in the Solar System,[52] with temperatures ranging between 303 and 353\u00a0K (30 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C; 86 and 176\u00a0\u00b0F), and the pressure and radiation being about the same as at Earth's surface, but with acidic clouds and the carbon dioxide air.[53][54][55] The putative detection of an absorption line of phosphine in Venus's atmosphere, with no known pathway for abiotic production, led to speculation in September 2020 that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere.[56][57] Later research attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide,[58] or found that in fact there was no absorption line.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Types of cloud layers, as well as temperature and pressure change by altitude in the atmosphere\nThermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the planet's two hemispheres, those facing and not facing the Sun, despite Venus's slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even without the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen.[61]\n\n\nAbove the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds, consisting mainly of sulfuric acid, which is formed by sulfur dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate. Additionally, the clouds consist of approximately 1% ferric chloride.[62][63] Other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions.[62] These clouds reflect, similar to thick cloud cover on Earth,[64] about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space,[65] and since they cover the whole planet they prevent visual observation of Venus's surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground, with only 10% of the received sunlight reaching the surface,[66] resulting in average daytime levels of illumination at the surface of 14,000 lux, comparable to that on Earth \"in the daytime with overcast clouds\".[67] Strong 300\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.[68] Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10\u201320% rotation speed.[69]\n\n\nThe surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[4][70] Venus's minute axial tilt\u2014less than 3\u00b0, compared to 23\u00b0 on Earth\u2014also minimises seasonal temperature variation.[71] Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian temperatures. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about 655\u00a0K (380\u00a0\u00b0C; 715\u00a0\u00b0F) and an atmospheric pressure of about 4.5\u00a0MPa (45\u00a0bar).[72][73] In 1995, the *Magellan* spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks, a \"Venus snow\" that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena).[74]\n\n\nAlthough Venus has no seasons, in 2019, astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere, possibly caused by opaque, absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds. The variation causes observed changes in the speed of Venus's zonal winds and appears to rise and fall in time with the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.[75]\n\n\nThe existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial[76] since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes.[77][78][79] In 2006\u201307, *Venus Express* clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least half that on Earth,[80] however other instruments have not detected lightning at all.[76] The origin of any lightning remains unclear, but could originate from clouds or Venusian volcanoes.\n\n\nIn 2007, *Venus Express* discovered that a huge double atmospheric polar vortex exists at the south pole.[81][82] *Venus Express* discovered, in 2011, that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of Venus.[83] On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to \"the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\"[84][85]\n\n\nIn December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's *Akatsuki* mission observed bow shaped objects in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system.[86][87][88]\n\n\n\n### Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geology of Venus, Geodynamics of Venus, Mapping of Venus, and Surface features of Venus\n\n![](image)Color-coded elevation map, showing the elevated terrae \"continents\" in yellow and minor features of Venus.\nThe Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. *Venera* landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks.[89] The surface was mapped in detail by *Magellan* in 1990\u201391. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been recent eruptions.[90][91]\n\n\nAbout 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains.[92] Two highland \"continents\" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) above the Venusian average surface elevation.[93] The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek mythological goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.[94]\n\n\nThe absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma. The planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, at 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][96] Venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called \"farra\", which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50\u00a0km (12 to 31\u00a0mi) across, and from 100 to 1,000\u00a0m (330 to 3,280\u00a0ft) high; radial, star-like fracture systems called \"novae\"; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as \"arachnoids\"; and \"coronae\", circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.[97]\n\n\nMost Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women.[98] Exceptions are Maxwell Montes, named after James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Ovda Regio. The last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International Astronomical Union, the body which oversees planetary nomenclature.[99]\n\n\nThe longitude of physical features on Venus is expressed relative to its prime meridian. The original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature Eve, located south of Alpha Regio.[100] After the Venera missions were completed, the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater Ariadne on Sedna Planitia.[101][102]\n\n\nThe stratigraphically oldest tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding basaltic plains measured by *Venus Express* and *Magellan*, indicating a different, possibly a more felsic, mineral assemblage.[23][103] The mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the presence of water ocean and plate tectonics, implying that habitable condition had existed on early Venus with large bodies of water at some point.[104] However, the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain.[105]\n\n\nStudies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest that Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics durng ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)180-degree panorama of Venus's surface from the Soviet *Venera 9* lander, 1975. Black-and-white image of barren, black, slate-like rocks against a flat sky. The ground and the probe are the focus.\n#### Volcanism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanism on Venus\n\n![](image)Radar mosaic of two 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) wide (and less than 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) high) pancake domes in Venus's Eistla region\nMuch of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.[97]:\u200a154 More than 85,000 volcanoes on Venus were identified and mapped.[106][107] This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject to the same erosion process. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years,[108] whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][97]\n\n\nSeveral lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. Sulfur dioxide concentrations in the upper atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold.[109] This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.[110][111] It has been suggested that Venusian lightning (discussed below) could originate from volcanic activity (i.e. volcanic lightning). In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence that suggests that Venus is currently volcanically active, specifically the detection of olivine, a volcanic product that would weather quickly on the planet's surface.[112][113]\n\n\nThis massive volcanic activity is fueled by a superheated interior, which models say could be explained by energetic collisions from when the planet was young. Impacts would have had significantly higher velocity than on Earth, both because Venus' orbit is faster due to its closer proximity to the Sun and because objects would require higher orbital eccentricities to collide with the planet.[114]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by *Venus Express*, in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone Ganis Chasma,[115][note 1] near the shield volcano Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions.[116][117] The actual temperatures are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured, but are likely to have been in the 800\u20131,100\u00a0K (527\u2013827\u00a0\u00b0C; 980\u20131,520\u00a0\u00b0F) range, relative to a normal temperature of 740\u00a0K (467\u00a0\u00b0C; 872\u00a0\u00b0F).[118] In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the *Magellan* orbiter. Using computer simulations, they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Craters[edit]\n\n\n![The plains of Venus](image)Impact craters on the surface of Venus (false-colour image reconstructed from radar data)\nAlmost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event 300\u2013600\u00a0million years ago,[95][96] followed by a decay in volcanism.[120] Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100\u00a0million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.[97]\n\n\nVenusian craters range from 3 to 280\u00a0km (2 to 174\u00a0mi) in diameter. No craters are smaller than 3\u00a0km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.[121] Incoming projectiles less than 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.[122]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![Spherical cross-section of Venus showing the different layers](image)The differentiated structure of Venus\nWithout data from reflection seismology or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus.[123] The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate,[124] although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[125] The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[126] The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900\u20133,450\u00a0km.[125] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500\u00a0km.[127]\n\n\nThe principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.[128] Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.[95]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field and core[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, *Venera 4* found Venus's magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind,[129][130][*page\u00a0needed*] rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against solar and cosmic radiation, reaching at elevations of 54 to 48 km Earth-like levels.[131][132]\n\n\nThe lack of an intrinsic magnetic field on Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size and was expected to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo.[133][134] This implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is reheating the crust.[135]\n\n\nOne possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,[136] or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its core has already been completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.[135]\n\n\nAnother possibility is that the absence of a late, large impact on Venus (*contra* the Earth's \"Moon-forming\" impact) left the core of Venus stratified from the core's incremental formation, and without the forces to initiate/sustain convection, and thus a \"geodynamo\".[137]\n\n\nThe weak magnetosphere around Venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of water molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed.[138] However, the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first 2\u20133 billion years, so the water loss may have occurred more recently.[139] The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.[140]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit of Venus\n\n![Mars circling the Sun further and slower than Earth](image)Venus is the second planet from the Sun, making a full orbit in about 224 days\nVenus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72\u00a0AU (108\u00a0million\u00a0km; 67\u00a0million\u00a0mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.[4] Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting early climate evolution.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Venus and its rotation in respect to its revolution.\nAll planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets rotate on their axes in an anticlockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days\u2014the slowest rotation of any planet. This Venusian sidereal day lasts therefore longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Slowed by its strong atmospheric current the length of the day also fluctuates by up to 20 minutes.[142] Venus's equator rotates at 6.52\u00a0km/h (4.05\u00a0mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4\u00a0km/h (1,040.4\u00a0mph).[note 2][146] Venus's rotation period measured with *Magellan* spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and *Venus Express* visits, with a difference of about 6.5\u00a0minutes.[147] Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days \u2014 the 116-day figure is close to the average number of days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its orbit).[11] One Venusian year is about 1.92\u00a0Venusian solar days.[148] To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east,[148] although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.[149]\n\n\nVenus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.[150][151] The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5\u00a0Venusian solar days (5.001444 to be precise),[152] but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.[153]\n\n\nVenus has no natural satellites.[154] It has several trojan asteroids: the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68[155][156] and two other temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133.[157] In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following 200\u00a0years, but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.[158] About 10\u00a0million\u00a0years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and the resulting Tidal deceleration caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.[159] If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.[154]\n\n\nThe orbital space of Venus has a dust ring-cloud,[160] with a suspected origin either from Venus\u2013trailing asteroids,[161] interplanetary dust migrating in waves, or the remains of the Solar System's original circumstellar disc that formed the planetary system.[162]\n\n\n\n### Orbit in respect to Earth[edit]\n\n\n![A complex, spiral, floral pattern with five loops encircling the middle](image)Earth is positioned at the centre of the diagram, and the curve represents the direction and distance of Venus as a function of time.\nEarth and Venus have a near orbital resonance of 13:8 (Earth orbits eight times for every 13 orbits of Venus).[163]\nTherefore they approach each other and reach inferior conjunction in synodic periods of 584 days, on average.[4] The path that Venus makes in relation to Earth viewed geocentrically draws a pentagram over five synodic periods, shifting every period by 144\u00b0. This pentagram of Venus is sometimes referred to as the petals of Venus due to the path's visual similarity to a flower.[164]\n\n\nWhen Venus lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of 41\u00a0million\u00a0km (25\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[4][note 3][165]\nBecause of the decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year\u00a01 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40\u00a0million\u00a0km (25\u00a0million\u00a0mi); then, there are none for about 60,158 years.[166]\n\n\nWhile Venus approaches Earth the closest, Mercury is more often the closest to Earth of all planets.[167] Venus has the lowest gravitational potential difference to Earth than any other planet, needing the lowest delta-v to transfer between them.[168][169]\n\n\nTidally Venus exerts the third strongest tidal force on Earth, after the Moon and the Sun, though significantly less.[170]\n\n\n\n## Observability[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of the night sky taken from the seashore. A glimmer of sunlight is on the horizon. There are many stars visible. Venus is at the centre, much brighter than any of the stars, and its light can be seen reflected in the ocean.](image)Venus, pictured center-right, is always brighter than all other planets or stars at their maximal brightness, as seen from Earth. Jupiter is visible at the top of the image.\nTo the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).[171] The planet's mean apparent magnitude is \u22124.14 with a standard deviation of 0.31.[18] The brightest magnitude occurs during the crescent phase about one month before or after an inferior conjunction. Venus fades to about magnitude \u22123 when it is backlit by the Sun.[172] The planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight,[173] but is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47\u00b0 of the Sun.[174]\n\n\nVenus \"overtakes\" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun.[4] As it does so, it changes from the \"Evening Star\", visible after sunset, to the \"Morning Star\", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, the other inferior planet, reaches a maximum elongation of only 28\u00b0 and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported \"unidentified flying object\".[175]\n\n\n\n### Phases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phases of Venus\n\n![Diagram illustrating the phases of Venus](image)The phases of Venus and evolution of its apparent diameter\nAs it orbits the Sun, Venus displays phases like those of the Moon in a telescopic view. The planet appears as a small and \"full\" disc when it is on the opposite side of the Sun (at superior conjunction). Venus shows a larger disc and \"quarter phase\" at its maximum elongations from the Sun, and appears at its brightest in the night sky. The planet presents a much larger thin \"crescent\" in telescopic views as it passes along the near side between Earth and the Sun. Venus displays its largest size and \"new phase\" when it is between Earth and the Sun (at inferior conjunction). Its atmosphere is visible through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around it.[174] The phases are clearly visible in a 4\" telescope.[*citation needed*] Although naked eye visibility of Venus's phases is disputed, records exist of observations of its crescent.[176]\n\n\n\n### Daylight apparitions[edit]\n\n\nWhen Venus is sufficiently bright with enough angular distance from the sun, it is easily observed in a clear daytime sky with the naked eye.[177] Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its appearance in the daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg.[178] Another historical daytime observation of the planet took place during the inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4\u00a0March 1865.[179]\n\n\n\n### Transits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transit of Venus\n\n![White disk with a small black dot projected on a screen](image)2012 transit of Venus, projected to a white card by a telescope\nA transit of Venus is the appearance of Venus in front of the Sun, during inferior conjunction. Since the orbit of Venus is slightly inclined relative to Earth's orbit, most inferior conjunctions with Earth, which occur every synodic period of 1.6 years, do not produce a transit of Venus above Earth. Consequently Venus transits above Earth only occur when an inferior conjunction takes place during some days of June or December, the time where the orbits of Venus and Earth cross a straight line with the Sun.[180] This results in Venus transiting above Earth in a sequence of currently 8\u00a0years, 105.5\u00a0years, 8\u00a0years and 121.5\u00a0years, forming cycles of 243\u00a0years.\n\n\nHistorically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Jeremiah Horrocks in 1639 with the first known observation of a Venus transit (after history's first observed planetary transit in 1631, of Mercury).[181]\n\n\nOnly seven Venus transits have been observed so far, since their occurrences were calculated in the 1621 by Johannes Kepler. Captain Cook sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to record the third observed transit of Venus, which subsequently resulted in the exploration of the east coast of Australia.[182][183]\n\n\nThe latest pair was June 8, 2004 and June 5\u20136, 2012. The transit could be watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right equipment and conditions.[184] The preceding pair of transits occurred in December 1874 and December 1882.\n\n\nThe next transit will occur in December 2117 and December 2125.[185]\n\n\n\n### Ashen light[edit]\n\n\nA long-standing mystery of Venus observations is the so-called ashen light\u2014an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.[186][78] The ashen light has often been sighted when Venus is in the evening sky, when the evening terminator of the planet is towards Earth.\n\n\n\n## Observation and exploration history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Observations and explorations of Venus\n\n### Early observation[edit]\n\n\nVenus is in Earth's sky bright enough to be visible without aid, making it one of the star-like classical planets that human cultures have known and identified throughout history, particularly for being the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Sun and the Moon. Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as a single entity;[187] instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star.[187] Nonetheless, a cylinder seal from the Jemdet Nasr period and the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa from the First Babylonian dynasty indicate that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.[188][187][189] In the Old Babylonian period, the planet Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat.[190] The name \"Ninsi'anna\" translates to \"divine lady, illumination of heaven\", which refers to Venus as the brightest visible \"star\". Earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign si4 (= SU, meaning \"to be red\"), and the original meaning may have been \"divine lady of the redness of heaven\", in reference to the colour of the morning and evening sky.[191]\n\n\nThe Chinese historically referred to the morning Venus as \"the Great White\" (*T\u00e0ib\u00e1i* \u592a\u767d) or \"the Opener (Starter) of Brightness\" (*Q\u01d0m\u00edng* \u555f\u660e), and the evening Venus as \"the Excellent West One\" (*Ch\u00e1ngg\u0113ng* \u9577\u5e9a).[192]\n\n\nThe ancient Greeks initially believed Venus to be two separate stars: Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star. Pliny the Elder credited the realization that they were a single object to Pythagoras in the sixth century BC,[193] while Diogenes La\u00ebrtius argued that Parmenides (early fifth century) was probably responsible for this discovery.[194] Though they recognized Venus as a single object, the ancient Romans continued to designate the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer, literally \"Light-Bringer\", and the evening aspect as Vesper,[195] both of which are literal translations of their traditional Greek names.\n\n\nIn the second century, in his astronomical treatise *Almagest*, Ptolemy theorized that both Mercury and Venus were located between the Sun and the Earth. The 11th-century Persian astronomer Avicenna claimed to have observed a transit of Venus (although there is some doubt about it),[196] which later astronomers took as confirmation of Ptolemy's theory.[197] In the 12th century, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah observed \"two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun\"; these were thought to be the transits of Venus and Mercury by 13th-century Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi, though this cannot be true as there were no Venus transits in Ibn Bajjah's lifetime.[198][note 4]\n\n\n\n### Venus and early modern astronomy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIn 1610 Galileo Galilei observed with his telescope that Venus showed phases, despite remaining near the Sun in Earth's sky (first image). This proved that it orbits the Sun and not Earth, as predicted by Copernicus's heliocentric model and disproved Ptolemy's geocentric model (second image).\n\nWhen the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei first observed the planet with a telescope in the early 17th century, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, and when it is closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.[201][202]\n\n\nThe 1639 transit of Venus was accurately predicted by Jeremiah Horrocks and observed by him and his friend, William Crabtree, at each of their respective homes, on 4\u00a0December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar in use at that time).[203]\n\n\n\n![A hand-drawn sequence of images showing Venus passing over the edge of the Sun's disk, leaving an illusory drop of shadow behind](image)The \"black drop effect\" as recorded during the 1769 transit\nThe atmosphere of Venus was discovered in 1761 by Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov.[204][205] Venus's atmosphere was observed in 1790 by German astronomer Johann Schr\u00f6ter. Schr\u00f6ter found when the planet was a thin crescent, the cusps extended through more than 180\u00b0. He correctly surmised this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere. Later, American astronomer Chester Smith Lyman observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction, providing further evidence for an atmosphere.[206] The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schr\u00f6ter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24\u00a0h from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface.[207]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century advances[edit]\n\n\nLittle more was discovered about Venus until the 20th century. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, and it was only with the development of spectroscopic and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed.\n\n\nSpectroscopic observations in the 1900s gave the first clues about the Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been thought.[208]\n\n\nThe first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.[209]\n\n\nIt had been noted that Venus had no discernible oblateness in its disk, suggesting a slow rotation, and some astronomers concluded based on this that it was tidally locked like Mercury was believed to be at the time; but other researchers had detected a significant quantity of heat coming from the planet's nightside, suggesting a quick rotation (a high surface temperature was not suspected at the time), confusing the issue.[210] Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde.\n\n\n\n### Space age[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of missions to Venus\n\nHumanity's first interplanetary spaceflight was achieved in 1961 with the robotic space probe *Venera 1* of the Soviet Venera program flying to Venus, though it lost contact en route.[211]\n\n\nTherefore the first successful interplanetary mission was the *Mariner 2* mission to Venus of the United States' Mariner program, passing on 14 December 1962 at 34,833\u00a0km (21,644\u00a0mi) above the surface of Venus and gathering data on the planet's atmosphere.[212][213]\n\n\nAdditionally radar observations of Venus were first carried out in the 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the actual value.[214]\n\n\n*Venera 3*, launched in 1966, became humanity's first probe and lander to reach and impact another celestial body other than the Moon, but could not return data as it crashed into the surface of Venus. In 1967, *Venera 4* was launched and successfully deployed science experiments in the Venusian atmosphere before impacting. *Venera 4* showed the surface temperature was hotter than *Mariner 2* had calculated, at almost 500\u00a0\u00b0C (932\u00a0\u00b0F), determined that the atmosphere was 95% carbon dioxide (CO  \n2), and discovered that Venus's atmosphere was considerably denser than *Venera 4*'s designers had anticipated.[215]\n\n\nIn an early example of space cooperation the data of *Venera 4* was joined with the 1967 *Mariner 5* data, analysed by a combined Soviet\u2013American science team in a series of colloquia over the following year.[216]\n\n\nOn 15 December 1970, *Venera 7* became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth.[217]\n\n\nIn 1974, *Mariner 10* swung by Venus to bend its path toward Mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds, revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the Venusian atmosphere. This was the first interplanetary gravity assist ever used, a technique which would be used by later probes.\n\n\nRadar observations in the 1970s revealed details of the Venusian surface for the first time. Pulses of radio waves were beamed at the planet using the 300\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0ft) radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory, and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions, designated the Alpha and Beta regions. The observations revealed a bright region attributed to mountains, which was called Maxwell Montes.[218] These three features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)First view and first clear 180-degree panorama of Venus's surface as well as any other planet than Earth (1975, Soviet *Venera\u00a09* lander). Black-and-white image of barren, black, slate-like rocks against a flat sky. The ground and the probe are the focus.\nIn 1975, the Soviet *Venera 9* and *10* landers transmitted the first images from the surface of Venus, which were in black and white. NASA obtained additional data with the Pioneer Venus project that consisted of two separate missions:[219] the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe and Pioneer Venus Orbiter, orbiting Venus between 1978 and 1992.[220] In 1982 the first colour images of the surface were obtained with the Soviet *Venera\u00a013* and *14* landers. After *Venera 15* and *16* operated between 1983 and 1984 in orbit, conducting detailed mapping of 25% of Venus's terrain (from the north pole to 30\u00b0N latitude), the successful Soviet Venera program came to a close.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)Global topographic map of Venus, with all probe landings marked\nIn 1985 the Vega program with its *Vega 1* and *Vega 2* missions carried the last entry probes and carried the first ever extraterrestrial aerobots for the first time achieving atmospheric flight outside Earth by employing inflatable balloons.\n\n\nBetween 1990 and 1994, *Magellan* operated in orbit until deorbiting, mapping the surface of Venus. Furthermore, probes like *Galileo* (1990),[222] *Cassini\u2013Huygens* (1998/1999), and *MESSENGER* (2006/2007) visited Venus with flybys flying to other destinations.\nIn April 2006, *Venus Express*, the first dedicated Venus mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), entered orbit around Venus. *Venus Express* provided unprecedented observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded the *Venus Express* mission in December 2014 deorbiting it in January 2015.[223]\n\n\nIn 2010, the first successful interplanetary solar sail spacecraft IKAROS traveled to Venus for a flyby.\n\n\n\n### Active and future missions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of missions to Venus \u00a7\u00a0Future missions\n\n![](image)WISPR visible light footage (2021) of the nightside, showing the hot faintly glowing surface, and its Aphrodite Terra as large dark patch, through the clouds, which prohibit such observations on the dayside when they are illuminated.[224][225]\nAs of 2023, the only active mission at Venus is Japan's *Akatsuki*, having achieved orbital insertion on 7\u00a0December 2015. Additionally, several flybys by other probes have been performed and studied Venus on their way, including NASA's Parker Solar Probe, and ESA's Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo.\n\n\nThere are currently several probes under development as well as multiple proposed missions still in their early conceptual stages.\n\n\nVenus has been identified for future research as an important case for understanding:\n\n\n\n* the origins of the solar system and Earth, and if systems and planets like ours are common or rare in the universe.\n* how planetary bodies evolve from their primordial states to today's diverse objects.\n* the development of conditions leading to habitable environments and life.[226]\n\n\n## Search for life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life on Venus\n\nSpeculation on the possibility of life on Venus's surface decreased significantly after the early 1960s when it became clear that conditions were extreme compared to those on Earth. Venus's extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressure make water-based life, as currently known, unlikely.\n\n\nSome scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the cooler, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.[227][228][229] Such speculations go back to 1967, when Carl Sagan and Harold J. Morowitz suggested in a *Nature* article that tiny objects detected in Venus's clouds might be organisms similar to Earth's bacteria (which are of approximately the same size):\n\n\n\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the clouds of Venus are a different story altogether. As was pointed out some years ago, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight\u2014the prerequisites for photosynthesis\u2014are plentiful in the vicinity of the clouds.[230]\nIn August 2019, astronomers led by Yeon Joo Lee reported that long-term pattern of absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of the planet Venus caused by \"unknown absorbers\", which may be chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere of the planet, affect the climate.[75] Their light absorbance is almost identical to that of micro-organisms in Earth's clouds. Similar conclusions have been reached by other studies.[231]\n\n\nIn September 2020, a team of astronomers led by Jane Greaves from Cardiff University announced the likely detection of phosphine, a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the Venusian surface or atmosphere, in the upper levels of the planet's clouds.[232][57][56][233][234] One proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms.[235] The phosphine was detected at heights of at least 30 miles above the surface, and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles. The discovery prompted NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of Venus, describing the phosphine find as \"the most significant development yet in building the case for life off Earth\".[236][237]\n\n\nSubsequent analysis of the data-processing used to identify phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus has raised concerns that the detection-line may be an artefact. The use of a 12th-order polynomial fit may have amplified noise and generated a false reading (see Runge's phenomenon). Observations of the atmosphere of Venus at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which a phosphine absorption line would be expected did not detect phosphine.[238] By late October 2020, re-analysis of data with a proper subtraction of background did not show a statistically significant detection of phosphine.[239][240][241]\n\n\nMembers of the team around Greaves, are working as part of a project by the MIT to send with the rocket company Rocket Lab the first private interplanetary space craft, to look for organics by entering the atmosphere of Venus with a probe, set to launch in January 2025.[242]\n\n\n\n### Planetary protection[edit]\n\n\nThe Committee on Space Research is a scientific organization established by the International Council for Science. Among their responsibilities is the development of recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination. For this purpose, space missions are categorized into five groups. Due to the harsh surface environment of Venus, Venus has been under the planetary protection category two.[243] This indicates that there is only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations.\n\n\n\n## Human presence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of missions to Venus\n\nVenus is the place of the first interplanetary human presence, mediated through robotic missions, with the first successful landings on another planet and extraterrestrial body other than the Moon. Currently in orbit is Akatsuki, and other probes routinely use Venus for gravity assist maneuvers capturing some data about Venus on the way.[244]\n\n\nThe only nation that has sent lander probes to the surface of Venus has been the Soviet Union,[note 5] which has been used by Russian officials to call Venus a \"Russian planet\".[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Crewed flight[edit]\n\n\nStudies of routes for crewed missions to Mars have since the 1960s proposed opposition missions instead of direct conjunction missions with Venus gravity assist flybys, demonstrating that they should be quicker and safer missions to Mars, with better return or abort flight windows, and less or the same amount of radiation exposure from the flight as direct Mars flights.[247][248]\n\n\nEarly in the space age the Soviet Union and the United States proposed the TMK-MAVR and Manned Venus flyby crewed flyby missions to Venus, though they were never realized.\n\n\n\n### Habitation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colonization of Venus and Floating cities and islands in fiction \u00a7\u00a0Venus\n\n![](image)Artist's rendering of a NASA High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) crewed floating outpost on Venus\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus are inhospitable, the atmospheric pressure, temperature, and solar and cosmic radiation 50\u00a0km above the surface are similar to those at Earth's surface.[132][131] With this in mind, Soviet engineer Sergey Zhitomirskiy (\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0416\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, 1929\u20132004) in 1971[249][250] and NASA aerospace engineer Geoffrey A. Landis in 2003[251] suggested the use of aerostats for crewed exploration and possibly for permanent \"floating cities\" in the Venusian atmosphere, an alternative to the popular idea of living on planetary surfaces such as Mars.[252][253] Among the many engineering challenges for any human presence in the atmosphere of Venus are the corrosive amounts of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.[251]\n\n\nNASA's High Altitude Venus Operational Concept is a mission concept that proposed a crewed aerostat design.\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venus in culture\n\n![](image)Venus is portrayed just to the right of the large cypress tree in Vincent van Gogh's 1889 painting *The Starry Night*.[254][255]\nVenus is a primary feature of the night sky, and so has been of remarkable importance in mythology, astrology and fiction throughout history and in different cultures.\n\n\nThe English name of Venus was originally the ancient Roman name for it. Romans named Venus after their goddess of love, who in turn was based on the ancient Greek goddess of love Aphrodite,[256] who was herself based on the similar Sumerian religion goddess Inanna (which is Ishtar in Akkadian religion), all of whom were associated with the planet.[257][258] The weekday of the planet and these goddesses is Friday, named after the Germanic goddess Frigg, who has been associated with the Roman goddess Venus.\n\n\n\n![](image)The eight-pointed star a symbol used in some cultures for Venus, and sometimes combined into a star and crescent arrangement. Here the eight pointed star is the Star of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus goddess, alongside the solar disk of her brother Shamash and the crescent moon of their father Sin on a boundary stone of Meli-Shipak II, dating to the twelfth century BC.\n\nSeveral hymns praise Inanna in her role as the goddess of the planet Venus.[187][258][257] Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna's movements may correspond with the movements of the planet Venus in the sky.[187] The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature.[187] In *Inanna's Descent to the Underworld*, unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East.[187] An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for *Kur*, what could be presumed to be, the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West.[187] In *Inanna and Shukaletuda* and *Inanna's Descent into the Underworld* appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus.[187] In *Inanna and Shukaletuda*, Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons.[259] In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.[187]\n\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks possibly knew by the second millennium BC or at the latest by the Late Period, under mesopotamian influence that the morning star and an evening star were one and the same.[260][261] The Egyptians knew the morning star as *Tioumoutiri* and the evening star as *Ouaiti*.[262] They depicted Venus at first as a phoenix or heron (see Bennu),[260] calling it \"the crosser\" or \"star with crosses\",[260] associating it with Osiris, and later depicting it two-headed with human or falco heads, and associated it with Horus,[261] son of Isis (which during the even later Hellenistic period was together with Hathor identified with Aphrodite). The Greeks used the names *Ph\u014dsphoros* (\u03a6\u03c9\u03c3\u03d5\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"light-bringer\" (whence the element phosphorus; alternately *\u0112\u014dsphoros* (\u1f28\u03c9\u03c3\u03d5\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"dawn-bringer\"), for the morning star, and *Hesperos* (\u1f1d\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"Western one\", for the evening star,[263] both children of dawn Eos and therefore grandchildren of Aphrodite. Though by the Roman era they were recognized as one celestial object, known as \"the star of Venus\", the traditional two Greek names continued to be used, though usually translated to Latin as *L\u016bcifer* and *Vesper*.[263][264]\n\n\nClassical poets such as Homer, Sappho, Ovid and Virgil spoke of the star and its light.[265] Poets such as William Blake, Robert Frost, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth wrote odes to it.[266]\n\n\nIn India, Shukra Graha (\"the planet Shukra\") is named after the powerful saint Shukra. *Shukra* which is used in Indian Vedic astrology[267] means \"clear, pure\" or \"brightness, clearness\" in Sanskrit. One of the nine Navagraha, it is held to affect wealth, pleasure and reproduction; it was the son of Bhrgu, preceptor of the Daityas, and guru of the Asuras.[268] The word *Shukra* is also associated with semen, or generation.\n\n\nVenus is known as Kejora in Indonesian and Malaysian Malay.\n\n\nIn Chinese the planet is called J\u012bn-x\u012bng (\u91d1\u661f), the golden planet of the metal element. Modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the \"metal star\" (\u91d1\u661f), based on the Five elements.[269][270][271][272]\n\n\nThe Maya considered Venus to be the most important celestial body after the Sun and Moon. They called it *Chac ek*,[273] or *Noh Ek*', \"the Great Star\".[274] The cycles of Venus were important to their calendar and were described in some of their books such as *Maya Codex of Mexico* and *Dresden Codex.*\n\n\n\n### Modern culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Venus in fiction\n\nWith the invention of the telescope, the idea that Venus was a physical world and a possible destination began to take form.\n\n\nThe impenetrable Venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was often depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans.[275] The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed reality to be quite different and brought this particular genre to an end.[276] As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.[277]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venus symbol\n\n![](image)\nThe symbol of a circle with a small cross beneath is the so-called Venus symbol, gaining its name for being used as the astronomical symbol for Venus. The symbol is of ancient Greek origin, and represents more generally femininity, adopted by biology as gender symbol for female,[278][279][280] like the Mars symbol for male and sometimes the Mercury symbol for hermaphrodite. This gendered association of Venus and Mars has been used to pair them heteronormatively, describing women and men stereotypically as being so different that they can be understood as coming from different planets, an understanding popularized in 1992 by the book titled *Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus*.[281][282]\n\n\nThe Venus symbol was also used in Western alchemy representing the element copper (like the symbol of Mercury is also the symbol of the element mercury),[279][280] and since polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity the symbol for Venus has sometimes been called Venus mirror, representing the mirror of the goddess, although this origin has been discredited as an unlikely origin.[279][280]\n\n\nBeside the Venus symbol, many other symbols have been associated with Venus, other common ones are the crescent or particularly the star, as with the Star of Ishtar.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Solar System portal\n* ![](image)Outer space portal\n* ![](image)Astronomy portal\n\n\n* Outline of Venus\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n* Venus zone\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Misstated as \"Ganiki Chasma\" in the press release and scientific publication.[116]\n2. **^** The equatorial speed of Earth is given as both about 1674.4\u00a0km/h and 1669.8\u00a0km/h by reliable sources. The simplest way to determine the correct figure is to multiply Earth's radius of 6378137 m (WGS84) and Earth's angular speed, 7.2921150\u00d710\u22125 rad/s,[143] yielding 465.1011 m/s = 1674.364\u00a0km/h. The incorrect figure of 1669.8\u00a0km/h is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by 24\u00a0h. But the correct speed must be relative to inertial space, so the stellar day of 86164.098903691 s/3600 = 23.934472 h (23 h 56 m 4.0989 s) must be used.[144] Thus 2\u03c0(6378.137\u00a0km)/23.934472 h = 1674.364\u00a0km/h.[145]\n3. **^** It is important to be clear about the meaning of \"closeness\". In the astronomical literature, the term \"closest planets\" often refers to the two planets that approach each other the most closely. In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. Essentially because Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is \"closest to Earth when averaged over time\". However, using this time-average definition of \"closeness\", it turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to *all* other planets in the solar system. For that reason, arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme \"More or Less\" explains the different notions of proximity well.[165]\n4. **^** Several claims of transit observations made by medieval Islamic astronomers have been shown to be sunspots.[199] Avicenna did not record the date of his observation. There was a transit of Venus within his lifetime, on 24 May 1032, although it is questionable whether it would have been visible from his location.[200]\n5. **^** The American Pioneer Venus Multiprobe has brought the only non-Soviet probes to enter the atmosphere, as atmospheric entry probes only briefly signals were received from the surface.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Venusian\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\n\n\nEarth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76\u00a0\u00b0C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.\n\n\nEarth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000\u00a0km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400\u00a0km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.\n\n\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth with the exception of Antarctica. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Modern English word  *Earth* developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled *eor\u00f0e*.[24] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as \\**er\u00fe\u014d*. In its earliest attestation, the word *eor\u00f0e* was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin *terra* and Greek \u03b3\u1fc6 *g\u0113*: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tell\u016bs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included J\u00f6r\u00f0 ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[25]\n\n\nHistorically, *earth* has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as \"the globe\" was expressed as *the* earth. By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and *the earth* was also written *the Earth*, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as *Earth*, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though *earth* and forms with *the* remain common.[24] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (for example, \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by *the* (for example, \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"[26]\n\n\nOccasionally, the name *Terra* /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259/ is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[27] while in poetry *Tellus* /\u02c8t\u025bl\u0259s/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[28] *Terra* is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish *Tierra* and the French *Terre*). The Latinate form *G\u00e6a* or *Gaea* (English: /\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0.\u0259/) of the Greek poetic name *Gaia* (\u0393\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1; Ancient Greek: [\u0261\u00e2i\u032f.a] or [\u0261\u00e2j.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling *Gaia* has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /\u02c8\u0261a\u026a.\u0259/ rather than the more classical English /\u02c8\u0261e\u026a.\u0259/.[29]\n\n\nThere are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From *Earth* itself comes *earthly*. From the Latin *Terra* comes *terran* /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259n/,[30] terrestrial /t\u0259\u02c8r\u025bstri\u0259l/,[31] and (via French) *terrene* /t\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0n/,[32] and from the Latin *Tellus* comes *tellurian* /t\u025b\u02c8l\u028a\u0259ri\u0259n/[33] and *telluric*.[34]\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Earth and Timeline of natural history\n\n### Formation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early Earth and Hadean\n\n![](image)An artist's impression of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of which Earth and other Solar System bodies were formed\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002  \n\u22120.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[35] By 4.54\u00b10.04\u00a0Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[36] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[37]\n\n\nEstimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.[38] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[39] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[40][41] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8\u00a0Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[42]\n\n\n\n### After formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geological history of Earth\n\n![](image)*Pale orange dot*, an artist's impression of Early Earth, featuring its tinted orange methane-rich early atmosphere[43]\nEarth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[44] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[45] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[46] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[47] By 3.5\u00a0Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[48]\n\n\nAs the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust.[49] The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4\u00a0Ga, only 140\u00a0Ma after Earth's formation.[50] There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance:[51] (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day,[52] which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists,[53][54] which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.[55]\n\n\nNew continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750\u00a0Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600\u2013540\u00a0Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180\u00a0Ma.[56]\n\n\nThe most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40\u00a0Ma,[57] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3\u00a0Ma.[58] High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[59] The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.[60]\n\n\n\n### Origin of life and evolution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Origin of life, Earliest known life forms, and History of life\n\n![](image)Artist's impression of the Archean, the eon after Earth's formation, featuring round stromatolites, which are early oxygen-producing forms of life from billions of years ago. After the Late Heavy Bombardment, Earth's crust had cooled, its water-rich barren surface is marked by continents and volcanoes, with the Moon still orbiting Earth half as close than today, appearing 2.8 times larger and producing strong tides.[61]\nChemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[62] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[63] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[64] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[65] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48\u00a0billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[66] biogenic graphite found in 3.7\u00a0billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[67] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1\u00a0billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[68][69] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[70][71]\n\n\nDuring the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539\u00a0Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"Snowball Earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[72][73] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535\u00a0Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones.[74] Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66\u00a0Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66\u00a0Mys, and several million years ago an African ape species gained the ability to stand upright.[75][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[76]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Future of Earth\n\nSee also: Global catastrophic risk\n![A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun](image)Conjectured illustration of the scorched Earth after the Sun has entered the red giant phase, about 5\u20137 billion years from nowEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1\u00a0billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5\u00a0billion years by 40%.[77] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10\u00a0ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100\u2013900\u00a0million years.[78][79] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[80] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100\u00a0\u00b0C (212\u00a0\u00b0F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[81] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[81][82]\n\n\nThe Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5\u00a0billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1\u00a0AU (150\u00a0million\u00a0km; 93\u00a0million\u00a0mi), about 250 times its present radius.[77][83] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7\u00a0AU (250\u00a0million\u00a0km; 160\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[77]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Geophysics\n\n### Size and shape[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Figure of the Earth\n\nFurther information: Earth radius, Earth's circumference, Earth curvature, and Geomorphology\n\nSee also: List of highest mountains on Earth\n\n![](image)Earth's western hemisphere showing topography relative to Earth's center (instead of to mean sea level, as in common topographic maps)\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium,[84] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918\u00a0mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.\n\n\nDue to Earth's rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its Equator; its diameter is 43 kilometers (27\u00a0mi) longer there than at its poles.[85][86]\nEarth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. Though the largest local variations, like the Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level),[87] only shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%.[n 5][89] Since Earth's surface is farthest out from Earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,384.4\u00a0km or 3,967.1\u00a0mi) is its farthest point out.[90][91]\nParallel to the rigid land topography the Ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.[92]\n\n\nTo measure the local variation of Earth's topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a shape called a geoid. Such a geoid shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but gravitational irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level (MSL) as a reference level for topographic measurements.[93]\n\n\n\n### Surface[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Planetary surface, Land cover, Land, Pedosphere, Ocean, Sea, Cryosphere, and Peplosphere\n\n![](image)A composite image of Earth, with its different types of surface discernible: Earth's surface dominating Ocean (blue), Africa with lush (green) to dry (brown) land and Earth's polar ice in the form of Antarctic sea ice (grey) covering the Antarctic or Southern Ocean and the Antarctic ice sheet (white) covering Antarctica.\nEarth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, Earth's shape is an idealized spheroid \u2013 a squashed sphere \u2013 with a surface area of about 510\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (197\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\n\nMost of Earth's surface is ocean water: 70.8% or 361\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (139\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[94] This vast pool of salty water is often called the *world ocean*,[95][96] and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world[97][98] or ocean world.[99][100] Indeed, in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely.[101] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust, but to a lesser extent with shelf seas also shelves of the continental crust. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes,[85] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.\n\n\nAt Earth's polar regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming polar ice caps.\n\n\nEarth's land covers 29.2%, or 149\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (58\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass).[102][103][104] These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of \u2212418\u00a0m (\u22121,371\u00a0ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797\u00a0m (2,615\u00a0ft).[105]\n\n\nLand can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation,[106] but ice sheets (10%,[107] not including the equally large land under permafrost)[108] or cold as well as hot deserts (33%)[109] occupy also considerable amounts of it.\n\n\nThe pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[110][111] Earth has an estimated 16.7\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (6.4\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of cropland and 33.5\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (12.9\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of pastureland.[112]\n\n\nThe land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth's crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's lithosphere. Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks.[113] Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Relief of Earth's crust\nEarth's surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth's land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4\u00a0km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level.\n\n\nEarth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Plate tectonics\n\n![Shows the extent and boundaries of tectonic plates, with superimposed outlines of the continents they support](image)Earth's major plates, which are:[117]* Pacific Plate\n* African Plate[n 6]\n* North American Plate\n* Eurasian Plate\n* Antarctic Plate\n* Indo-Australian Plate\n* South American Plate\n\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur.[118] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[119]\n\n\nAs the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100\u00a0Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200\u00a0Ma old.[120][121] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030\u00a0Ma,[122] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400\u00a0Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.[50]\n\n\nThe seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55\u00a0Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75\u00a0mm/a (3.0\u00a0in/year)[123] and the Pacific Plate moving 52\u201369\u00a0mm/a (2.0\u20132.7\u00a0in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6\u00a0mm/a (0.42\u00a0in/year).[124]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Internal structure of Earth\n\n\n\nGeologic layers of Earth[125]\n| ![](image)Illustration of Earth's cutaway, not to scale\n |\n| Depth[126](km) | Component layer name\n | Density(g/cm3) |\n| 0\u201360\n | Lithosphere[n 7] | \u2014\n |\n| 0\u201335\n | Crust[n 8] | 2.2\u20132.9\n |\n| 35\u2013660\n | Upper mantle | 3.4\u20134.4\n |\n| 660\u20132890\n | Lower mantle | 3.4\u20135.6\n |\n| 100\u2013700\n | Asthenosphere | \u2014\n |\n| 2890\u20135100\n | Outer core | 9.9\u201312.2\n |\n| 5100\u20136378\n | Inner core | 12.8\u201313.1\n |\n\n\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity.[127] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7\u00a0mi) under the oceans to 30\u201350\u00a0km (19\u201331\u00a0mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.[128]\n\n\nBeneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660\u00a0km (250 and 410\u00a0mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.[129] Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1\u20130.5\u00b0 per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed.[130] The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.\nDensity increases with depth, as described in the table on the right.\n\n\nAmong the Solar System's planetary-sized objects Earth is the object with the highest density.\n\n\n\n### Chemical composition[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Abundance of elements on Earth\n\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97\u00d71024\u00a0kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[131][49] The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.[132][131]\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's internal heat budget\n\n![](image)Global map of heat flow from Earth's interior to the surface of Earth's crust, mostly along the oceanic ridges\nThe major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.[133] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000\u00a0\u00b0C (10,830\u00a0\u00b0F),[134] and the pressure could reach 360\u00a0GPa (52\u00a0million\u00a0psi).[135] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3\u00a0Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.[136][137]\n\n\nThe mean heat loss from Earth is 87\u00a0mW m\u22122, for a global heat loss of 4.42\u00d71013\u00a0W.[138] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts.[139] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.[140]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gravity of Earth\n\nThe gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8\u00a0m/s2 (32\u00a0ft/s2). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's magnetic field\n\n![Diagram showing the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetosphere. The lines are swept back in the anti-solar direction under the influence of the solar wind.](image)Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, with the solar wind flows from left to right\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05\u00d710\u22125 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79\u00d71022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average).[142] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.[143][144]\n\n\nThe extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.[145] Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.[146] Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates.[147][148] The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,[149] and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.[150][151]\n\n\nDuring magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.[152]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Earth's rotation\n\n![](image)Satellite time lapse imagery of Earth's rotation showing axis tilt\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun\u2014its mean solar day\u2014is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[153] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.[154][155]\n\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its *stellar day* by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[2][n 9] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90\u00b0 on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s).[2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4\u00a0ms.[156]\n\n\nApart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15\u00b0/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Orbit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Earth's orbit and Earth's location\n\n![](image)Exaggerated illustration of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, marking that the orbital extreme points (apoapsis and periapsis) are not the same as the four seasonal extreme points (equinox and solstice)\nEarth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System. Earth's average orbital distance is about 150\u00a0million\u00a0km (93\u00a0million\u00a0mi), which is the basis for the Astronomical Unit and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon.\n\n\nEarth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1\u00b0/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12\u00a0hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24\u00a0hours\u2014a solar day\u2014for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.\n\n\nThe orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78\u00a0km/s (107,200\u00a0km/h; 66,600\u00a0mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742\u00a0km (7,918\u00a0mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000\u00a0km (239,000\u00a0mi), in about 3.5 hours.[3]\n\n\nThe Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32\u00a0days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth\u2013Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53\u00a0days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth\u2013Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to \u00b15.1 degrees against the Earth\u2013Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.[3][159]\n\n\nThe Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5\u00a0million\u00a0km (930,000\u00a0mi) in radius.[160][n 10] This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.[160] Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000\u00a0light-years from its center. It is about 20\u00a0light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.[161]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt and seasons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Axial tilt \u00a7\u00a0Earth\n\n![](image)Earth's axial tilt causing different angles of seasonal illumination at different orbital positions around the Sun\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\u00b0[2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.[162] Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.[163][164]\n\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.[165]\n\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6\u00a0years.[166] The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.[167]\n\n\nIn modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.[168][n 11] Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.[169]\n\n\n\n## Earth\u2013Moon system[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Satellite system (astronomy)\n\n### Moon[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Moon, Lunar theory, and Orbit of the Moon\n\n![](image)Earth and the Moon as seen from Mars in an image taken by NASA's *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* on 22 April 2022\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto.[170][171] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.[172] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.[40]\n\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth.[173] The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.[174] As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases.[175] Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38\u00a0mm/a (1.5\u00a0in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23\u00a0\u00b5s/yr\u2014add up to significant changes.[176] During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620\u00a0Ma) there were 400\u00b17 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9\u00b10.4 hours.[177]\n\n\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.[178] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.[179][180]\n\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.[158] This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.[181]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### Asteroids and artificial satellites[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Near-Earth object and Claimed moons of Earth\n\n![](image)A computer-generated image mapping the prevalence of artificial satellites and space debris around Earth in geosynchronous and low Earth orbit\nEarth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa.[184][185] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun.[186] The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.[187]\n\n\nAs of September\u00a02021[update], there are 4,550 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth.[188] There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris.[n 12] Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.[189]\n\n\n\n## Hydrosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrosphere\n\n![](image)A view of Earth with its global ocean and cloud cover, which dominate Earth's surface and hydrosphere. At Earth's polar regions, its hydrosphere forms larger areas of ice cover\nEarth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution.\nMost of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Nevertheless, Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft). The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35\u00d71018\u00a0metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (139.7\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with a mean depth of 3,682\u00a0m (12,080\u00a0ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332\u00a0billion\u00a0km3 (320\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0mi).[190] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8\u00a0km (1.68 to 1.74\u00a0mi).[191] About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.[192][193] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.[194] The remaining 30% is ground water, 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land)[195] and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere, biological binding, etc. .[196][197]\n\n\nIn Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms.[198] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.[199]\n\n\nThe average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35\u00a0grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[200] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[201] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.[202] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.[203] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation.[204]\n\n\nThe abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water.[205] Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.[206]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Earth\n\n![](image)A view of Earth with different layers of its atmosphere visible: the troposphere with its clouds casting shadows, a band of stratospheric blue sky at the horizon, and a line of green airglow of the lower thermosphere around an altitude of 100\u00a0km, at the edge of space\nThe atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325\u00a0kPa (14.696\u00a0psi),[207] with a scale height of about 8.5\u00a0km (5.3\u00a0mi).[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[207] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%[207] but averages about 1%.[3] Clouds cover around two thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land.[208] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) at the poles to 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.[209]\n\n\nEarth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7\u00a0Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen\u2013oxygen atmosphere of today.[63] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[210] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[211] This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F), in contrast to the current +15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F),[212] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[213]\n\n\n\n### Weather and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Weather and Climate\n\n![](image)\nThe ITCZ's band of clouds over the Eastern Pacific and the Americas as seen from space\n![](image)\nWorldwide K\u00f6ppen climate classifications\n\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.[214] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere.[215] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.[216]\n\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.[217] Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[218]\n\n\nEarth receives 1361\u00a0W/m2 of\u00a0solar irradiance.[219][220] The amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C (0.7\u00a0\u00b0F) per degree of latitude from the equator.[221] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.[222]\n\n\nFurther factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.[223] Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land.[224] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land.[225] Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.[226]\n\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.[216] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.[227]\n\n\nThe commonly used K\u00f6ppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.[217] The K\u00f6ppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.[228] Surface air temperature can rise to around 55\u00a0\u00b0C (131\u00a0\u00b0F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as \u221289\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128\u00a0\u00b0F) in Antarctica.[229][230]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earth's atmosphere as it appears from space, as bands of different colours at the horizon. From the bottom, afterglow illuminates the troposphere in orange with silhouettes of clouds, and the stratosphere in white and blue. Next the mesosphere (pink area) extends to just below the edge of space at one hundred kilometers and the pink line of airglow of the lower thermosphere (invisible), which hosts green and red aurorae over several hundred kilometers.\nThe upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere,[231] is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[211] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[232] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, defined as 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[233]\n\n\nThermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[234] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.[235] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.[236] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.[237]\n\n\n\n## Life on Earth[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Biosphere and History of life\n\n![](image)An animation of the changing density of productive vegetation on land (low in brown; heavy in dark green) and phytoplankton at the ocean surface (low in purple; high in yellow)\nEarth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed.\n\n\nEarth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere.[238] Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing changes like the Great Oxidation Event.[239]\n\n\nEarth's life has over time greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes, which are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals.[240] The different biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths, planetary temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity. Earth's species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions. While freezing polar regions and high altitudes, or extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life.[241]\n\n\nEarth provides liquid water\u2014an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism.[242] Plants and other organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.[243]\n\n\nExtreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.[244] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.[245] Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.[246] Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming.[247] This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[248]\n\n\n\n## Human geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human geography\n\nSee also: World\n\n![](image)A composite image of artificial light emissions at night on a map of Earth\nOriginating from earlier primates in eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land.[249] In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.\n\n\nHuman population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s,[250] and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century.[251] Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.[251]\n\n\nDistribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth,[252] partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world's land mass, with 68% of the world's land mass being in the Northern Hemisphere.[253] Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century.[254]\n\n\nBeyond Earth's surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only special purpose deep underground and underwater presence, and a few space stations. Human population virtually completely remains on Earth's surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.[255][256]\n\n\nEarth has been subject to extensive human settlement, and humans have developed diverse societies and cultures. Most of Earth's land has been territorially claimed since the 19th century by sovereign states (countries) separated by political borders, and more than 200 such states exist today,[257] with only parts of Antarctica and few small regions remaining unclaimed.[258] Most of these states together form the United Nations, the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization,[259] which extends human governance over the ocean and Antarctica, and therefore all of Earth.\n\n\n\n### Natural resources and land use[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Natural resource and Land use\n\n![](image)Earth's land use for human agriculture\nEarth has resources that have been exploited by humans.[260] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales.[261] Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.[262] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.[263] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.[264] These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.[265]\n\n\nEarth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.[266] In 2019, 39\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (15\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (4.6\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) was shrub and grassland, 40\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (15\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (4.2\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were cultivated as croplands.[267] Of the 12\u201314% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015.[268] Humans use building materials to construct shelters.[269]\n\n\n\n### Humans and the environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human impact on the environment and Climate change\n\n![The graph from 1880 to 2020 shows natural drivers exhibiting fluctuations of about 0.3 degrees Celsius. Human drivers steadily increase by 0.3 degrees over 100 years to 1980, then steeply by 0.8 degrees more over the past 40 years.](image)Change in average surface air temperature and drivers for that change. Human activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability.[270]\nHuman activities have impacted Earth's environments. Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth's energy budget and climate.[247][271] It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C (2.2\u00a0\u00b0F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline.[272] This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[248]\n\n\nThe concept of planetary boundaries was introduced to quantify humanity's impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five have been crossed: Biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are thought to have passed the safe threshold.[273][274] As of 2018, no country meets the basic needs of its population without transgressing planetary boundaries. It is thought possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within sustainable levels of resource use.[275]\n\n\n\n## Cultural and historical viewpoint[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Earth in culture and Earth symbol\n\n![Woman seeing the Earth from space through a window](image)Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a NASA astronaut, observing Earth from the *Cupola* module at the International Space Station on 11 September 2010\nHuman cultures have developed many views of the planet.[276] The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, ![\ud83d\udf28](image),[277] representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger, ![\u2641](image). Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity.[278] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.[278] The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.[279][280][281]\n\n\nImages of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.[282][283] In particular, this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation,[284] humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally,[285] acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth's environments.\n\n\nScientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides.[286][287] Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.[288]\n\n\nIt was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.[289] Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400\u00a0million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.[290][291]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Celestial sphere\n* Earth phase\n* Earth physical characteristics tables\n* Earth science\n* Extremes on Earth\n* List of Solar System extremes\n* Outline of Earth\n* Table of physical properties of planets in the Solar System\n* Timeline of natural history\n* Timeline of the far future\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** All astronomical quantities vary, both secularly and periodically.

The ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.\n5. **^**  If Earth were shrunk to the size of a billiard ball, some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the Great Plains and the abyssal plains, would feel smoother.[88]\n6. **^** Including the Somali Plate, which is being formed out of the African Plate.

The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname \"**the Red Planet**\".[21][22] Mars's radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5\u00a0km (2,106\u00a0mi). The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide, and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.\n\n\nGeologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping across the landscape and marsquakes (Martian analog to earthquakes) trembling underneath the ground. The surface of Mars hosts a large shield volcano (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). Mars's significant orbital eccentricity and axial tilt cause large seasonal changes to the polar ice caps' coverage and temperature swings between \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212166\u00a0\u00b0F) to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) on the surface. A Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years.\n\n\nLike the other planets in the Solar System, Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to 3.2\u20132 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues to the present, was marked by the wind's influence on geological processes. It is unknown whether life has ever existed on Mars.\n\n\nMars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and thus has been known from ancient times. Its high-contrast albedo features make it a common subject for viewing with a telescope. Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the first flyby by the *Mariner 4* probe in 1965, the first Mars orbiter by the *Mars 2* probe in 1971, and the first landing by *Viking 1* in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11 active probes orbiting Mars or at the Martian surface. Currently, Mars is an attractive target for the first future interplanetary human missions.\n\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geological history of Mars\n\nScientists have theorized that during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created as the result of a random process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are much more common on Mars than on Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.[23]\n\n\nAfter the formation of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called \"Late Heavy Bombardment\". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,[24][25][26] whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300\u00a0mi), or roughly four times the size of the Moon's South Pole \u2013 Aitken basin, the largest impact basin yet discovered.[27] This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy, created the smooth Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.[28][29]\n\n\nA 2023 study shows evidence, based on the orbital inclination of Deimos (a small moon of Mars), that Mars may once had a ring system 3.5 billion years to 4 billion years ago.[30] This ring system may have been formed from a moon, 20 times more massive than Phobos, orbiting Mars billions of years ago; and Phobos would be a remnant of that ring.[31][32]\n\n\nThe geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the three primary periods:[33][34]\n\n\n\n* Noachian period: Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5\u00a0billion years ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period. Named after Noachis Terra.[35]\n* Hesperian period: 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9\u00a0billion years ago. The Hesperian period is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains. Named after Hesperia Planum.[35]\n* Amazonian period: between 3.3 and 2.9\u00a0billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars. Named after Amazonis Planitia.[35]\n\n\nGeological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200\u00a0mya. Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20\u00a0Mya, indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions.[36] The *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* has captured images of avalanches.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Mars\n\n![](image)\nComparison: Earth and Mars\nAnimation (00:40) showing major features of Mars\nVideo (01:28) showing how three NASA orbiters mapped the gravity field of Mars\n\nMars is approximately half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land.[2] Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by ferric oxide, or rust.[39] It can look like butterscotch;[40] other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nLike Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.[41][42] Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16\u201317% sulfur.[43] This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as Earth's.[44] The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 kilometres (78\u00a0mi).[44] By comparison, Earth's crust averages 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) in thickness.[45][46]\n\n\nMars is seismically active. In 2019, it was reported that InSight (now offline) had detected and recorded over 450 marsquakes and related events.[47][48] In 2021 it was reported that based on eleven low-frequency marsquakes detected by the *InSight* lander the core of Mars was indeed liquid and had a radius of about 1830\u00b140\u00a0km and a temperature around 1900\u20132000\u00a0K. The Martian core radius is abnormally large, accounting for more than half the radius of Mars and about half the size of Earth's core. To this, it has been suggested that the core contains some amount of lighter elements like oxygen and hydrogen in addition to the iron\u2013nickel alloy and about 15% of sulfur.[49][50]\n\n\nThe core of Mars is overlaid by the rocky mantle, which does not seem to have a thermally insulating layer analogous to the Earth's lower mantle.[50] The Martian mantle appears to be solid down to the depth of about 500\u00a0km, where the low-velocity zone (partially melted asthenosphere) begins.[51] Below the asthenosphere the velocity of seismic waves starts to grow again; and at the depth of about 1050\u00a0km lies the boundary of the transition zone extending down to the core.[50]\n\n\nFurther analysis of data from the InSight lander has suggested that Mars has a liquid core.[52][53] On 25 October 2023, scientists, helped by information from InSight, reported that Mars has a radioactive magma ocean under its crust.[54]\n\n\n\n### Surface geology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Martian soil\n![](image)*Curiosity*'s view of Martian soil and boulders after crossing the \"Dingo Gap\" sand dune\nMars is a terrestrial planet with a surface that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The Martian surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt,[55] although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth, or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found.[56] Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.[57]\n\n\nAlthough Mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field,[58] observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October\u00a02005 (with the help of the *Mars Global Surveyor*), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.[59]\n\n\nThe *Phoenix* lander returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth. They are necessary for growth of plants.[60] Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate,[61][62] concentrations that are toxic to humans.[63][64]\n\n\nStreaks are common across Mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils.[65] Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.[66][67]\n\n\nRadiation levels on the surface are on average 0.64 millisieverts of radiation per day, and significantly less than the radiation of\u00a01.84 millisieverts per day or 22 millirads per day during the flight to and from Mars.[68][69] For comparison the radiation levels in low Earth orbit, where Earth's space stations orbit, are around 0.5 millisieverts of radiation per day.[70] Hellas Planitia has the lowest surface radiation at about 0.342 millisieverts per day, featuring lava tubes southwest of Hadriacus Mons with potentially levels as low as 0.064 millisieverts per day.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography and features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Mars\n\nFurther information: Areoid\n\nSee also: Category:Surface features of Mars\n\n![](image)A MOLA-based topographic map showing highlands (red and orange) dominating the Southern Hemisphere of Mars, lowlands (blue) the northern. Volcanic plateaus delimit regions of the northern plains, whereas the highlands are punctuated by several large impact basins.\nAlthough better remembered for mapping the Moon, Johann Heinrich M\u00e4dler and Wilhelm Beer were the first areographers. They began by establishing that most of Mars's surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet's rotation period. In 1840, M\u00e4dler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars.[72]\n\n\nFeatures on Mars are named from a variety of sources. Albedo features are named for classical mythology. Craters larger than roughly 50\u00a0km are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of Mars. Smaller craters are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than 100,000. Large valleys are named for the word \"Mars\" or \"star\" in various languages; smaller valleys are named for rivers.[73]\n\n\nLarge albedo features retain many of the older names but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, *Nix Olympica* (the snows of Olympus) has become *Olympus Mons* (Mount Olympus).[74] The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian \"continents\" and given names like Arabia Terra (*land of Arabia*) or Amazonis Planitia (*Amazonian plain*). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum.[75] The permanent northern polar ice cap is named Planum Boreum. The southern cap is called Planum Australe.[76]\n\n\nMars's equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its Prime Meridian was specified, as was Earth's (at Greenwich), by choice of an arbitrary point; M\u00e4dler and Beer selected a line for their first maps of Mars in 1830. After the spacecraft *Mariner 9* provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972, a small crater (later called Airy-0), located in the Sinus Meridiani (\"Middle Bay\" or \"Meridian Bay\"), was chosen by Merton Davies, Harold Masursky, and G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs for the definition of 0.0\u00b0 longitude to coincide with the original selection.[77][78][79]\n\n\nBecause Mars has no oceans and hence no \"sea level\", a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as a reference level; this is called the *areoid*[80] of Mars, analogous to the terrestrial geoid.[81] Zero altitude was defined by the height at which there is 610.5\u00a0Pa (6.105\u00a0mbar) of atmospheric pressure.[82] This pressure corresponds to the triple point of water, and it is about 0.6% of the sea level surface pressure on Earth (0.006 atm).[83]\n\n\nFor mapping purposes, the United States Geological Survey divides the surface of Mars into thirty cartographic quadrangles, each named for a classical albedo feature it contains.[84] In April 2023, *The New York Times* reported an updated global map of Mars based on images from the Hope spacecraft.[85] A related, but much more detailed, global Mars map was released by NASA on 16 April 2023.[86]\n\n\n\n### Volcanoes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanology of Mars\n\n![](image)Picture of the largest volcano on Mars, Olympus Mons. It is approximately 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) across.\nThe vast upland region Tharsis contain several extinct volcanoes, which include the shield volcano Olympus Mons (*Mount Olympus*). The edifice is over 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) wide.[87][88] Because the mountain is so large, with complex structure at its edges, giving a definite height to it is difficult. Its local relief, from the foot of the cliffs which form its northwest margin to its peak, is over 21\u00a0km (13\u00a0mi),[88] a little over twice the height of Mauna Kea as measured from its base on the ocean floor. The total elevation change from the plains of Amazonis Planitia, over 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) to the northwest, to the summit approaches 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi),[89] roughly three times the height of Mount Everest, which in comparison stands at just over 8.8 kilometres (5.5\u00a0mi). Consequently, Olympus Mons is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the Solar System; the only known mountain which might be taller is the Rheasilvia peak on the asteroid Vesta, at 20\u201325\u00a0km (12\u201316\u00a0mi).[90]\n\n\n\n### Impact topography[edit]\n\n\nThe dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. It is possible that, four billion years ago, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of Earth's Moon. If this is the case, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars would be the site of an impact crater 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300\u00a0mi) in size, or roughly the area of Europe, Asia, and Australia combined, surpassing Utopia Planitia and the Moon's South Pole\u2013Aitken basin as the largest impact crater in the Solar System.[91][92][93]\n\n\nMars is scarred by a number of impact craters: a total of 43,000 craters with a diameter of 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) or greater have been found.[94] The largest exposed crater is Hellas, which is 2,300 kilometres (1,400\u00a0mi) wide and 7,000 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) deep, and is a light albedo feature clearly visible from Earth.[95][96] There are other notable impact features, such as Argyre, which is around 1,800 kilometres (1,100\u00a0mi) in diameter,[97] and Isidis, which is around 1,500 kilometres (930\u00a0mi) in diameter.[98] Due to the smaller mass and size of Mars, the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth. Mars is located closer to the asteroid belt, so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source. Mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets, *i.e.*, those that lie within the orbit of Jupiter.[99]\n\n\nMartian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted.[100]\n\n\n\n### Tectonic sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Valles Marineris, taken by the *Viking 1* probe\nThe large canyon, Valles Marineris (Latin for \"Mariner Valleys\", also known as Agathodaemon in the old canal maps[101]), has a length of 4,000 kilometres (2,500\u00a0mi) and a depth of up to 7 kilometres (4.3\u00a0mi). The length of Valles Marineris is equivalent to the length of Europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of Mars. By comparison, the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 446 kilometres (277\u00a0mi) long and nearly 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) deep. Valles Marineris was formed due to the swelling of the Tharsis area, which caused the crust in the area of Valles Marineris to collapse. In 2012, it was proposed that Valles Marineris is not just a graben, but a plate boundary where 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of transverse motion has occurred, making Mars a planet with possibly a two-tectonic plate arrangement.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Holes and caves[edit]\n\n\nImages from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) aboard NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter have revealed seven possible cave entrances on the flanks of the volcano Arsia Mons.[104] The caves, named after loved ones of their discoverers, are collectively known as the \"seven sisters\".[105] Cave entrances measure from 100 to 252 metres (328 to 827\u00a0ft) wide and they are estimated to be at least 73 to 96 metres (240 to 315\u00a0ft) deep. Because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves, they may extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface. \"Dena\" is the only exception; its floor is visible and was measured to be 130 metres (430\u00a0ft) deep. The interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids, UV radiation, solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet's surface.[106][107]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Mars\n\n![see caption](image)Edge-on view of Mars atmosphere by *Viking 1* probe\nMars lost its magnetosphere 4\u00a0billion years ago,[108] possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes,[109] so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer.[110] Both *Mars Global Surveyor* and *Mars Express* have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars,[108][111] and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30\u00a0Pa (0.0044\u00a0psi) on Olympus Mons to over 1,155\u00a0Pa (0.1675\u00a0psi) in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600\u00a0Pa (0.087\u00a0psi).[112] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi)[113] above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of Earth's 101.3\u00a0kPa (14.69\u00a0psi). The scale height of the atmosphere is about 10.8 kilometres (6.7\u00a0mi),[114] which is higher than Earth's 6 kilometres (3.7\u00a0mi), because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's.[115]\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water.[2][116][110] The atmosphere is quite dusty, containing particulates about 1.5 \u03bcm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface.[117] It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it.[21] The concentration of methane in the Martian atmosphere fluctuates from about 0.24 ppb during the northern winter to about 0.65 ppb during the summer.[118] Estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6 to 4 years,[119][120] so its presence indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Methane could be produced by non-biological process such as serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars,[121] or by Martian life.[122]\n\n![](image)Escaping atmosphere on Mars (carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen) by MAVEN in UV[123]\nCompared to Earth, its higher concentration of atmospheric CO2 and lower surface pressure may be why sound is attenuated more on Mars, where natural sources are rare apart from the wind. Using acoustic recordings collected by the *Perseverance* rover, researchers concluded that the speed of sound there is approximately 240\u00a0m/s for frequencies below 240\u00a0Hz, and 250\u00a0m/s for those above.[124][125]\n\n\nAuroras have been detected on Mars.[126][127][128] Because Mars lacks a global magnetic field, the types and distribution of auroras there differ from those on Earth;[129] rather than being mostly restricted to polar regions as is the case on Earth, a Martian aurora can encompass the planet.[130] In September 2017, NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled, and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, solar storm in the middle of the month.[130][131]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Mars\n\n![](image)Mars without (on left) and with a global dust storm in July 2001 (on right), as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope\nOf all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212166\u00a0\u00b0F) to highs of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) in equatorial summer.[15] The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure (about 1% that of the atmosphere of Earth), and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil.[132] The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.[133][134]\n\n\nIf Mars had an Earth-like orbit, its seasons would be similar to Earth's because its axial tilt is similar to Earth's. The comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect. Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere and winter in the north, and near aphelion when it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere and summer in the north. As a result, the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case. The summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F).[135]\n\n\nMars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System, reaching speeds of over 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph). These can vary from a storm over a small area, to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and have been shown to increase global temperature.[136]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water on Mars\n\n![](image)The ice-filled Korolev crater near Mars's north pole is estimated to hold about 2,200\u00a0km3 (530\u00a0cu\u00a0mi), comparable in volume to the Great Bear Lake.\nWater in its liquid form cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% that of Earth,[137] except at the lowest of elevations for short periods.[42][138] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[139][140] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be enough to cover the entire surface of the planet with a depth of 11 metres (36\u00a0ft).[141] Large quantities of ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of Mars. Radar data from *Mars Express* and the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* (MRO) show large quantities of ice at both poles,[142][143] and at middle latitudes.[144] The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on 31 July 2008.[145]\n\n\nLandforms visible on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet's surface. Huge linear swathes of scoured ground, known as outflow channels, cut across the surface in about 25 places. These are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers, though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava.[146][147] One of the larger examples, Ma'adim Vallis, is 700 kilometres (430\u00a0mi) long, much greater than the Grand Canyon, with a width of 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) and a depth of 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) in places. It is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in Mars's history.[148] The youngest of these channels is thought to have formed only a few million years ago.[149]\n\n\nElsewhere, particularly on the oldest areas of the Martian surface, finer-scale, dendritic networks of valleys are spread across significant proportions of the landscape. Features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by runoff resulting from precipitation in early Mars history. Subsurface water flow and groundwater sapping may play important subsidiary roles in some networks, but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases.[150]\n\n\nAlong craters and canyon walls, there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the Southern Hemisphere and face the Equator; all are poleward of 30\u00b0 latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice,[151][152] although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust.[153][154] No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active.[152] Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history.[155] Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across a large proportion of the surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.[156] Further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and goethite, both of which sometimes form in the presence of water.[157]\n\n\n\n### Polar caps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Martian polar ice caps\n\n![](image)\nNorth polar early summer water ice cap (1999); a seasonal layer of carbon dioxide ice forms in winter and disappears in summer.\n![](image)\nSouth polar midsummer ice cap (2000); the south cap has a permanent carbon dioxide ice cap covered with water ice.[158]\n\nMars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25\u201330% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice).[159] When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the *Opportunity* rover in 2004.[160]\n\n\nThe caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick. This permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by flat floored, shallow, roughly circular pits, which repeat imaging shows are expanding in some places and retreating in others.[161] The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi),[162] and contains about 1.6\u00a0million cubic kilometres (5.7\u00d71016\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of ice, which, if spread evenly on the cap, would be 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) thick.[163] (This compares to a volume of 2.85\u00a0million cubic kilometres (1.01\u00d71017\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) and a thickness of 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi).[164] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.6\u00a0million cubic km.[165] Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which a recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis effect.[166][167]\n\n\nThe seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology \u2013 especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Observations and findings of water evidence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chronology of discoveries of water on Mars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nProportion of water ice present in the upper meter of the Martian surface for lower (top) and higher (bottom) latitudes\n\nIn 2004, *Opportunity* detected the mineral jarosite. This forms only in the presence of acidic water, showing that water once existed on Mars.[170][171] The *Spirit* rover found concentrated deposits of silica in 2007 that indicated wet conditions in the past, and in December 2011, the mineral gypsum, which also forms in the presence of water, was found on the surface by NASA's Mars rover Opportunity.[172][173][174] It is estimated that the amount of water in the upper mantle of Mars, represented by hydroxyl ions contained within Martian minerals, is equal to or greater than that of Earth at 50\u2013300 parts per million of water, which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 200\u20131,000 metres (660\u20133,280\u00a0ft).[175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maps of buried ice on Mars (26 October 2023)\n![](image)Map of subsurface water ice on Mars (26 October 2023)\nOn 18 March 2013, NASA reported evidence from instruments on the *Curiosity* rover of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of \"Tintina\" rock and \"Sutton Inlier\" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like \"Knorr\" rock and \"Wernicke\" rock.[177][178] Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in), during the rover's traverse from the *Bradbury Landing* site to the *Yellowknife Bay* area in the *Glenelg* terrain.[177] In September 2015, NASA announced that they had found strong evidence of hydrated brine flows in recurring slope lineae, based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes.[179][180][181] These streaks flow downhill in Martian summer, when the temperature is above \u221223\u00a0\u00b0C, and freeze at lower temperatures.[182] These observations supported earlier hypotheses, based on timing of formation and their rate of growth, that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing just below the surface.[183] However, later work suggested that the lineae may be dry, granular flows instead, with at most a limited role for water in initiating the process.[184] A definitive conclusion about the presence, extent, and role of liquid water on the Martian surface remains elusive.[185][186]\n\n\nResearchers suspect much of the low northern plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this theory remains controversial.[187] In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of protium to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium (D/H = 9.3 \u00b1 1.7 10-4) is five to seven times the amount on Earth (D/H = 1.56 10-4), suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the *Curiosity* rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.[188] Near the northern polar cap is the 81.4 kilometres (50.6\u00a0mi) wide Korolev Crater, which the Mars Express orbiter found to be filled with approximately 2,200 cubic kilometres (530\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water ice.[189]\n\n\nIn November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior (which is 12,100 cubic kilometres[190]).[191][192] During observations from 2018 through 2021, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spotted indications of water, probably subsurface ice, in the Valles Marineris canyon system.[193]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit of Mars\n\nSee also: Timekeeping on Mars\n\n![Mars circling the Sun further and slower than Earth](image)Orbit of Mars and other Inner Solar System planets\nMars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230\u00a0million\u00a0km (143\u00a0million\u00a0mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.[194] A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.[2]\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Mars is 25.19\u00b0 relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth.[2] As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.[20]\n\n\nMars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; of the seven other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35\u00a0million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much less than that of Earth today.[195] Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years.[196]\n\n\nMars approaches Earth in a synodic period of 779.94 days. Earth orbits the Sun the closest to Mars's orbit around the Sun, and Mars orbit is the second closest to Earth after the orbit of Venus. Therefore, their closest approaches, the inferior conjunctions, are the second closest for Earth after those with Venus, and the closest for Mars to any other planet. The gravitational potential difference, and thus the delta-v needed to transfer between Mars and Earth is the second lowest for Earth and the lowest for Mars to any other planet, while transfers can possibly be optimized with Venus flybys.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Moons of Mars, Phobos (moon), and Deimos (moon)\n\n![](image)\nEnhanced-color HiRISE image of Phobos, showing a series of mostly parallel grooves and crater chains, with Stickney crater at right\n![](image)\nEnhanced-color HiRISE image of Deimos (not to scale), showing its smooth blanket of regolith\n\nMars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons, Phobos (about 22 kilometres (14\u00a0mi) in diameter) and Deimos (about 12 kilometres (7.5\u00a0mi) in diameter), which orbit close to the planet. The origin of both moons is unclear, although a popular theory states that they were asteroids captured into Martian orbit.[199]\n\n\nBoth satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall and were named after the characters Phobos (the deity of panic and fear) and Deimos (the deity of terror and dread), twins from Greek mythology who accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle.[200] Mars was the Roman equivalent to Ares. In modern Greek, the planet retains its ancient name *Ares* (Aris: *\u0386\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2*).[92]\n\n\nFrom the surface of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear different from that of the Earth's satellite, the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit\u00a0\u2013 where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation\u00a0\u2013 rises as expected in the east, but slowly. Because the orbit of Phobos is below a synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50\u00a0million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.[201]\n\n\nThe origin of the two satellites is not well understood. Their low albedo and carbonaceous chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting a capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point toward a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects, and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early in the history of Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.[202] Mars may have yet-undiscovered moons, smaller than 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330\u00a0ft) in diameter, and a dust ring is predicted to exist between Phobos and Deimos.[203]\n\n\nA third possibility for their origin as satellites of Mars is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior,[204] and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars,[205] point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's satellite. Although the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.[205] It is also possible that Phobos and Deimos were fragments of an older moon, formed by debris from a large impact on Mars, and then destroyed by a more recent impact upon the satellite.[206]\n\n\n\n## Human observations and exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Exploration of Mars and History of Mars observation\n\nThe history of observations of Mars is marked by oppositions of Mars when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.[207]\n\n\n\n### Ancient and medieval observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei was the first to see Mars via telescope.\nThe ancient Sumerians named Mars Nergal, the god of war and plague. During Sumerian times, Nergal was a minor deity of little significance, but, during later times, his main cult center was the city of Nineveh.[208] In Mesopotamian texts, Mars is referred to as the \"star of judgement of the fate of the dead\".[209] The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was also recorded by the ancient Egyptian astronomers and, by 1534 BCE, they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet.[210] By the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations of their behavior. For Mars, they knew that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. They invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets.[211][212] In Ancient Greece, the planet was known as \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.[213] Commonly, the Greek name for the planet now referred to as Mars, was Ares. It was the Romans who named the planet Mars, for their god of war, often represented by the sword and shield of the planet's namesake.[214]\n\n\nIn the fourth century BCE, Aristotle noted that Mars disappeared behind the Moon during an occultation, indicating that the planet was farther away.[215] Ptolemy, a Greek living in Alexandria,[216] attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection later called the *Almagest* (from the Arabic for \"greatest\"), which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.[217] Literature from ancient China confirms that Mars was known by Chinese astronomers by no later than the fourth century BCE.[218] In the East Asian cultures, Mars is traditionally referred to as the \"fire star\" based on the *Wuxing* system.[219][220][221]\n\n\nDuring the seventeenth century A.D., Tycho Brahe measured the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet.[222] From Brahe's observations of Mars, Kepler deduced that the planet orbited the Sun not in a circle, but in an ellipse. Moreover, Kepler showed that Mars sped up as it approached the Sun and slowed down as it moved farther away, in a manner that later physicists would explain as a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.[223]:\u200a433\u2013437 When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments.[224] The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of 13 October 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg.[225] In 1610, Mars was viewed by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope.[226] The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.[227]\n\n\n\n### Martian \"canals\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Martian canals\n\n![](image)A 1962 map of Mars published by the U.S. Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, showing canals snaking through the Martian landscape. At the time, the existence canals was still highly controversial as no close-up pictures of Mars had been taken (until Mariner 4's flyby in 1965).\nBy the 19th century, the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified. On 5 September 1877, a perihelic opposition to Mars occurred. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli used a 22-centimetre (8.7\u00a0in) telescope in Milan to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called *canali*, which were later shown to be an optical illusion. These *canali* were supposedly long, straight lines on the surface of Mars, to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term, which means \"channels\" or \"grooves\", was popularly mistranslated in English as \"canals\".[228][229]\n\n\nInfluenced by the observations, the orientalist Percival Lowell founded an observatory which had 30- and 45-centimetre (12- and 18-in) telescopes. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894, and the following less favorable oppositions. He published several books on Mars and life on the planet, which had a great influence on the public.[230][231] The *canali* were independently observed by other astronomers, like Henri Joseph Perrotin and Louis Thollon in Nice, using one of the largest telescopes of that time.[232][233]\n\n\nThe seasonal changes (consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during Martian summers) in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on Mars, and it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. As bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight *canali* were observed. During observations in 1909 by Antoniadi with an 84-centimetre (33\u00a0in) telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no *canali* were seen.[234]\n\n\n\n### Robotic exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Self-portrait of *Perseverance* rover and *Ingenuity* helicopter (left) at Wright Brothers Field, 2021\nDozens of crewless spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been sent to Mars by the Soviet Union, the United States, Europe, India, the United Arab Emirates, and China to study the planet's surface, climate, and geology.[235] NASA's *Mariner 4* was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; launched on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. *Mariner 4* detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images of another planet from deep space.[236]\n\n\nOnce spacecraft visited the planet during NASA's Mariner missions in the 1960s and 1970s, many previous concepts of Mars were radically broken. After the results of the *Viking* life-detection experiments, the hypothesis of a dead planet was generally accepted.[237] The data from *Mariner 9* and *Viking* allowed better maps of Mars to be made, and the *Mars Global Surveyor* mission, which launched in 1996 and operated until late 2006, produced complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals.[238] These maps are available online at websites including Google Mars. Both the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* and *Mars Express* continued exploring with new instruments and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with *Curiosity*.[239][240]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Mars is host to thirteen functioning spacecraft. Eight are in orbit*: 2001 Mars Odyssey*, *Mars Express*, *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter*, *MAVEN*, *ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter*, the *Hope* orbiter, and the *Tianwen-1* orbiter.[241][242] Another five are on the surface: the Mars Science Laboratory *Curiosity* rover, the *Perseverance* rover, the *Ingenuity* helicopter, the *Tianwen-1* lander, and the *Zhurong* rover.[243]\n\n\nPlanned missions to Mars include the *Rosalind Franklin* rover mission, designed to search for evidence of past life, which was intended to be launched in 2018 but has been repeatedly delayed, with a launch date pushed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more likely one sometime in 2028.[244][245][246] A current concept for a joint NASA-ESA mission to return samples from Mars would launch in 2026.[247][248]\n\n\n\n![Map of Mars](image)Interactive image map of the global topography of Mars, overlaid with the position of Martian rovers and landers.

W. Campbell at Lick Observatory observed the planet and found that \"if water vapor or oxygen occur in the atmosphere of Mars it is in quantities too small to be detected by spectroscopes then available\".[249] That observation contradicted many of the measurements of the time and was not widely accepted.[249] Campbell and V. M. Slipher repeated the study in 1909 using better instruments, but with the same results. It was not until the findings were confirmed by W. S. Adams in 1925 that the myth of the Earth-like habitability of Mars was finally broken.[249] However, even in the 1960s, articles were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem were being published as late as 1962.[250]\n\n\nThe current understanding of planetary habitability\u00a0\u2013 the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life\u00a0\u2013 favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun is estimated to extend from within the orbit of Earth to about that of Mars.[251] During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.[252]\n\n\nThe environmental conditions on Mars are a challenge to sustaining organic life: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, it has poor insulation against bombardment by the solar wind due to the absence of a magnetosphere and has insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.[253]\n\n\n\n![see caption](image)Scoop of Mars soil by *Curiosity*, October 2012\n*In situ* investigations have been performed on Mars by the *Viking* landers, *Spirit* and *Opportunity* rovers, *Phoenix* lander, and *Curiosity* rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The *Viking* probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase in CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that *Viking* may have found life.[254] Tests conducted by the *Phoenix Mars* lander have shown that the soil has an alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.[255] The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.[256]\n\n\nA 2014 analysis of Martian meteorite EETA79001 found chlorate, perchlorate, and nitrate ions in sufficiently high concentrations to suggest that they are widespread on Mars. UV and X-ray radiation would turn chlorate and perchlorate ions into other, highly reactive oxychlorines, indicating that any organic molecules would have to be buried under the surface to survive.[257]\n\n\nScientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which is thought to have originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15\u00a0million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.[258] Small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.[259][260] Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinite.[121] Impact glass, formed by the impact of meteors, which on Earth can preserve signs of life, has also been found on the surface of the impact craters on Mars.[261][262] Likewise, the glass in impact craters on Mars could have preserved signs of life, if life existed at the site.[263][264][265]\n\n\n\n### Human mission proposals[edit]\n\n\nSeveral plans for a human mission to Mars have been proposed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, but none have come to fruition. The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to study the feasibility of a crewed Mars mission in the early 2030s; the resulting report eventually concluded that this would be unfeasible.[266][267] In addition, in 2021, China was planning to send a crewed Mars mission in 2033.[268] Privately held companies such as SpaceX have also proposed plans to send humans to Mars, with the eventual goal to settle on the planet.[269] The moon Phobos has been proposed as an anchor point for a space elevator.[270]\n\n\n\n## Viewing from Earth[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astronomy on Mars\n![see caption](image)Mars seen through an 16-inch amateur telescope, at 2020 opposition\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Mars is +0.71 with a standard deviation of 1.05.[18] Because the orbit of Mars is eccentric, the magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from about \u22123.0 to \u22121.4.[271] The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.86 when the planet is near aphelion and in conjunction with the Sun.[18] At its brightest, Mars (along with Jupiter) is second only to Venus in apparent brightness.[18] Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. Mars is usually close enough for particularly good viewing once or twice at 15-year or 17-year intervals.[272] As Mars approaches opposition, it begins a period of retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping curve with respect to the background stars. This retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak apparent brightness in the middle of this interval.[273]\n\n\nThe point at which Mars's geocentric longitude is 180\u00b0 different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of its closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and 103\u00a0million\u00a0km (34 and 64\u00a0million\u00a0mi) due to the planets' elliptical orbits, which causes comparable variation in angular size.[274][275] The most recent Mars opposition occurred on 8 December 2022, at a distance of about 82\u00a0million\u00a0km (51\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[276] The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its synodic period, is 780 days; but the number of days between successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.[196]\n\n\nMars comes into opposition from Earth every 2.1 years. The planets come into opposition near Mars's perihelion in 2003, 2018 and 2035, with the 2020 and 2033 events being particularly close to perihelic opposition.[207][277] Mars made its closest approach to Earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,000 years, 55,758,006\u00a0km (0.37271925\u00a0AU; 34,646,419\u00a0mi), magnitude \u22122.88, on 27 August 2003, at 09:51:13 UTC. This occurred when Mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its perihelion, making it particularly easy to see from Earth. The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on 12 September 57,617 BC, the next time being in 2287.[278] This record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches.[196]\n\n\nOptical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190\u00a0mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.[279]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mars in culture and Mars in fiction\n\nSee also: Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Mars\n\n![](image)*The War of the Worlds* by H. G. Wells, 1897, depicts an invasion of Earth by fictional Martians.\nMars is named after the Roman god of war. This association between Mars and war dates back at least to Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of war and destruction.[280][281] It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, whose famous first movement labels Mars \"the bringer of war\".[282] The planet's symbol, a circle with a spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender.[283] The symbol dates from at least the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.[284]\n\n\nThe idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians became widespread in the late 19th century. Schiaparelli's \"canali\" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works.[285] Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed \"Mars Fever\".[286] High-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars revealed no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still continues. Reminiscent of the *canali* observations, these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as \"pyramids\" and the \"Face on Mars\".[287] In his book *Cosmos*, planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: \"Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.\"[229]\n\n\nThe depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life.[288] This gave way to many science fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells's *The War of the Worlds*, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth; Ray Bradbury's *The Martian Chronicles*, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization; as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs's series *Barsoom*, C. S. Lewiss novel *Out of the Silent Planet* (1938),[289] and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.[290] Since then, depictions of Martians have also extended to animation. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin the Martian, appeared in *Haredevil Hare* (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.[291] After the *Mariner* and *Viking* spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as a lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars were abandoned; for many science-fiction authors, the new discoveries initially seemed like a constraint, but eventually the post-*Viking* knowledge of Mars became itself a source of inspiration for works like Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars* trilogy.[292]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Overview of and topical guide to Mars\n* List of missions to Mars\n* Magnetic field of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Past magnetic field of the planet Mars\n* Mineralogy of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Overview of the mineralogy of Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** The light filters are 635 nm, 546 nm, and 437 nm, which corresponds to red, green and blue\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c***  Best-fit ellipsoid\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Simon, J.L.; Bretagnon, P.; Chapront, J.; Chapront-Touz\u00e9, M.; Francou, G.; Laskar, J.

It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20\u00a0AU (778.5\u00a0Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86\u00a0years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\n\n\nJupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to comprise an outer mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.\n\n\nJupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\n\n\nSince 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\nIn both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine pantheon: Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the Romans.[17] The International Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976, and has since named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers, favourites, and descendants.[18] The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ![\u2643](image), descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, \u27e8\u01b5\u27e9, as an abbreviation for *Zeus*.[19][20]\n\n\nIn Latin, *Iovis* is the genitive case of *Iuppiter*, i.e. Jupiter. It is associated with the etymology of *Zeus* ('sky father'). The English equivalent, *Jove*, is only known to have come into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[21]\n\n\n*Jovian* is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form *jovial*, employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean 'happy' or 'merry', moods ascribed to Jupiter's influence in astrology.[22]\n\n\nThe original Greek deity *Zeus* supplies the root *zeno-*, which is used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as *zenographic*.[c]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand tack hypothesis\n See also: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nJupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System.[23] Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line: a distance from the early Sun where the temperature was sufficiently cold for volatiles such as water to condense into solids.[24] The planet began as a solid core, which then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the planet must have formed before the solar nebula was fully dispersed.[25] During its formation, Jupiter's mass gradually increased until it had 20 times the mass of the Earth, approximately half of which was made up of silicates, ices and other heavy-element constituents.[23] When the proto-Jupiter grew larger than 50 Earth masses it created a gap in the solar nebula.[23] Thereafter, the growing planet reached its final mass in 3\u20134 million years.[23]\n\n\nAccording to the \"grand tack hypothesis\", Jupiter began to form at a distance of roughly 3.5\u00a0AU (520\u00a0million\u00a0km; 330\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward.[24][26] This upset the orbits of several super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively.[27] Saturn would later have begun to migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, until the two planets became captured in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5\u00a0AU (220\u00a0million\u00a0km; 140\u00a0million\u00a0mi) from the Sun.[28] This changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system to their current locations.[27] All of this happened over a period of 3\u20136 million years, with the final migration of Jupiter occurring over several hundred thousand years.[26][29] Jupiter's migration from the inner solar system eventually allowed the inner planets\u2014including Earth\u2014to form from the rubble.[30]\n\n\nThere are several unresolved issues with the grand tack hypothesis. The resulting formation timescales of terrestrial planets appear to be inconsistent with the measured elemental composition.[31] It is likely that Jupiter would have settled into an orbit much closer to the Sun if it had migrated through the solar nebula.[32] Some competing models of Solar System formation predict the formation of Jupiter with orbital properties that are close to those of the present day planet.[25] Other models predict Jupiter forming at distances much farther out, such as 18\u00a0AU (2.7\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 1.7\u00a0billion\u00a0mi).[33][34]\n\n\nAccording to the Nice model, infall of proto-Kuiper belt objects over the first 600 million years of Solar System history caused Jupiter and Saturn to migrate from their initial positions into a 1:2 resonance, which caused Saturn to shift into a higher orbit, disrupting the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, depleting the Kuiper belt, and triggering the Late Heavy Bombardment.[35]\n\n\nBased on Jupiter's composition, researchers have made the case for an initial formation outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20\u201330\u00a0AU (3.0\u20134.5\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 1.9\u20132.8\u00a0billion\u00a0mi) from the Sun, and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40\u00a0AU (6.0\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 3.7\u00a0billion\u00a0mi).[36][37] Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have, over a roughly 700,000-year period, migrated inwards to its current location.[33][34] during an epoch approximately 2\u20133\u00a0million years after the planet began to form. In this model, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.[33]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nJupiter is a gas giant, being primarily composed of gas and liquid rather than solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 142,984\u00a0km (88,846\u00a0mi) at its equator, giving it a volume 1,321 times that of the Earth.[2][38] Its average density, 1.326\u00a0g/cm3, [d] is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\nBy mass, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 76% hydrogen and 24% helium, though, because helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume.[42] The atmosphere also contains trace amounts of methane, water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds as well as fractional amounts of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur.[43] The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia.[44] Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found.[45] The interior of Jupiter contains denser materials\u2014by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.[46][47]\n\n\nThe atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula.[48] Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.[49] Jupiter's helium abundance is about 80% that of the Sun due to precipitation of these elements as helium-rich droplets, a process that happens deep in the planet's interior.[50][51]\n\n\nBased on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more of the next most common elements, including oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.[52] Those planets are known as ice giants, because the majority of their volatile compounds are in solid form.[53]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jupiter mass\n\n![see caption](image)Jupiter with its moon Europa on the left. Earth's diameter is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and 4 times larger than Europa.\nJupiter's mass is 318 times that of Earth;[2] 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is so massive that its barycentre with the Sun lies above the Sun's surface at 1.068\u00a0solar radii from the Sun's centre.[54] [55]:\u200a6 Jupiter's radius is about one tenth the radius of the Sun,[56] and its mass is one thousandth the mass of the Sun, as the densities of the two bodies are similar.[57] A \"Jupiter mass\" (MJ or MJup) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects, particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. For example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69\u00a0MJ, while the brown dwarf Gliese 229 b has a mass of 60.4\u00a0MJ.[58][59]\n\n\nTheoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had over 40% more mass, the interior would be so compressed that its volume would *decrease* despite the increasing amount of matter. For smaller changes in its mass, the radius would not change appreciably.[60] As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve.[61] The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved.[62] Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times more massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star,[63] its diameter is sufficient as the smallest red dwarf may be only slightly larger in radius than Saturn.[64]\n\n\nJupiter radiates more heat than it receives through solar radiation, due to the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism within its contracting interior.[65]:\u200a30[66] This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 1\u00a0mm (0.039\u00a0in)/yr.[67][68] At the time of its formation, Jupiter was hotter and was about twice its current diameter.[69]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Jupiter, its interior, surface features, rings, and inner moons.\nBefore the early 21st century, most scientists proposed one of two scenarios for the formation of Jupiter. If the planet accreted first as a solid body, it would consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet,[70] and an outer atmosphere consisting primarily of molecular hydrogen.[68] Alternatively, if the planet collapsed directly from the gaseous protoplanetary disk, it was expected to completely lack a core, consisting instead of a denser and denser fluid (predominantly molecular and metallic hydrogen) all the way to the centre. Data from the *Juno* mission showed that Jupiter has a diffuse core that mixes into its mantle, extending for 30\u201350% of the planet's radius, and comprising heavy elements with a combined mass 7\u201325 times the Earth.[71][72][73][74][75] This mixing process could have arisen during formation, while the planet accreted solids and gases from the surrounding nebula.[76] Alternatively, it could have been caused by an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.[77][78]\n\n\nOutside the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above molecular hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.3 MPa and critical temperature of 33\u00a0K (\u2212240.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212400.3\u00a0\u00b0F).[79] In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases\u2014hydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state. The hydrogen and helium gas extending downward from the cloud layer gradually transitions to a liquid in deeper layers, possibly resembling something akin to an ocean of liquid hydrogen and other supercritical fluids.[65]:\u200a22[80][81][82] Physically, the gas gradually becomes hotter and denser as depth increases.[83][84]\n\n\nRain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through the lower atmosphere, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere.[50][85] Calculations suggest that helium drops separate from metallic hydrogen at a radius of 60,000\u00a0km (37,000\u00a0mi) (11,000\u00a0km (6,800\u00a0mi) below the cloud tops) and merge again at 50,000\u00a0km (31,000\u00a0mi) (22,000\u00a0km (14,000\u00a0mi) beneath the clouds).[86] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur, as well as on Saturn[87] and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[88]\n\n\nThe temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily inward as the heat of planetary formation can only escape by convection.[51] At a surface depth where the atmospheric pressure level is 1\u00a0bar (0.10\u00a0MPa), the temperature is around 165\u00a0K (\u2212108\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212163\u00a0\u00b0F). The region where supercritical hydrogen changes gradually from a molecular fluid to a metallic fluid spans pressure ranges of 50\u2013400\u00a0GPa with temperatures of 5,000\u20138,400\u00a0K (4,730\u20138,130\u00a0\u00b0C; 8,540\u201314,660\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively. The temperature of Jupiter's diluted core is estimated to be 20,000\u00a0K (19,700\u00a0\u00b0C; 35,500\u00a0\u00b0F) with a pressure of around 4,000\u00a0GPa.[89]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Jupiter\n\n![](image)Timelapse of Jupiter's cloud system moving over the course of one month (photographed during Voyager 1 flyby in 1979)\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter extends to a depth of 3,000\u00a0km (2,000\u00a0mi) below the cloud layers.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Cloud layers[edit]\n\n\nJupiter is perpetually covered with clouds of ammonia crystals, which may contain ammonium hydrosulfide as well.[90] The clouds are located in the tropopause layer of the atmosphere, forming bands at different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are subdivided into lighter-hued *zones* and darker *belts*. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100 metres per second (360\u00a0km/h; 220\u00a0mph) are common in zonal jet streams.[91] The zones have been observed to vary in width, colour and intensity from year to year, but they have remained stable enough for scientists to name them.[55]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of Jupiter's south pole\n![](image)\nEnhanced colour view of Jupiter's southern storms\n\nThe cloud layer is about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) deep, and consists of at least two decks of ammonia clouds: a thin clearer region on top with a thick lower deck. There may be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia clouds, as suggested by flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter.[92] These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on Earth.[93] The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the interior.[94] The Juno mission revealed the presence of \"shallow lightning\" which originates from ammonia-water clouds relatively high in the atmosphere.[95] These discharges carry \"mushballs\" of water-ammonia slushes covered in ice, which fall deep into the atmosphere.[96] Upper-atmospheric lightning has been observed in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, bright flashes of light that last around 1.4 milliseconds. These are known as \"elves\" or \"sprites\" and appear blue or pink due to the hydrogen.[97][98]\n\n\nThe orange and brown colours in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change colour when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be made up of phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.[65]:\u200a39[99] These colourful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer clouds of the lower deck. The light-coloured zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallising ammonia that hides the chromophores from view.[100]\n\n\nJupiter has a low axial tilt, thus making it that the poles always receive less solar radiation than the planet's equatorial region. Convection within the interior of the planet transports energy to the poles, balancing out temperatures at the cloud layer.[55]:\u200a54\n\n\n\n#### Great Red Spot and other vortices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Close-up of the Great Red Spot imaged by the *Juno* spacecraft in April 2018\nA well-known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot,[101] a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22\u00b0 south of the equator. It was first observed in 1831,[102] and possibly as early as 1665.[103][104] Images by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown two more \"red spots\" adjacent to the Great Red Spot.[105][106] The storm is visible through Earth-based telescopes with an aperture of 12\u00a0cm or larger.[107] The oval object rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about six days.[108] The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) above the surrounding cloud tops.[109] The Spot's composition and the source of its red colour remain uncertain, although photodissociated ammonia reacting with acetylene is a likely explanation.[110]\n\n\nThe Great Red Spot is larger than the Earth.[111] Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and will be a permanent feature of the planet.[112] However, it has significantly decreased in size since its discovery. Initial observations in the late 1800s showed it to be approximately 41,000\u00a0km (25,500\u00a0mi) across. By the time of the *Voyager* flybys in 1979, the storm had a length of 23,300\u00a0km (14,500\u00a0mi) and a width of approximately 13,000\u00a0km (8,000\u00a0mi).[113] *Hubble* observations in 1995 showed it had decreased in size to 20,950\u00a0km (13,020\u00a0mi), and observations in 2009 showed the size to be 17,910\u00a0km (11,130\u00a0mi). As of 2015[update], the storm was measured at approximately 16,500 by 10,940\u00a0km (10,250 by 6,800\u00a0mi),[113] and was decreasing in length by about 930\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi) per year.[111][114] In October 2021, a *Juno* flyby mission measured the depth of the Great Red Spot, putting it at around 300\u2013500 kilometres (190\u2013310\u00a0mi).[115]\n\n\n*Juno* missions show that there are several polar cyclone groups at Jupiter's poles. The northern group contains nine cyclones, with a large one in the centre and eight others around it, while its southern counterpart also consists of a centre vortex but is surrounded by five large storms and a single smaller one for a total of 7 storms.[116][117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Formation of Oval BA from three white ovals\nIn 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature\u2014these three smaller white ovals were formed in 1939\u20131940. The merged feature was named Oval BA. It has since increased in intensity and changed from white to red, earning it the nickname \"Little Red Spot\".[118][119]\n\n\nIn April 2017, a \"Great Cold Spot\" was discovered in Jupiter's thermosphere at its north pole. This feature is 24,000\u00a0km (15,000\u00a0mi) across, 12,000\u00a0km (7,500\u00a0mi) wide, and 200\u00a0\u00b0C (360\u00a0\u00b0F) cooler than surrounding material. While this spot changes form and intensity over the short term, it has maintained its general position in the atmosphere for more than 15 years. It may be a giant vortex similar to the Great Red Spot, and appears to be quasi-stable like the vortices in Earth's thermosphere. This feature may be formed by interactions between charged particles generated from Io and the strong magnetic field of Jupiter, resulting in a redistribution of heat flow.[120]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Magnetosphere of Jupiter\n\n![](image)\nAurorae on the north and south poles  \n(animation)\n![](image)\nAurorae on the north pole  \n(Hubble)\n![](image)\nInfrared view of southern lights  \n(Jovian IR Mapper)\n\nJupiter's magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in the Solar System,[100] with a dipole moment of 4.170 gauss (0.4170\u00a0mT) that is tilted at an angle of 10.31\u00b0 to the pole of rotation. The surface magnetic field strength varies from 2 gauss (0.20\u00a0mT) up to 20 gauss (2.0\u00a0mT).[121] This field is thought to be generated by eddy currents\u2014swirling movements of conducting materials\u2014within the liquid, metallic hydrogen core. At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath\u2014a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from solar wind.[65]:\u200a69\n\n\nThe volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide, forming a gas torus along its orbit. The gas is ionized in Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet, causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of a magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature, with short, superimposed bursts in the range of 0.6\u201330\u00a0MHz that are detectable from Earth with consumer-grade shortwave radio receivers.[122][123] As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfv\u00e9n waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the radio output of the Sun.[124]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Jupiter\n\nJupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.[125] These rings appear to be made of dust, whereas Saturn's rings are made of ice.[65]:\u200a65 The main ring is most likely made out of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis, which is drawn into Jupiter because of the planet's strong gravitational influence. New material is added by additional impacts.[126] In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea are believed to produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring.[126] There is evidence of a fourth ring that may consist of collisional debris from Amalthea that is strung along the same moon's orbit.[127]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![see caption](image)Orbit of Jupiter and other outer Solar System planets\nJupiter is the only planet whose barycentre with the Sun lies outside the volume of the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius.[128][129] The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778\u00a0million\u00a0km (5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86\u00a0years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance.[130] The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30\u00b0 compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.049, Jupiter is slightly over 75\u00a0million\u00a0km nearer the Sun at perihelion than aphelion,[2] which means that its orbit is nearly circular. This low eccentricity is at odds with exoplanet discoveries, which have revealed Jupiter-sized planets with very high eccentricities. Models suggest this may be due to there being only two giant planets in our Solar System, as the presence of a third or more giant planets tends to induce larger eccentricities.[131]\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small, only 3.13\u00b0, so its seasons are insignificant compared to those of Earth and Mars.[132]\n\n\nJupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an amateur telescope. Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5\u00a0minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere.[133] The planet is an oblate spheroid, meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles.[84] On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is 9,276\u00a0km (5,764\u00a0mi) longer than the polar diameter.[2]\n\n\nThree systems are used as frames of reference for tracking planetary rotation, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies to latitudes from 7\u00b0\u00a0N to 7\u00b0\u00a0S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50\u00a0m 30.0s. System II applies at latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55\u00a0m 40.6s.[134] System III was defined by radio astronomers and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.[135]\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![see caption](image)Jupiter and four Galilean moons seen through an amateur telescope\nJupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon, and Venus),[100] although at opposition Mars can appear brighter than Jupiter. Depending on Jupiter's position with respect to the Earth, it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as \u22122.94 at opposition down to \u22121.66 during conjunction with the Sun.[14] The mean apparent magnitude is \u22122.20 with a standard deviation of 0.33.[14] The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 30.5 arc seconds.[2] Favourable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through the perihelion of its orbit, bringing it closer to Earth.[136] Near opposition, Jupiter will appear to go into retrograde motion for a period of about 121 days, moving backward through an angle of 9.9\u00b0 before returning to prograde movement.[137]\n\n\nBecause the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth is always less than 11.5\u00b0; thus, Jupiter always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained.[138] A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A larger telescope with an aperture of 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315\u00a0cm) will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.[139][140]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-telescopic research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model in the *Almagest* of the longitudinal motion of Jupiter (\u2609) relative to Earth (\ud83d\udf28)\nObservation of Jupiter dates back to at least the Babylonian astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC.[141] The ancient Chinese knew Jupiter as the \"*Su\u00ec* Star\" (*Su\u00ecx\u012bng* \u6b72\u661f) and established their cycle of 12 earthly branches based on the approximate number of years it takes Jupiter to rotate around the Sun; the Chinese language still uses its name (simplified as \u6b72) when referring to years of age. By the 4th century BC, these observations had developed into the Chinese zodiac,[142] and each year became associated with a Tai Sui star and god controlling the region of the heavens opposite Jupiter's position in the night sky. These beliefs survive in some Taoist religious practices and in the East Asian zodiac's twelve animals. The Chinese historian Xi Zezong has claimed that Gan De, an ancient Chinese astronomer,[143] reported a small star \"in alliance\" with the planet,[144] which may indicate a sighting of one of Jupiter's moons with the unaided eye. If true, this would predate Galileo's discovery by nearly two millennia.[145][146]\n\n\nA 2016 paper reports that trapezoidal rule was used by Babylonians before 50 BCE for integrating the velocity of Jupiter along the ecliptic.[147] In his 2nd century work the *Almagest*, the Hellenistic astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus constructed a geocentric planetary model based on deferents and epicycles to explain Jupiter's motion relative to Earth, giving its orbital period around Earth as 4332.38\u00a0days, or 11.86\u00a0years.[148]\n\n\n\n### Ground-based telescope research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo's drawings of Jupiter and its \"Medicean Stars\" from *Sidereus Nuncius*\nIn 1610, Italian polymath Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons) using a telescope. This is thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. Just one day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614.[149] It was Marius's names for the major moons, however, that stuck: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The discovery was a major point in favour of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory led to him being tried and condemned by the Inquisition.[150]\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1639, the Neapolitan optician Francesco Fontana tested a 22-palm telescope of his own making and discovered the characteristic bands of the planet's atmosphere.[151]\n\n\nDuring the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new telescope to discover spots in Jupiter's atmosphere, observe that the planet appeared oblate, and estimate its rotation period.[152] In 1692, Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes a differential rotation.[153]\n\n\nThe Great Red Spot may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.[154] The Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878.[155] It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century.[156]\n\n\nBoth Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of Jupiter's moons, which allowed predictions of when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, Cassini observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17\u00a0minutes later than expected. Ole R\u00f8mer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected),[47] and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.[157][158]\n\n\nIn 1892, E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch (910\u00a0mm) refractor at Lick Observatory in California. This moon was later named Amalthea.[159] It was the last planetary moon to be discovered directly by a visual observer through a telescope.[160] An additional eight satellites were discovered before the flyby of the Voyager 1 probe in 1979.[e]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jupiter viewed in infrared by JWST  \n(July 14, 2022)\nIn 1932, Rupert Wildt identified absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of Jupiter.[161] Three long-lived anticyclonic features called \"white ovals\" were observed in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.[162]\n\n\n\n### Radiotelescope research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Image of Jupiter and its radiation belts in radio\nIn 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin discovered that Jupiter emits bursts of radio waves at a frequency of 22.2\u00a0MHz.[65]:\u200a36 The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they used this information to determine a more precise value for Jupiter's rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) lasting less than a hundredth of a second.[163]\n\n\nScientists have discovered three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter:\n\n\n\n* Decametric radio bursts (with a wavelength of tens of metres) vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are influenced by the interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.[164]\n* Decimetric radio emission (with wavelengths measured in centimetres) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959.[65]:\u200a36 The origin of this signal is a torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator, which generates cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.[165]\n* Thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere of Jupiter.[65]:\u200a43\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Jupiter\n\nJupiter has been visited by automated spacecraft since 1973, when the space probe *Pioneer 10* passed close enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about its properties and phenomena.[166][167] Missions to Jupiter are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Entering a Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter from low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of 6.3\u00a0km/s,[168] which is comparable to the 9.7\u00a0km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[169] Gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Flyby missions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spacecraft\n | Closest approach\n | Distance (km)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *Pioneer 10* | December 3, 1973\n | 130,000\n |\n| *Pioneer 11* | December 4, 1974\n | 34,000\n |\n| *Voyager 1* | March 5, 1979\n | 349,000\n |\n| *Voyager 2* | July 9, 1979\n | 570,000\n |\n| *Ulysses* | February 8, 1992[171] | 408,894\n |\n| February 4, 2004[171] | 120,000,000\n |\n| *Cassini* | December 30, 2000\n | 10,000,000\n |\n| *New Horizons* | February 28, 2007\n | 2,304,535\n |\n\n\nBeginning in 1973, several spacecraft performed planetary flyby manoeuvres that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter and the amount of polar flattening.[55]:\u200a47[172]\n\n\nSix years later, the Voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Spot had changed hues since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, which were found to come from erupting volcanoes on the moon's surface. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.[55]:\u200a87[173]\n\n\nThe next mission to encounter Jupiter was the *Ulysses* solar probe. In February 1992, it performed a flyby manoeuvre to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft studied Jupiter's magnetosphere, although it had no cameras to photograph the planet. The spacecraft passed by Jupiter six years later, this time at a much greater distance.[171]\n\n\nIn 2000, the *Cassini* probe flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn, and provided higher-resolution images.[174]\n\n\nThe *New Horizons* probe flew by Jupiter in 2007 for a gravity assist en route to Pluto.[175] The probe's cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail.[176]\n\n\n\n#### *Galileo* mission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Galileo (spacecraft)\n\n![](image)*Galileo* in preparation for mating with the rocket, 1989\nThe first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the *Galileo* mission, which reached the planet on December 7, 1995.[61] It remained in orbit for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 when it collided with Jupiter in 1994. Some of the goals for the mission were thwarted due to a malfunction in *Galileo'*s high-gain antenna.[177]\n\n\nA 340-kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.[61] It parachuted through 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) of the atmosphere at a speed of about 2,575\u00a0km/h (1600\u00a0mph)[61] and collected data for 57.6\u00a0minutes until the spacecraft was destroyed.[178] The *Galileo* orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003. NASA destroyed the spacecraft to avoid any possibility of the spacecraft crashing into and possibly contaminating the moon Europa, which may harbour life.[177]\n\n\nData from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90% of Jupiter's atmosphere.[61] The recorded temperature was more than 300\u00a0\u00b0C (570\u00a0\u00b0F) and the windspeed measured more than 644\u00a0km/h (>400\u00a0mph) before the probes vaporized.[61]\n\n\n\n#### *Juno* mission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Juno (spacecraft)\n\n![see caption](image)*Juno* preparing for testing in a rotation stand, 2011\nNASA's *Juno* mission arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016 with the goal of studying the planet in detail from a polar orbit. The spacecraft was originally intended to orbit Jupiter thirty-seven times over a period of twenty months.[179][73][180] During the mission, the spacecraft will be exposed to high levels of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere, which may cause future failure of certain instruments.[181] On August 27, 2016, the spacecraft completed its first fly-by of Jupiter and sent back the first-ever images of Jupiter's north pole.[182]\n\n\n*Juno* completed 12 orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.[183] In June of that year, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021, and in January of that year the mission was extended to September 2025 with four lunar flybys: one of Ganymede, one of Europa, and two of Io.[184][185] When *Juno* reaches the end of the mission, it will perform a controlled deorbit and disintegrate into Jupiter's atmosphere. This will avoid the risk of collision with Jupiter's moons.[186][187]\n\n\n\n#### Cancelled missions and future plans[edit]\n\n\nThere is great interest in missions to study Jupiter's larger icy moons, which may have subsurface liquid oceans.[188] Funding difficulties have delayed progress, causing NASA's *JIMO* (*Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter*) to be cancelled in 2005.[189] A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA/ESA mission called EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter.[190] However, the ESA formally ended the partnership in April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection.[191] These plans have been realized as the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), launched on April 14, 2023,[192] followed by NASA's *Europa Clipper* mission, scheduled for launch in 2024.[193]\n\n\n\nViews of Jupiter from JunoCam\nOther proposed missions include the Chinese National Space Administration's *Tianwen-4* mission which aims to launch an orbiter to the Jovian system and possibly Callisto around 2035,[194] and CNSA's *Interstellar Express*[195] and NASA's *Interstellar Probe*,[196] which would both use Jupiter's gravity to help them reach the edges of the heliosphere.\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Jupiter\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons and Satellite system (astronomy)\n\nJupiter has 95 known natural satellites,[7] and it is likely that this number would go up in the future due to improved instrumentation.[197] Of these, 79 are less than 10\u00a0km in diameter.[7] The four largest moons are Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa (in order of decreasing size), collectively known as the \"Galilean moons\", and are visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night.[198]\n\n\n\n### Galilean moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Galilean moons\n\nThe moons discovered by Galileo\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto\u2014are among the largest in the Solar System. The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbours at the same point in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.[199]\n\n\nThe eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. The friction created by this tidal flexing generates heat in the interior of the moons.[200] This is seen most dramatically in the volcanic activity of Io (which is subject to the strongest tidal forces),[200] and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface, which indicates recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior.[201]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nThe Galilean moons compared to the Earth's Moon\n| Name\n | IPA | Diameter\n | Mass\n | Orbital radius\n | Orbital period\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| km\n | *D*\u263e | kg\n | *M*\u263e | km\n | *a*\u263e | days\n | *T*\u263e |\n| Io | /\u02c8a\u026a.o\u028a/ | 3,643\n | 1.05\n | 8.9\u00d71022 | 1.20\n | 421,700\n | 1.10\n | 1.77\n | 0.07\n |\n| Europa | /j\u028a\u02c8ro\u028ap\u0259/ | 3,122\n | 0.90\n | 4.8\u00d71022 | 0.65\n | 671,034\n | 1.75\n | 3.55\n | 0.13\n |\n| Ganymede | /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6nimi\u02d0d/ | 5,262\n | 1.50\n | 14.8\u00d71022 | 2.00\n | 1,070,412\n | 2.80\n | 7.15\n | 0.26\n |\n| Callisto | /k\u0259\u02c8l\u026asto\u028a/ | 4,821\n | 1.40\n | 10.8\u00d71022 | 1.50\n | 1,882,709\n | 4.90\n | 16.69\n | 0.61\n |\n\n |\n| ![The Galilean moons.

From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto. |\n| The Galilean moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto (in order of increasing distance from Jupiter)\n |\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\nJupiter's moons were traditionally classified into four groups of four, based on their similar orbital elements.[202] This picture has been complicated by the discovery of numerous small outer moons since 1999. Jupiter's moons are currently divided into several different groups, although there are several moons which are not part of any group.[203]\n\n\nThe eight innermost regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator, are thought to have formed alongside Jupiter, whilst the remainder are irregular moons and are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. The irregular moons within each group may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.[204][205]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Regular moons\n |\n| --- |\n| Inner group | The inner group of four small moons all have diameters of less than 200\u00a0km, orbit at radii less than 200,000\u00a0km, and have orbital inclinations of less than half a degree.[206] |\n| Galilean\u00a0moons[207] | These four moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei and by Simon Marius in parallel, orbit between 400,000 and 2,000,000\u00a0km, and are some of the largest moons in the Solar System.\n |\n| Irregular moons\n |\n| Himalia group | A tightly clustered group of prograde-orbiting moons with orbits around 11,000,000\u201312,000,000\u00a0km from Jupiter.[208] |\n| Carpo group | A sparsely populated group of small moons with highly inclined prograde orbits around 16,000,000\u201317,000,000\u00a0km from Jupiter.[7] |\n| Ananke\u00a0group | This group of retrograde-orbiting moons has rather indistinct borders, averaging 21,276,000\u00a0km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 149 degrees.[205] |\n| Carme group | A tightly clustered group of retrograde-orbiting moons that averages 23,404,000\u00a0km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 165 degrees.[205] |\n| Pasiphae group | A dispersed and only vaguely distinct retrograde group that covers all the outermost moons.[209] |\n\n\n## Interaction with the Solar System[edit]\n\n\nAs the most massive of the eight planets, the gravitational influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. With the exception of Mercury, the orbits of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane. The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter,[210] and the planet may have been responsible for the purported Late Heavy Bombardment in the inner Solar System's history.[211]\n\n\nIn addition to its moons, Jupiter's gravitational field controls numerous asteroids that have settled around the Lagrangian points that precede and follow the planet in its orbit around the Sun. These are known as the Trojan asteroids, and are divided into Greek and Trojan \"camps\" to honour the *Iliad*. The first of these, 588 Achilles, was discovered by Max Wolf in 1906; since then more than two thousand have been discovered.[212] The largest is 624 Hektor.[213]\n\n\nThe Jupiter family is defined as comets that have a semi-major axis smaller than Jupiter's; most short-period comets belong to this group. Members of the Jupiter family are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close encounters with Jupiter, they are perturbed into orbits with a smaller period, which then becomes circularized by regular gravitational interactions with the Sun and Jupiter.[214]\n\n\n\n### Impacts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Impact events on Jupiter\n\n![](image)Brown spots mark Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9's impact sites on Jupiter\nJupiter has been called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner[215] because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner Solar System. There are more impacts on Jupiter, such as comets, than on any other planet in the Solar System.[216] For example, Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.[61] In the past, scientists believed that Jupiter partially shielded the inner system from cometary bombardment.[61] However, computer simulations in 2008 suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them.[217] This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt, while others believe that Jupiter protects Earth from the Oort cloud.[218]\n\n\nIn July 1994, the Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 comet collided with Jupiter.[219][220] The impacts were closely observed by observatories around the world, including the Hubble Space Telescope and *Galileo* spacecraft.[221][222][223][224] The event was widely covered by the media.[225]\n\n\nSurveys of early astronomical records and drawings produced eight examples of potential impact observations between 1664 and 1839. However, a 1997 review determined that these observations had little or no possibility of being the results of impacts. Further investigation by this team revealed a dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 may have been an impact scar.[226]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jupiter in fiction and Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Jupiter\n\n![](image)Jupiter, woodcut from a 1550 edition of Guido Bonatti's *Liber Astronomiae*\nThe existence of the planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low.[227] To the Babylonians, this planet represented their god Marduk,[228] chief of their pantheon from the Hammurabi period.[229] They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.[228]\n\n\nThe mythical Greek name for this planet is *Zeus* (\u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), also referred to as *Dias* (\u0394\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek.[230] The ancient Greeks knew the planet as Phaethon (\u03a6\u03b1\u03ad\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd), meaning \"shining one\" or \"blazing star\".[231][232] The Greek myths of Zeus from the Homeric period showed particular similarities to certain Near-Eastern gods, including the Semitic El and Baal, the Sumerian Enlil, and the Babylonian god Marduk.[233] The association between the planet and the Greek deity Zeus was drawn from Near Eastern influences and was fully established by the fourth century BCE, as documented in the *Epinomis* of Plato and his contemporaries.[234]\n\n\nThe god Jupiter is the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and he is the principal god of Roman mythology. The Romans originally called Jupiter the \"star of Jupiter\" (*Iuppiter Stella*), as they believed it to be sacred to its namesake god. This name comes from the Proto-Indo-European vocative compound \\**Dy\u0113u-p\u0259ter* (nominative: \\**Dy\u0113us-p\u0259t\u0113r*, meaning \"Father Sky-God\", or \"Father Day-God\").[235] As the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter was the god of thunder, lightning, and storms, and was appropriately called the god of light and sky.[236]\n\n\nIn Vedic astrology, Hindu astrologers named the planet after Brihaspati, the religious teacher of the gods, and often called it \"Guru\", which means the \"Teacher\".[237][238] In Central Asian Turkic myths, Jupiter is called *Erendiz* or *Erent\u00fcz*, from *eren* (of uncertain meaning) and *yultuz* (\"star\"). The Turks calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days. They believed that some social and natural events connected to Erent\u00fcz's movements on the sky.[239] The Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese called it the \"wood star\" (Chinese: \u6728\u661f; pinyin: *m\u00f9x\u012bng*), based on the Chinese Five Elements.[240][241][242] In China it became known as the \"Year-star\" (Sui-sing) as Chinese astronomers noted that it jumped one zodiac constellation each year (with corrections). In some ancient Chinese writings the years were named, at least in principle, in correlation with the Jovian zodiac signs.[243]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Infrared view of Jupiter, imaged by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai\u02bbi, January 11, 2017](image)\n\nInfrared view of Jupiter, imaged by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai\u02bbi, January 11, 2017\n* ![Jupiter imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, January 11, 2017](image)\n\nJupiter imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, January 11, 2017\n* ![Ultraviolet view of Jupiter by Hubble, January 11, 2017[244]](image)\n\nUltraviolet view of Jupiter by Hubble, January 11, 2017[244]\n* ![Jupiter and Europa, taken by Hubble on 25 August 2020, when the planet was 653 million kilometres from Earth.[245]](image)\n\nJupiter and Europa, taken by Hubble on 25 August 2020, when the planet was 653 million kilometres from Earth.[245]\n* ![Infrared photo by James Webb Space Telescope, August 2022[246]](image)\n\nInfrared photo by James Webb Space Telescope, August 2022[246]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Overview of and topical guide to Jupiter\n* Eccentric Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Jovian planet that orbits its star in an eccentric orbit\n* Hot Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Class of high mass planets orbiting close to a star\n* Super-Jupiter\u00a0\u2013 Class of planets with more mass than Jupiter\n* Jovian\u2013Plutonian gravitational effect\u00a0\u2013 Astronomical hoax\n* List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n2. **^** Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n3. **^** See for example: \"IAUC 2844: Jupiter; 1975h\".

It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[28][29][30]\n\n\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[31] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).\n\n\nThe planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons[32] are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[33]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\nSaturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (![\u2644](image)) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho ligature with a horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for *\u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2* (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet (![](image)).[34]\nIt later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize this pagan symbol. \n\n\nThe Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, *S\u0101turni di\u0113s* (\"Saturn's Day\"), for the planet Saturn.[35]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nSaturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core.[36] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than its polar radius: 60,268\u00a0km versus 54,364\u00a0km.[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96\u00a0m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36\u00a0km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[37]\n\n\nSaturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water\u2014about 30% less.[38] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69\u00a0g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass,[39] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Saturn, to scaleDespite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01\u00a0g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.[40]\n\n\nStandard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles.[41] Analysis of the distortion shows that Saturn is substantially more centrally condensed than Jupiter and therefore contains a significantly larger amount of material denser than hydrogen near its centre. Saturn's central regions contain about 50% hydrogen by mass, while Jupiter's contain approximately 67% hydrogen.[42]\n\n\nThis core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9\u201322 times the mass of Earth,[43][44] which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000\u00a0km.[45] However, measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to about 17 Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire radius.[46] This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000\u00a0km and consists of gas.[47][48][49]\n\n\nSaturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700\u00a0\u00b0C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be the generation of heat through the \"raining out\" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.[50][51] These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[41] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter[52] and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[53]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nThe outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.[54] The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.[41] The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19\u201331 times the mass of Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.[55]\n\n\nTrace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.[56][57][58] The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water.[59] Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.[58] *Cassini* observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes, nicknamed the \"String of Pearls\". These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Cloud layers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A global storm girdles the planet in 2011. The storm passes around the planet, such that the storm's head (bright area) passes its tail.\nSaturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the *Voyager* spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.[61]\n\n\nThe composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with temperatures in the range of 100\u2013160\u00a0K and pressures extending between 0.5\u20132 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185 to 270\u00a0K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3\u20136 bar with temperatures of 190\u2013235\u00a0K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar and temperatures are 270\u2013330\u00a0K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.[62]\n\n\nSaturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the *Voyager* encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot, a short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice.[63] Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the best observed.[64] The latest giant storm was observed in 2010. In 2015, researchers used Very Large Array telescope to study Saturnian atmosphere, and reported that they found \"long-lasting signatures of all mid-latitude giant storms, a mixture of equatorial storms up to hundreds of years old, and potentially an unreported older storm at 70\u00b0N\".[65]\n\n\nThe winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. *Voyager* data indicate peak easterly winds of 500\u00a0m/s (1,800\u00a0km/h).[66] In images from the *Cassini* spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering.[67] Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System.[68] Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally \u2212185\u00a0\u00b0C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as \u2212122\u00a0\u00b0C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Hexagonal cloud patterns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saturn's hexagon\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSaturn's north and south pole in infrared\n\nA persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78\u00b0N was first noted in the *Voyager* images.[69][70][71] The sides of the hexagon are each about 14,500\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) long, which is longer than the diameter of the Earth.[72] The entire structure rotates with a period of 10h 39m 24s (the same period as that of the planet's radio emissions) which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn's interior.[73] The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere.[74] The pattern's origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.[75][76]\n\n\nHST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream, but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave.[77] NASA reported in November 2006 that *Cassini* had observed a \"hurricane-like\" storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall.[78][79] Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth. For example, images from the *Galileo* spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.[80]\n\n\nThe south pole storm may have been present for billions of years.[81] This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth, and it has winds of 550\u00a0km/h.[81]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Magnetosphere of Saturn\n\n![](image)Auroral lights at Saturn's north pole\nSaturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape\u2014a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator\u20140.2\u00a0gauss (\u00b5T)\u2014is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field.[31] As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's.[82] When *Voyager 2* entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1\u00a0million km (712,000\u00a0mi),[83] although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days.[84] Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter\u2014by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo.[82] This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere.[31] Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.[85]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Animation of Saturn and the Solar System's outer planets orbiting around the Sun\n![](image)Simulated appearance of Saturn as seen from Earth (at opposition) during an orbit of Saturn, 2001\u20132029The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4\u00a0billion kilometers (9\u00a0AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68\u00a0km/s,[6] it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about 29+1\u20442\u00a0years)[86] to finish one revolution around the Sun.[6] As a consequence, it forms a near 5:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.[87] The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48\u00b0 relative to the orbital plane of the Earth.[6] The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957\u00a0AU, on average.[6][88] The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude, and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).\n\n\nAstronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. *System\u00a0I* has a period of 10h 14m 00s (844.3\u00b0/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to *System\u00a0I*. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as *System\u00a0II* and have been assigned a rotation period of 10h 38m 25.4s (810.76\u00b0/d). *System\u00a0III* refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet detected by *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2*,[89] System\u00a0III has a rotation period of 10h 39m 22.4s (810.8\u00b0/d). System\u00a0III has largely superseded System\u00a0II.[90]\n\n\nA precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, *Cassini* found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10h 45m 45s \u00b1 36s.[91][92] An estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the *Cassini*, *Voyager* and *Pioneer* probes is 10h 32m 35s.[93] Studies of the planet's C Ring yield a rotation period of 10h 33m 38s + 1m 52s  \n\u2212 1m 19s\u2009.[17][18]\n\n\nIn March 2007, it was found that the variation in radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.[94][95][96]\n\n\nAn apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable Lagrangian points, designated L4 and L5, located at 60\u00b0 angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have been discovered for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Orbital resonance mechanisms, including secular resonance, are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.[97]\n\n\n\n## Natural satellites[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Saturn\n\n![](image)Artist conception of Saturn, its rings and major icy moons\u2014from Mimas to Rhea\nSaturn has 146 known moons, 63 of which have formal names.[12][11] It is estimated that there are other 100\u00b130 outer irregular moons larger than 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) in diameter.[98]\nIn addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40\u2013500 meters in Saturn's rings,[99] which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.[100] Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own,[101] along with a tenuous atmosphere.[102][103][104]\n\n\nMany of the other moons are small: 131 are less than 50\u00a0km in diameter.[105] Traditionally, most of Saturn's moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology. Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere,[106][107] in which a complex organic chemistry occurs. It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes.[108][109]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life.[110] On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.[111]\n\n\nSaturn's moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets,[112] has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life.[113][114][115][116] Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite's salt-rich particles having an \"ocean-like\" composition that indicates most of Enceladus's expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water.[117][118][119] A 2015 flyby by *Cassini* through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the A Ring, which was imaged by *Cassini* on 15 April 2013.[121]\n\n\n\n## Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Saturn\n\n![](image)The rings of Saturn (imaged here by *Cassini* in 2007) are the most massive and conspicuous in the Solar System.[48]\nSaturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique.[48] The rings extend from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers (4,120 to 75,000\u00a0mi) outward from Saturn's equator and average approximately 20 meters (66\u00a0ft) in thickness. They are composed predominantly of water ice, with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately 7% amorphous carbon.[122] The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10\u00a0m.[123] While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.\n\n\nThere are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn, for which a research team at MIT has proposed the name \"Chrysalis\".[124] The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn was formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.[125][126][127][128] The water abundance of the rings varies radially, with the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water. This abundance variance may be explained by meteor bombardment.[129]\n\n\nBeyond the main rings, at a distance of 12\u00a0million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring. It is tilted at an angle of 27\u00b0 to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.[130]\n\n\nSome of the moons of Saturn, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out.[131] Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.[132]\n\n\nIn September 2023, astronomers reported studies suggesting that the rings of Saturn may have resulted from the collision of two moons \"a few hundred million years ago\".[133][134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNatural-color mosaic of *Cassini* narrow-angle camera images of the unilluminated side of Saturn's D, C, B, A and F rings (left to right) taken on May 9, 2007 (distances are to the planet's center).\n\n## History of observation and exploration[edit]\n\n\nThe observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases: (1) pre-modern observations with the naked eye, (2) telescopic observations from Earth beginning in the 17th century, and (3) visitation by space probes, in orbit or on flyby. In the 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth (including Earth-orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope) and, until its 2017 retirement, from the *Cassini* orbiter around Saturn.\n\n\n\n### Pre-telescopic observation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Saturn (mythology) and Planets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Saturn\n\nSaturn has been known since prehistoric times,[135] and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn.[136] In ancient Greek, the planet was known as \u03a6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd ***Phainon***,[137] and in Roman times it was known as the \"star of Saturn\".[138] In ancient Roman mythology, the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god, from which the planet takes its modern name.[139] The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus; in modern Greek, the planet retains the name *Cronus*\u2014\u039a\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2: *Kronos*.[140]\n\n\nThe Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn's orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition.[141] In Hindu astrology, there are nine astrological objects, known as Navagrahas. Saturn is known as \"Shani\" and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life.[139][141] Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the \"earth star\" (\u571f\u661f). This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements.[142][143][144]\n\n\nIn ancient Hebrew, Saturn is called *Shabbathai*.[145] Its angel is Cassiel. Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is 'Ag\u020b\u0207l (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc, romanized:\u00a0*\u02bfAgyal*),[146] and its darker spirit (demon) is Z\u0203z\u0207l (Hebrew: \u05d6\u05d0\u05d6\u05dc, romanized:\u00a0*Zazl*).[146][147][148] Zazel has been described as a great angel, invoked in Solomonic magic, who is \"effective in love conjurations\".[149][150] In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, and Malay, the name of Zazel is 'Zuhal', derived from the Arabic language (Arabic: \u0632\u062d\u0644, romanized:\u00a0*Zuhal*).[147]\n\n\n\n### Telescopic pre-spaceflight observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei observed the rings of Saturn in 1610, but was unable to determine what they were\n![](image)Robert Hooke noted the shadows (a and b) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of Saturn in 1666.\nSaturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope[151] to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Christiaan Huygens saw them in 1655 and published about this in 1659. Galileo, with his primitive telescope in 1610,[152][153] incorrectly thought of Saturn's appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn's sides.[154][155] It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted, and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division.[156]\n\n\nNo further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when William Herschel discovered two further moons, Mimas and Enceladus. The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion, which has a resonance with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British team.[157]\n\n\nIn 1899 William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe, a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do.[157] Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it took more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere \u2013 a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.[158]\n\n\n\n### Spaceflight missions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Saturn\n\n#### *Pioneer 11* flyby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Pioneer 11* image of Saturn\n*Pioneer 11* made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000\u00a0km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at a high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, *Pioneer 11* measured the temperature of Titan.[159]\n\n\n\n#### *Voyager* flybys[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1980, the *Voyager 1* probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. *Voyager 1* performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable at visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out of the plane of the Solar System.[160]\n\n\nAlmost a year later, in August 1981, *Voyager 2* continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.[160]\n\n\nThe probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings, as well as the small Maxwell Gap (a gap within the C Ring) and Keeler gap (a 42\u00a0km-wide gap in the A Ring).\n\n\n\n#### *Cassini\u2013Huygens* spacecraft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cassini\u2013Huygens\n![](image)At Enceladus's south pole geysers spray water from many locations along the tiger stripes.[161]\nThe *Cassini\u2013Huygens* space probe entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. In June 2004, it conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. *Cassini*'s flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the *Huygens* probe on 25 December 2004. *Huygens* descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.[162]\n\n\nStarting in early 2005, scientists used *Cassini* to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately 1,000\u00a0times that of lightning on Earth.[163]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, NASA reported that *Cassini* had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus. These jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon's south polar region.[164] Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus.[161] In May 2011, NASA scientists reported that Enceladus \"is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it\".[165][166]\n\n![](image)Saturn eclipses the Sun, as seen from *Cassini*. The rings are visible, including the F Ring.\n*Cassini* photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E\u00a0rings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus.[167] In July 2006, images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, hydrocarbon seas were found near the North pole, the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea.[168] In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000\u00a0km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.[169]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2 November 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites.[170] In April 2013 *Cassini* sent back images of a hurricane at the planet's north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth, with winds faster than 530\u00a0km/h (330\u00a0mph).[171] On 15 September 2017, the *Cassini-Huygens* spacecraft performed the \"Grand Finale\" of its mission: a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[172][173] The atmospheric entry of *Cassini* ended the mission.\n\n\n\n#### Possible future missions[edit]\n\n\nThe continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included the Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe, and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus by *Dragonfly*.[174][175]\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amateur telescopic view of Saturn\nSaturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus, and occasionally 4 Vesta, are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. The mean apparent magnitude of Saturn is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.34.[23] Most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth. The brightest magnitude, \u22120.55, occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly, and the faintest magnitude, 1.17, occurs around the time when they are least inclined.[23] It takes approximately 29.4 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings in which clear resolution is present.[48][151] When Earth passes through the ring plane, which occurs twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin. Such a \"disappearance\" will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations.[176]\n\n\nSaturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, opposition, the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180\u00b0, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every year\u2014approximately every 378 days\u2014and results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits, which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next. Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible. For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth,[177] even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.[177]\n\n\nFrom time to time, Saturn is occulted by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in \"seasons\". Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a 12-month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered. The Moon's orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to Saturn's, so occultations will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points in the sky where the two planes intersect (both the length of Saturn's year and the 18.6-Earth year nodal precession period of the Moon's orbit influence the periodicity).[178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n2. **^** Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Walter, Elizabeth (21 April 2003). *Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary* (Second\u00a0ed.).

It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49\u00a0K (\u2212224\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371\u00a0\u00b0F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8\u00b0 with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. \n\n\nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900\u00a0km/h (560\u00a0mph),[22] variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \n\n\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Its ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbiting at much greater distance from Uranus are the known nine irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons.\n\n\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, it was visited up close only once when in 1986 the *Voyager\u00a02* probe flew by the planet.[23] Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023\u20132032 survey.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Position of Uranus (marked with a cross) on the date of its discovery, March 13th, 1781\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[24] Sir William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's *Almagest*.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.\n\n\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel \"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.\"[29][30]\n\n\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \"In the quartile near \u03b6 Tauri\u00a0... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\"[31] On 17 March he noted: \"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\"[32] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[29]\n\n\n\n\n> The power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\"[33]\n\n\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[34] Its nearly circular orbit led him to the conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\".[35] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet's than a comet's.[36]\n\n\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\"[37] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of \u00a3200 (equivalent to \u00a330,000 in 2023)[38] on condition that he moved to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[39]\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: \u039f\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), known as Caelus in Roman mythology, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which was rendered as *Uranus* in Latin (IPA: [\u02c8u\u02d0ran\u028as]).[2] It is the only one of the eight planets whose English name derives from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \"Uranian\".[40] The pronunciation of the name *Uranus* preferred among astronomers is /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/ *YOOR-\u0259-n\u0259s*,[1] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin *Uranus*, in contrast to /j\u028a\u02c8re\u026an\u0259s/ *yoo-RAY-n\u0259s*, with stress on the second syllable and a long *a*, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\n\n\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \"do the astronomical world the faver [*sic*] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\".[42] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object *Georgium Sidus* (George's Star), or the \"Georgian Planet\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[43] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[37]\n\n\n\n\n> In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande proposed that it be named *Herschel* in honour of its discoverer.[44] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names Astraea*,* Cybele (now the names of asteroids), and *Neptune*, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. The name was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even *Neptune George III* or *Neptune Great Britain*, a compromise Lexell suggested as well.[34][45] Daniel Bernoulli, suggested *Hypercronius* and *Transaturnis*. Georg Lichtenberg from G\u00f6ttingen suggested *Austr\u00e4a*, a goddess mentioned by Ovid (but who is traditionally associated with Virgo). The name *Minerva* was also proposed.[45]\n\n\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed *Uranus*, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[46] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[46] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[39][46][47][48] Bode was however apparently unaware that *Uranus* was only the Latinised form of the titular deity, and his Roman equivalent was Caelus. In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[49] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using *Georgium Sidus* to *Uranus*.[47]\n\n\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ![\u26e2](image),[g] was proposed by Johann Gottfried K\u00f6hler at Bode's request in 1782.[50] K\u00f6hler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no alchemical symbol for platinum, he suggested \u26e2 or \u26e2, a combination of the planetary-metal symbols \u2609 (gold) and \u2642 (iron), as platinum (or 'white gold') is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, \u26e2, fit better with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct.[50] This symbol predominates in modern astronomical use in the rare cases that symbols are used at all.[51][52] The second symbol, ![\u2645](image),[h] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"*un globe surmont\u00e9 par la premi\u00e8re lettre de votre nom*\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\").[44] The second symbol is nearly universal in astrology.\n\n\nUranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. Uranus's name is literally translated as the \"sky king star\" in Chinese (\u5929\u738b\u661f), Japanese (\u5929\u738b\u661f), Korean (\ucc9c\uc655\uc131), and Vietnamese (*sao Thi\u00ean V\u01b0\u01a1ng*).[53][54][55][56] In Thai, its official name is *Dao Yurenat* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e22\u0e39\u0e40\u0e23\u0e19\u0e31\u0e2a), as in English. Its other name in Thai is *Dao Maruettayu* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e24\u0e15\u0e22\u0e39, Star of M\u1e5btyu), after the Sanskrit word for 'death', *Mrtyu* (\u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941). In Mongolian, its name is *Tengeriin Van* (\u0422\u044d\u043d\u0433\u044d\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), translated as 'King of the Sky', reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is *Hele\u02bbekala*, the Hawaiian rendering of the name 'Herschel'.[57] In M\u0101ori, its name is *Wh\u0113rangi*.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nFor details of the evolution of Uranus's orbit, see Nice model.\n\nIt is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history.[60][61][62] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[60][61][63] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.[64] The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[60][61][65] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[60]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta Tauri twice since then, on 25\u00a0March\u00a01865 and 29\u00a0March\u00a01949. Uranus will return to this location again on 3\u00a0April\u00a02033. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20\u00a0AU (3\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 2\u00a0billion\u00a0mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[66] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[67]\n\n\nThe orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[68] With time, discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17\u00a0hours, 14\u00a0minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Simulated Earth view of Uranus from 1986 to 2030, from southern summer solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007 and northern summer solstice in 2028.\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0 (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. (Pluto and the protoplanet-asteroid 2 Pallas also have extreme axial tilts.) Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away, with only a narrow strip around the equator experiencing a rapid day\u2013night cycle, with the Sun low over the horizon. On the other side of Uranus's orbit, the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42\u00a0years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42\u00a0years of darkness.[71] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus, giving a period of day\u2013night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.\n\n\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the near-polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[72] Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4\u00a0billion years ago.[73]\nUranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of *Voyager\u00a02*'s flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \"south\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[74][75] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[76]\n\n\n\n\n\nList of solstices and equinoxes[77]\n| Northern hemisphere\n | Year\n | Southern hemisphere\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter solstice\n | 1902, 1986, 2069\n | Summer solstice\n |\n| Vernal equinox\n | 1923, 2007, 2092\n | Autumnal equinox\n |\n| Summer solstice\n | 1944, 2030\n | Winter solstice\n |\n| Autumnal equinox\n | 1965, 2050\n | Vernal equinox\n |\n\n\n### Visibility from Earth[edit]\n\n\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are 5.38 and 6.03.[18] This range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7\u00a0arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20\u00a0arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45\u00a0arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23\u00a0cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25\u00a0cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth and UranusUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27\u00a0g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3\u00a0and 13.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16][81] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7\u00a0Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[16]\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron\u2013nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[16][82] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55\u00a0Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus'; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4\u00a0Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5\u00a0Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[16][82] Uranus's core density is around 9\u00a0g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8\u00a0million\u00a0bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000\u00a0K.[81][82] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[16][82] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean.[83]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the interior of Uranus, listing each layer's composition\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[84][85] This phenomenon is similar to diamond rains that are theorised by scientists to exist on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.[86][87] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[88][89][90]\n\n\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[91]\n\n\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \"surface\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0km (15,881.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mi) and 24,973\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0km (15,518\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[22][92] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[22] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 1.06\u00b10.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[17][93] Uranus's heat flux is only 0.042\u00b10.047\u00a0W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075\u00a0W/m2.[93] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49\u00a0K (\u2212224.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371.5\u00a0\u00b0F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[94] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[16] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit upward heat transport;[17][93] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[16]\n\n\nIn a 2021 study, the ice giants' interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing minerals like olivine and ferropericlase, thus showing that large amounts of magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of Uranus and Neptune. If Uranus has more of this magnesium than Neptune, it could form a thermal insulation layer, thus potentially explaining the planet's low temperature.[95]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Uranus\n\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300\u00a0km below the 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa) and temperature of 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F).[96] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[97] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of \u2212300 and 50\u00a0km (\u2212186 and 31\u00a0mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa to 10\u00a0kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000\u00a0km (31 and 2,485\u00a0mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10\u221210\u00a0bar (10\u00a0kPa to 10\u00a0\u00b5Pa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000\u00a0km to as high as 50,000\u00a0km from the surface.[17] There is no mesosphere.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Uranus atmosphere's composition and layers, along with the graph of its pressure\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[17] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 0.15\u00b10.03[21] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 0.26\u00b10.05.[17][93] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275\u00b10.01,[98] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[17] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH4).[17] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[17] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3\u00a0bar (130\u00a0kPa); this represents about 20 to 30\u00a0times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[17][20][99]\n\n\nThe mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[100] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[17][101] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[102] They include ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), and diacetylene (C2HC2H).[100][103][104] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Troposphere[edit]\n\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[17] The temperature falls from about 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at \u2212300\u00a0km to 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) at 50\u00a0km.[96][99] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57\u00a0K (\u2212224 and \u2212216\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212371 and \u2212357\u00a0\u00b0F) depending on planetary latitude.[17][92] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0K (\u2212214.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212353.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[92][93]\n\n\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100\u00a0bar (5 to 10\u00a0MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40\u00a0bar (2 to 4\u00a0MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10\u00a0bar (0.3 and 1\u00a0MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2\u00a0bar (0.1 to 0.2\u00a0MPa).[17][20][96][106] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[22]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus's upper atmosphere taken during the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program.[107]\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53\u00a0K (\u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212364\u00a0\u00b0F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850\u00a0K (527 and 577\u00a0\u00b0C; 980 and 1,070\u00a0\u00b0F) at the base of the thermosphere.[97] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[108] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[102] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[108] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300\u00a0km corresponding to a pressure range of 1000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between 75 and 170\u00a0K (\u2212198 and \u2212103\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212325 and \u2212154\u00a0\u00b0F).[100][103]\n\n\nThe most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10\u22127 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[100][103][105] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[103] The abundance ratio of water is around 7\u00d710\u22129.[104] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of the stratosphere and tropopause (below 10\u00a0mBar level) forming haze layers,[102] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[100][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Planet Uranus - North Pole - Cyclone (VLA; October 2021)\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800\u00a0K (527\u00a0\u00b0C) to 850\u00a0K (577\u00a0\u00b0C).[17][109] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1\u00a0mBar pressure levels may contribute too.[97][109] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000\u00a0km (31,000\u00a0mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[97][109]\n\n\nThis extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[109] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[97] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[99] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000\u00a0km (1,200 to 6,200\u00a0mi).[99] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[109][110] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[111] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Uranus\n\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[22] When *Voyager\u00a02* flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of 10 cloud features across the entire planet.[113][114] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat is markedly lower than that of the other giant planets, as stated previously Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\n\n### Banded structure, winds and clouds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 2*'s timelapse of Uranus's dynamic atmosphere\nIn 1986, *Voyager\u00a02* found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[113] Their boundary is located at about \u221245\u00b0 of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from \u221245 to \u221250\u00b0 is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[113][115] It is called a southern \"collar\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2\u00a0bar (see above).[116] Besides the large-scale banded structure, *Voyager\u00a02* observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[113] In all other respects, Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.\n\n\n*Voyager\u00a02* arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[115] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[115] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45\u00b0 of latitude.[117] In 2023, a team employing the Very Large Array observed a dark collar at 80\u00b0 latitude, and a bright spot at the north pole, indicating the presence of a polar vortex.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first dark spot observed on Uranus. Image obtained by the HST ACS in 2006.\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably, partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[22] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[22] An early explanation\u2014that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them \u2013 was shown to be incorrect.[119][120] Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[120] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[120] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby.[22][114] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[22] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[121] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[122]\n\n\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[22] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from \u2212360 to \u2212180\u00a0km/h (\u2212220 to \u2212110\u00a0mph).[22][115] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near \u00b120\u00b0 latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[22][92] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at \u00b160\u00b0 latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[22] Wind speeds at \u221240\u00b0 latitude range from 540 to 720\u00a0km/h (340 to 450\u00a0mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[22] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860\u00a0km/h (540\u00a0mph) are observed near +50\u00b0 latitude.[22][115][123]\n\n\n\n### Seasonal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus in 2005. Rings, southern collar and a bright cloud in the northern hemisphere are visible (HST ACS image).\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[120][124] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820\u00a0km/h (510\u00a0mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \"Fourth of July fireworks\".[114] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric activity.[121] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[125][122] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere has existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[126] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[127] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[108] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry.[119]\n\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[122] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[126] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[122] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes in brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[122]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[116] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[114] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[120] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[117]\n\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[122] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[116] The bright collar at \u221245\u00b0 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[116] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[116] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[128] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[114][128]\n\n\n\n## Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The magnetic field of Uranus  \n(animated; 25 March 2020)\nBefore the arrival of *Voyager\u00a02*, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[129]\n\n\n*Voyager*'s observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59\u00b0 from the axis of rotation.[129][130] In fact, the magnetic dipole is shifted from Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one-third of the planetary radius.[129] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1\u00a0gauss (10\u00a0\u00b5T), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1\u00a0gauss (110\u00a0\u00b5T).[129] The average field at the surface is 0.23\u00a0gauss (23\u00a0\u00b5T).[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)A diagram showing Uranus's asymmetric magnetosphere\nStudies of *Voyager\u00a02* data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[131] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \"magnetic equator\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[130] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50\u00a0times that of Earth.[129][130] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[130] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water\u2013ammonia ocean.[83][132] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[89]\n\n\n\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[129][130][133] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[129][130] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[129][134]\n\n![](image)Aurorae on Uranus taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) installed on Hubble.[135]Uranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[130][133] Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[133] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2\u00a0megaelectronvolts, respectively.[133] The density of low-energy (below 1\u00a0kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2\u00a0cm\u22123.[136] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[133] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000\u00a0years.[133] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[137]\n\n\nUranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[109] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[112] In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the *Voyager\u00a02* space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Uranus\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n![](image)Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos. From left to right, they are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.

Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[113] They are ice\u2013rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[137][141]\n\n\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest.[113][137] Miranda has fault canyons 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[113] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[142] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[143][144] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[145]\n\n\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun\u2013Uranus L3 Lagrangian point\u2014a gravitationally unstable region at 180\u00b0 in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[146][147] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit.\n2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[147]\n\n\n\n## Rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus's rings and atmosphere as imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared camera.The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[113] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the \u03b5 ring. All except the two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow \u2013 they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[137][148]\n\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[149][150] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[151] Later they detected four additional rings.[151] The rings were directly imaged when *Voyager\u00a02* passed Uranus in 1986.[113] *Voyager\u00a02* also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[152] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[153][154] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[153][155] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[153]\n\n\nAlthough the Uranian rings are very difficult to directly observe from Earth, advances in digital imaging have allowed several amateur astronomers to successfully photograph the rings with red or infrared filters; telescopes with apertures as small as 36 cm (14 inches) may be able to detect the rings with proper imaging equipment.[156]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus as seen from the *Cassini* spacecraft at Saturn\nLaunched in 1977, *Voyager\u00a02* made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500\u00a0km (50,600\u00a0mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[99] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. Voyager 2 examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[113][137][157] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[129]\n\n\nNo other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then, though there have been many proposed missions to revisit the Uranus system. The possibility of sending the *Cassini* spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere,[158] as it would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[158] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1\u20135 atmospheres.[159] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013\u20132022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisaged launch during 2020\u20132023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[159] The committee's opinion was reaffirmed in 2022, when a Uranus probe/orbiter mission was placed at the highest priority, due to the lack of knowledge about ice giants.[160]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n* In astrology, the planet Uranus (symbol ![Uranus's astrological symbol](image)) is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Because Uranus is cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the colour electric blue, which is close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius[161] (see Uranus in astrology).\n* The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, was named after the then-newly discovered Uranus.[162]\n* Lydia Sigourney included her poem ![](image) The Georgian Planet in her 1827 collection of poetry.\n* \"Uranus, the Magician\" is a movement in Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, written between 1914 and 1916.\n* Operation Uranus was the successful military operation in World War II by the Red Army to take back Stalingrad and marked the turning point in the land war against the Wehrmacht.\n* The lines \"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/When a new planet swims into his ken\", from John Keats's \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", are a reference to Herschel's discovery of Uranus.[163]\n* In English language popular culture, humor is often derived from the common pronunciation of Uranus' name, which resembles that of the phrase \"your anus\".[164]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 QF99 and 2014 YX49, the only two known Uranus trojans\n* Colonisation of Uranus\n* Extraterrestrial diamonds (thought to be abundant in Uranus)\n* Outline of Uranus\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n* Uranus in astrology\n* Uranus in fiction\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  These are the mean elements from VSOP87, together with derived quantities.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g***  Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n3. **^**  Calculated using data from Seidelmann, 2007.[11]\n4. **^**  Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n5. **^**  Calculation of He, H2 and CH4 molar fractions is based on a 2.3% mixing ratio of methane to hydrogen and the 15/85 He/H2 proportions measured at the tropopause.\n6. **^**  Because, in the English-speaking world, the latter sounds like \"your anus\", the former pronunciation also saves embarrassment: as Pamela Gay, an astronomer at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, noted on her podcast, to avoid \"being made fun of by any small schoolchildren\u00a0... when in doubt, don't emphasise anything and just say /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/.

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17\u00a0times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8\u00a0years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5\u00a0billion kilometres; 2.8\u00a0billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ![\u2646](image), representing Neptune's trident.[d]\n\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23\u00a0September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th\u00a0century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by *Voyager\u00a02*, when it flew by the planet on 25\u00a0August 1989; *Voyager\u00a02* remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[18][19] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.\n\n\nLike the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of *ices* such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[20] both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them.[21] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[22] The blue colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to the thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.[23][24][25]\n\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100\u00a0km/h (580\u00a0m/s; 1,300\u00a0mph).[27] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55\u00a0K (\u2212218\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212361\u00a0\u00b0F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400\u00a0K (5,100\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,300\u00a0\u00b0F).[28][29] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by *Voyager 2*.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei\nSome of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo Galilei's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match with what is now known to have been the positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close\u2014in conjunction\u2014to Jupiter in the night sky.[31] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[32] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least aware that the \"star\" he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars.[33]\n\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[34] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[35] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February\u00a01844. Adams continued to work in 1845\u20131846 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Urbain Le Verrier\nIn 1845\u20131846, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June\u00a01846, upon seeing Le\u00a0Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.[35][38] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, Johann Gottfried Galle, and on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[39][35][40]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Le\u00a0Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le\u00a0Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23\u00a0September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1\u00b0 from the \"*five degrees east of Delta Capricorn*\" position Le\u00a0Verrier had predicted it to be,[41][42] about 12\u00b0 from Adams's prediction, and on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.\n\n\nIn the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le\u00a0Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nShortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le\u00a0Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name *Janus*. In England, Challis put forward the name *Oceanus*.[45]\n\n\nClaiming the right to name his discovery, Le\u00a0Verrier quickly proposed the name *Neptune* for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.[46] In October, he sought to name the planet *Le\u00a0Verrier*, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, Fran\u00e7ois Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France.[47] French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name *Herschel* for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir\u00a0William Herschel, and *Leverrier* for the new planet.[48]\n\n\nStruve came out in favour of the name *Neptune* on 29\u00a0December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences,[49] after the colour of the planet as viewed through a telescope.[50] Soon, *Neptune* became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.[e][51]\n\n\nMost languages today use some variant of the name \"Neptune\" for the planet; indeed, in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"sea king star\" (\u6d77\u738b\u661f).[52][53] In Mongolian, Neptune is called *Dalain van* (\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called *Poseidon* (\u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, *Poseidonas*), the Greek counterpart of Neptune.[54] In Hebrew, *Rahab* (\u05e8\u05d4\u05d1), from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms, was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing Latin term *Neptun* (\u05e0\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05df) is commonly used.[55][56] In M\u0101ori, the planet is called *Tangaroa*, named after the M\u0101ori god of the sea.[57] In Nahuatl, the planet is called *Tl\u0101locc\u012btlalli*, named after the rain god Tl\u0101loc.[57] In Thai, Neptune is referred to by its Westernised name *Dao Nepchun/Nepjun* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e08\u0e39\u0e19), but is also called *Dao Ket* (\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e01\u0e15\u0e38, lit.\u2009'star of Ketu'), after Ketu (\u0915\u0947\u0924\u0941), the descending lunar node, who plays a role in Hindu astrology. In Malay, the name *Waruna*, after the Hindu god of seas, is attested as far back as the 1970s,[58] but was eventually superseded by the Latinate equivalents *Neptun* (in Malaysian[59]) or *Neptunus* (in Indonesian[60]).\n\n\nThe usual adjectival form is *Neptunian*. The nonce form *Poseidean* (/p\u0259\u02c8sa\u026adi\u0259n/), from Poseidon, has also been used,[4] though the usual adjectival form of Poseidon is *Poseidonian* (/\u02ccp\u0252sa\u026a\u02c8do\u028ani\u0259n/).[61]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nFrom its discovery in 1846 until the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer than Neptune to the Sun, making Neptune the ninth planet from the Sun during this period.[62][63] The increasingly accurate estimations of Pluto's mass from ten times that of Earth's to far less than that of the Moon[64] and the discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[65][66] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[67]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A size comparison of Neptune and Earth\nNeptune's mass of 1.0243\u00d71026\u00a0kg[7] is intermediate between Earth and the larger gas giants: it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter.[f] Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15\u00a0m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth,[68] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[69] Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764\u00a0km[10] is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\nNeptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core. Pressure in the atmosphere reaches about 10\u00a0GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physical and chemical composition of Neptune's interior\nThe mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane.[1] As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid (supercritical fluid). This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean.[72] The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.[73] At a depth of 7,000\u00a0km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones.[74][75][76] Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[77][75] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.[78][79][80]\n\n\nThe core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth.[81] The pressure at the centre is 7\u00a0Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400\u00a0K.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combined colour and near-infrared image of Neptune, showing bands of methane in its atmosphere, and four of its moons, Proteus, Larissa, Galatea, and Despina\nA time-lapse video of Neptune and its moons\nAt high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.[28] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600\u00a0nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neptune - cloud cover over three decades (1994-2023)[84]\nNeptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10\u00a0kPa).[21] The stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10\u22125 to 10\u22124 bars (1 to 10\u00a0Pa).[21] The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck.\nModels suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude.[84] The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0\u00a0MPa), where the temperature reaches 273\u00a0K (0\u00a0\u00b0C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.[85]\n\n\nHigh-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitudes. These circumferential bands have widths of 50\u2013150\u00a0km and lie about 50\u2013110\u00a0km above the cloud deck.[86] These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. In August 2023, the clouds of Neptune vanished, possibly due to \"solar flare\".[84] Thirty years of observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes showed that Neptune's cloud activity is bound to Solar cycles, and not to the planet's seasons.[87][88]\n\n\nNeptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne.[21][28] The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.[21][89] The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.[21]\n\n\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750\u00a0K.[90][91] The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.[85][89]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nNeptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47\u00b0 and offset at least 0.55\u00a0radius, or about 13,500\u00a0km from the planet's physical centre. Before *Voyager 2*'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[85] resulting in a dynamo action.[92]\n\n\nThe dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14\u00a0microteslas (0.14\u00a0G).[93] The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017\u00a0T\u00b7m3 (14\u00a0\u03bcT\u00b7*R**N*3, where *R**N* is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of an offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.[94][95]\n\n\nMeasurements by *Voyager 2* in extreme-ultraviolet and radio frequencies revealed that Neptune has faint and weak but complex and unique aurorae; however, these observations were limited in time and did not contain infrared. Subsequent astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have not glimpsed the aurorae, in contrast to the more well-defined aurorae of Uranus.[96][97]\n\n\nNeptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23\u201326.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.[94]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud),[98] and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated.\nNeptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600\u00a0m/s (2,200\u00a0km/h; 1,300\u00a0mph)\u2014exceeding supersonic flow.[27] More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20\u00a0m/s in the easterly direction to 325\u00a0m/s westward.[99] At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400\u00a0m/s along the equator to 250\u00a0m/s at the poles.[85] Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.[100] The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a \"skin effect\" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.[21] At 70\u00b0 S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300\u00a0m/s.[21]\n\n\nNeptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. *Voyager 2* observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby,[101] but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.\n\n\nThe abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10\u2013100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.[21]\n\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73\u00a0K (\u2212200\u00a0\u00b0C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole.[102] The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.[103]\n\n\nBecause of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.[104]\n\n\n\n### Storms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a06,600\u00a0km (8,100\u00a0mi \u00d7\u00a04,100\u00a0mi)[101] was discovered by NASA's *Voyager 2* spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.[105]\n\n\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the *Voyager 2* encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by *Voyager 2*).[100] The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as *Voyager 2* approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.[106] In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] In 2023, the first ground-based observation of a dark spot on Neptune was announced.[107]\n\n\nNeptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features,[108] so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.[86] Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer.[109] The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other, unknown mechanism.[110]\n\n\n\n* ![The appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]](image)\n\nThe appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]\n* ![The Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]](image)\n\nThe Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]\n* ![The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2](image)\n\nThe Great Dark Spot in a color-uncalibrated image by *Voyager 2.*\n* ![Neptune's shrinking vortex[113]](image)\n\nNeptune's shrinking vortex[113]\n\n\n### Internal heating[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Four images taken a few hours apart with the NASA/ESA *Hubble Space Telescope*'s Wide Field Camera 3. Near infrared radiation data has been used as red channel.[114]\nNeptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8\u00a0K (\u2212221.3\u00a0\u00b0C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa), the temperature is 72.00\u00a0K (\u2212201.15\u00a0\u00b0C).[115] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun;[116] whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.[117] Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% of its amount of sunlight,[21] yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.[118]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neptune (red arc) completes one orbit around the Sun (centre) for every 164.79 orbits of Earth. The light blue object represents Uranus.\nThe average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.5 billion km (about 30.1\u00a0astronomical units (AU)), and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79\u00a0years, subject to a variability of around \u00b10.1\u00a0years. The perihelion distance is 29.81\u00a0AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33\u00a0AU.[g]\n\n\nOn 11\u00a0July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846,[120] although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26\u00a0day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.[11][121][122]\n\n\nThe elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77\u00b0 compared to that of Earth.\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32\u00b0,[123] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23\u00b0) and Mars (25\u00b0). As a result, Neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[104] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11\u00a0hours.[11] Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.\n\n\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18\u00a0hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12\u00a0hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,[124] and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.[86]\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital resonances[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kuiper belt, resonant trans-Neptunian object, and Neptune trojan\n\n![](image)A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant \"classical belt\" (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos).\nNeptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30\u00a0AU out to about 55\u00a0AU from the Sun.[125] Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in its structure. The region between 40 and 42\u00a0AU is an example.[126]\n\n\nThere do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects,[127] is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them.[128] Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.[129] The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.[130]\n\n\nNeptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the Sun\u2013Neptune L4 and L5 Lagrangian points\u2014gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in its orbit, respectively.[131] Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured. The first object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing L5 Lagrangian point was 2008 LC18.[132] Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite, (309239) 2007 RW10.[133] The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years.[133]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Nice model\n\n![](image)A simulation showing the outer planets and Kuiper belt: a) before Jupiter and Saturn reached a 2:1 resonance; b) after inward scattering of Kuiper belt objects following the orbital shift of Neptune; c) after ejection of scattered Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter\nThe formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.[70]\n\n\nAn alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.[134] This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.[135] The current most widely accepted[136][137][138] explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.\n\n\n\n## Moons and rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Neptune\n\nFor a timeline of discovery dates, see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons.\n\n![Shown in this image are Neptune and its moons: Triton, Galatea, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Proteus, and Larissa](image)An annotated picture of Neptune's many moons as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. The bright blue diffraction star is Triton, Neptune's largest moon.\nNeptune has 14 known moons.[7][139] Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[h] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17\u00a0days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.[140] It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6\u00a0billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.[141] In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System,[142] with estimated temperatures of 38\u00a0K (\u2212235\u00a0\u00b0C).[143]\n\n\nNeptune's second-known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.[i]\n\n\nFrom July to September 1989, *Voyager 2* discovered six moons of Neptune.[144] Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity.[145] Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons\u2014Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea\u2014orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when *Voyager 2* observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.[146][147] A new moon and the smallest yet, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images.[148] Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Neptune\n\n![](image)Neptune's rings and moons viewed in infrared by the James Webb Space Telescope\nNeptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn.[149] The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.[150] The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000\u00a0km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000\u00a0km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000\u00a0km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000\u00a0km.[151]\n\n\nThe first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan.[30][152] In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.[153]\nEvidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion.[154] Images from *Voyager 2* in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.\n\n\nThe outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named *Courage*, *Libert\u00e9*, *Egalit\u00e9\u00a01*, *Egalit\u00e9\u00a02* and *Fraternit\u00e9* (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).[155] The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.[156][157]\n\n\nEarth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings were much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by *Voyager 2*. In particular, it seems that the *Libert\u00e9* arc might disappear in as little as one century.[158]\n\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Movement of Neptune in front of the stars of Aquarius in 2022\n![Neptune visible in the night sky](image)In 2018, the European Southern Observatory used adaptive optics to get clear and high-resolution images of Neptune from the surface of Earth.\nNeptune brightened about 10% between 1980 and 2000 mostly due to the changing of the seasons.[159] Neptune may continue to brighten as it approaches perihelion in 2042. The apparent magnitude currently ranges from 7.67 to 7.89 with a mean of 7.78 and a standard deviation of 0.06.[15] Prior to 1980, the planet was as faint as magnitude 8.0.[15] Neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. It can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe.[160] A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.[161]\n\n\nBecause of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4\u00a0arcseconds,[7][17] the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).[162][163][164] The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[165] Neptune is currently approaching perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both *Hubble* and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.[166]\n\n\nFrom Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367\u00a0days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[122]\n\n\nNeptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[41]\n\n\nObservation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field.[85] In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.[167]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Neptune\n\n![](image)A *Voyager 2* mosaic of Triton\n*Voyager 2* is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft's closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for *Voyager 1*'s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from *Voyager 2* became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, *Neptune All Night*.[168]\n\n\nDuring the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246\u00a0minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, *Voyager 2*'s mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400\u00a0km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.[169]\n\n\nThe spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and *Voyager 2* also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.[144][169]\n\n\nThe flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which was found to be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered Planet X acted upon the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.[170][171]\n\n\nSince 2018, the China National Space Administration has been studying a concept for a pair of *Voyager*-like interstellar probes tentatively known as *Interstellar Express* or *Interstellar Heliosphere Probe*.[172] Both probes will be launched at the same time in 2024 and take differing paths to explore opposing ends of the heliosphere; the second probe, *IHP-2*, will fly by Neptune in January 2038, passing only 1,000\u00a0km above the cloud tops, and potentially carry an atmospheric impactor to be released during its approach.[173] Afterward, it will continue on its mission throughout the Kuiper belt toward the tail of the heliosphere, so far unexplored.\n\n\nAfter *Voyager 2* and *IHP-2*'s flybys, the next step in scientific exploration of the Neptunian system is considered to be an orbital mission; most proposals have been by NASA, most often for a Flagship orbiter.[174] Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s.[174] However, there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's \"Vision Missions Studies\" for a \"Neptune Orbiter with Probes\" mission that does *Cassini*-level science.[175] A subsequent proposal was for *Argo*, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019, that would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object. The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around 2029.[176] The proposed *New Horizons 2* mission (which was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system. Currently a pending proposal for the Discovery program, *Trident* would conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton;[177] however, the mission was not selected for Discovery 15 or 16. *Neptune Odyssey* is the current mission concept for a Neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe being studied as a possible large strategic science mission by NASA that would launch between 2031 and 2033, and arrive at Neptune by 2049.[178]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Neptune\n* Hot Neptune\n* Neptune in astrology\n* Neptunium\n* *Neptune, the Mystic* \u2013 one of the seven movements in Gustav Holst's *Planets* suite\n* Timeline of the far future\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Orbital elements refer to the Neptune barycentre and Solar System barycentre.
