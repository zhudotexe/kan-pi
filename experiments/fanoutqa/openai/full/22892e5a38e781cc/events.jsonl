One of its ten founding ministers, Abraham Pierson, became its first Rector, the administrative and ecclesiastical head of the college. After Pierson, four more ministers served as rectors of the collegiate school, until 1745 when Yale College was chartered by the Colony of Connecticut and Thomas Clap's title was changed to president. In 1878, Yale incorporated as a university, and incumbent Timothy Dwight V became the last president of the college and the first of Yale University. The first president not ordained as a minister was Arthur Twining Hadley, inaugurated in 1899; no ordained person has held the office since.\n\n\nThe president is elected by the Yale Corporation, the governing body of the University on which the president sits *ex-officio*. The corporation's bylaws state that the president is \"chief executive officer of the University and as such is responsible for the general direction of all its affairs.\"[1] The president nominates other university officers, including the provost, secretary, and other vice presidents, for election by the corporation. Other top-level administrative positions, such as university chaplain, deans of schools, and masters of residential colleges, are appointed by the president alone.\n\n\nThe university's current president is Peter Salovey, a professor of social psychology who formerly served as University Provost and Dean of Yale College and received his Ph.D. from Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nThe Office of the President is located in Woodbridge Hall, a 1901 building erected specifically for administrative purpose.[2] The university maintains an official home for the president on Hillhouse Avenue, which hosts presidential events. Peter Salovey, inaugurated in 2013, is the first president since 1986 to use the home as his primary residence.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ezra Stiles, by Samuel King\n## Rectors of Yale College (1701–)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Rectors of Yale College[4] | birth–death | years as rector\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abraham Pierson | (1641–1707) | (1701–1707) Collegiate School\n |\n| 2 | Samuel Andrew | (1656–1738) | (1707–1719; *pro tempore*)\n |\n| 3 | Timothy Cutler | (1684–1765) | (1719–1726) 1718/9: renamed Yale College\n |\n| 4 | Elisha Williams | (1694–1755) | (1726–1739)\n |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703–1767) | (1740–1745)\n |\n\n\n## Presidents of Yale College (1740–1878) and Yale University (1878–)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Presidents of Yale College[4] | birth–death | years as president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703–1767) | (1745–1766)\n |\n| 6 | Naphtali Daggett | (1727–1780) | (1766–1777; *pro tempore*) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 7 | Ezra Stiles | (1727–1795) | (1778–1795) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 8 | Timothy Dwight IV | (1752–1817) | (1795–1817)\n |\n| 9 | Jeremiah Day | (1773–1867) | (1817–1846)\n |\n| 10 | Theodore Dwight Woolsey | (1801–1889) | (1846–1871)\n |\n| 11 | Noah Porter III | (1811–1892) | (1871–1886)\n |\n| 12 | Timothy Dwight V | (1828–1916) | (1886–1899) 1887: renamed Yale University\n |\n| 13 | Arthur Twining Hadley | (1856–1930) | (1899–1921)\n |\n| 14 | James Rowland Angell | (1869–1949) | (1921–1937)\n |\n| 15 | Charles Seymour | (1885–1963) | (1937–1951)\n |\n| 16 | Alfred Whitney Griswold | (1906–1963) | (1951–1963)\n |\n| 17 | Kingman Brewster, Jr. | (1919–1988) | (1963–1977)\n |\n| 18 | Hanna Holborn Gray | (1930– ) | (1977–1978; pro tempore)\n |\n| 19 | A.

Built in 1756, the John Maclean House, also known as the President's House, was where the president lived until Prospect House was acquired in 1878.[16] In 1968, the official residence switched again to Walter Lowrie House.[17] The Office of the President is housed in Nassau Hall.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n| No. | President\n | Presidency\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Dickinson](image) | Jonathan Dickinson | 1747\n | Died shortly after entering office from a pleuritic illness[19] | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![Portrait of Aaron Burr, Sr.](image) | Aaron Burr Sr. | 1748–1757[b] | Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark.[21] Father of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States.[22] Died from illness while in office.[23] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | David Cowell | 1757-1758\n | Served as acting president.[11] | [11] |\n| 3\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Edwards](image) | Jonathan Edwards | 1758\n | Eminent theologian to the First Great Awakening.[24][25] Died five weeks into office after a fever from a smallpox vaccine.[26] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | Jacob Green | 1758–1759\n | Delegate for Morris County to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey.[27] Father of Ashbel Green, 8th president of the university.[28][27] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 4\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Davies](image) | Samuel Davies | 1759–1761\n | Died shortly after entering office from pneumonia[29] | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Finley](image) | Samuel Finley | 1761–1766\n | Founder of West Nottingham Academy;[30][31] Minister of the Cold Spring Presbyterian Church.[32] Graduate of the Log College.[33] Died while in office in Philadelphia seeking medical treatment.[34] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | John Blair | 1767–1768\n | Graduate of the Log College.[33] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 6\n | ![Portrait of John Witherspoon](image) | John Witherspoon | 1768–1794\n | Signer of the Declaration of Independence; Delegate to the Second Continental Congress; Moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.[35] Died while in office.[36] | [6] |\n| 7\n | ![Portrait of Samuel S.

Brown's current campus on College Hill is established with the construction of University Hall (1770). The college closes in December 1776 due to the American Revolution and reopens in September 1782.[1] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Jonathan Maxcy | 1787 | 1768–1820 | 1792–1802 | First *alum* to be president and youngest president in Brown's history; Maxcy's reputation as a skilled orator benefited the reputation of the fledgling college.[2][3] Enrollment passed 100 students (1800).\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Asa Messer | 1790 | 1769–1836 | 1802–1826 | The *College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations* was renamed *Brown University* following a gift from Nicholas Brown, Jr (1804). A program in medical study was organized (1811) following the examples set by Harvard and Dartmouth.

A medical program was re-established (1972).[13] |\n| 15\n |  | Howard Swearer | – | 1932–1991 | 1977–1988 | Under Swearer's leadership, Brown advanced in rankings, saw a threefold increase in research grants, quadrupled its previously-dwindling endowment, and grew in popularity.[14][15] The Watson Institute was founded as the Institute for International Studies (1986). Brown's athletic facilities expanded significantly with the construction of both the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center (1981) and the Pizzitola Sports Center (1988).[16] |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Vartan Gregorian | – | 1934–2021 | 1989–1997 | Vartan Gregorian was Brown's first foreign-born president.
