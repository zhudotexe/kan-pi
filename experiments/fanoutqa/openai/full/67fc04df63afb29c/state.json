The 114th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to 2004, and their ninth in franchise history. This was the second World Series matchup between the two franchises, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in 1916. The series was sponsored by the Internet television service YouTube TV and officially known as the *2018 World Series presented by YouTube TV*.[2]\n\n\nThe Series was televised in the United States on Fox. Steve Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while Alex Cora became the fifth first-season manager[3] and first manager from Puerto Rico[4] to win the World Series. The Series was notable for its third game which lasted 18 innings, a World Series record.\n\n\nThe 2018 World Series was the first since 2000 to feature two teams which had also reached the postseason in the prior year. Additionally, the Red Sox became the first team to win two World Series exactly one century apart, as they had defeated the Chicago Cubs in 1918, while the Dodgers were the first team since the 2011 Texas Rangers, and the first NL team since the 1992 Atlanta Braves, to lose consecutive World Series.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2018 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThe Boston Red Sox' most recent World Series appearance was their 2013 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won a World Series in 1988 over the Oakland Athletics, made their second consecutive appearance, after losing to the Houston Astros in 2017. The two franchises faced each other in the 1916 World Series; the Red Sox won the series in five games against the then-Brooklyn Robins.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A scorebook from the 1916 World Series\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts were teammates on the Dodgers in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Although they did not play together on the Red Sox, both managers played and won a World Series championship with Boston\u2014Roberts in 2004 and Cora in 2007. This was the first World Series with two managers of color;[6] additionally, both managers were born outside the contiguous United States, as Cora was born in Puerto Rico and Roberts in Japan.[7]\n\n\nWhile this was a rare match-up, with the Dodgers-Red Sox having only met 20 times ever, the Dodgers trade deadline acquisition Manny Machado had a long history with the Red Sox. In a game in April 2017, Machado, then with the Baltimore Orioles, aggressively slid over the second base bag and spiked Dustin Pedroia in the knee. Pedroia missed 56 of the remaining 145 games, twice going on the injured list. The Red Sox responded by throwing at Machado throughout the 2017 season, feeling that the slide was a dirty play.[8] Setbacks to his recovery left Pedroia out of the lineup for all but 11 at-bats during the 2018 season. Before the World Series, Pedroia told WEEI\u2019s Rob Bradford about the slide. \u201cI think about it all the time.\u201d And when Bradford asked if there\u2019s been any contact with Machado since then, Pedroia had a terse response, \u201cno.\u201d[9] In the 2018 World Series, Machado was booed heavily at Fenway Park. By the time of his retirement in 2021, Pedroia said he had forgiven Machado and he was \"at peace with the play.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Boston Red Sox season\n\nThe Red Sox finished with a 108\u201354 (.667) record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees,[11] and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason.[12] The Red Sox surpassed the 100-win mark for the first time since 1946, broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912, and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116.[13] The 2018 Red Sox were highlighted by All-Stars Mookie Betts, Craig Kimbrel, J. D. Martinez, and Chris Sale. Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in. Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts. Kimbrel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters in 62.1 innings.\n\n\nThe Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series.[14] Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the League Championship Series.[15] Including their 2004 win that ended the Curse of the Bambino, this was the fourth World Series appearance by the Red Sox in 15 years and their 13th appearance all-time.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\nDespite a 16\u201326 (.381) start to the season and nine losses in an 11-game stretch in mid-August, the Dodgers made the playoffs for the sixth straight year by winning the division in a one-game tiebreaker over the Rockies. At the July trade deadline, the team traded for All-Star shortstop Manny Machado from the Orioles to replace injured shortstop Corey Seager and a former All-Star second baseman Brian Dozier from the Twins. In August, the Dodgers acquired former World Series MVP David Freese from the Pirates. For the second year in a row, the Dodgers broke their franchise record for most team home runs in a season.[16] With a 92\u201371 (.564) record, the team entered the playoffs as a second seed and went on to beat the Atlanta Braves in four games in the 2018 National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games in the 2018 National League Championship Series,[17] becoming the first team in either league to win Game 7 of a League Championship Series on the road since the 2006 Cardinals.\n\n\nThe 2018 Dodgers were the first team to make the World Series by winning their tie-breaker game since the 2007 Colorado Rockies, who also faced and lost to Boston in that World Series. This was the Dodgers' fifth back-to-back World Series appearance (Two came in Brooklyn in 1952\u20131953 and 1955\u20131956, and two came in Los Angeles in 1965\u20131966 and 1977\u20131978), and the first time since the 2014-15 Kansas City Royals to win back-to-back League Championship Series. Overall, this was the Dodgers' 20th World Series appearance.[18]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nFenway Park\n![](image)\nDodger Stadium\n\n*Boston won the series, 4\u20131.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 23 | Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 4, **Boston Red Sox** \u2013 8 | Fenway Park | 3:52 | 38,454[19] |\n| 2 | October 24 | Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 2, **Boston Red Sox** \u2013 4 | Fenway Park | 3:12 | 38,644[20] |\n| 3 | October 26 | Boston Red Sox \u2013 2, **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 3 (18) | Dodger Stadium | 7:20 | 53,114[21] |\n| 4 | October 27 | **Boston Red Sox** \u2212 9, Los Angeles Dodgers \u2212 6 | Dodger Stadium | 3:57 | 54,400[22] |\n| 5 | October 28 | **Boston Red Sox** \u2013 5, Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 1 | Dodger Stadium | 3:00 | 54,367[23] |\n\n\n## Pre-game ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n* **Game 1**: The national anthem was performed by James Taylor.[24] Boston Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski threw the ceremonial first pitch, as he did before Game 1 in 2004, 2007, and 2013.[25][26] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, accompanied by Hall of Famer Jim Rice.[27]\n* **Game 2**: The national anthem was performed by the Boston Pops along with vocalists from the Boston Children's Chorus and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.[28] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by members of the 2004 Red Sox championship team, including David Ortiz and Hall of Famer Pedro Mart\u00ednez.[29] While declining to throw a first pitch, Dodgers' manager Dave Roberts, who played on that championship team, greeted teammates from his former team.[30][31] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, accompanied by NESN announcer and former Red Sox All-Star second baseman Jerry Remy.[32]\n* **Game 3**: The national anthem was performed by Brad Paisley.[33] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hall of Famer and former Dodger player, coach and manager Tommy Lasorda, who was accompanied on the field by one of the team's owners, Magic Johnson; the pitch was caught by former Dodger All-Star Steve Garvey.[33] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of West San Gabriel, accompanied by actor Mario Lopez.[33]\n* **Game 4**: A moment of silence was held to honor victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, which had happened that morning.[34] The national anthem was performed by Ryan Tedder.[35] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley to former Dodger Kirk Gibson, recalling Gibson's game-winning home run off Eckersley in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.[36] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, accompanied by actor Anthony Anderson.[35]\n* **Game 5**: The national anthem was performed by Petty Officer Second Class Mike Dalager of the United States Coast Guard.[37] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by former Dodger All-Star Orel Hershiser to former Dodger Mickey Hatcher.[38] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, accompanied by actor J.

Kershaw became the first pitcher to start the first game of the World Series in back-to-back years since Cliff Lee did so in 2009 (for the Phillies) and 2010 (for the Rangers) and the first to do so for the same team since Dave Stewart pitched three consecutive Game 1s for the Oakland Athletics from 1988 to 1990.[40] The Red Sox struck in the first inning when Mookie Betts singled, stole second and then scored on a hit by Andrew Benintendi, who subsequently scored on a single by J. D. Martinez. Boston benefited from Dodgers' first baseman David Freese missing a foul pop-up by Betts, and right fielder Yasiel Puig allowing Benintendi to advance to second base on a late throw to the plate.[41] A homer by Matt Kemp in the second inning gave the Dodgers a run, and an RBI single by Manny Machado in the third inning tied the score, 2\u20132. In the bottom of the third, Steve Pearce grounded into a fielder's choice\u2014which was called an inning-ending double play on the field, but overturned by video review\u2014and the Red Sox regained the lead on an RBI double by Martinez in the following at-bat. In the top of the fifth, a groundout by Machado plated Brian Dozier to even the score, 3\u20133.[42] \nSale wound up pitching into the fifth inning, allowing three runs on five hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. The Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the fifth, and scored the go-ahead run when Xander Bogaerts grounded into a fielder's choice. A single by Rafael Devers off reliever Ryan Madson in the next at-bat made it 5\u20133. Kershaw's final line was five runs on seven hits and three walks with five strikeouts in four-plus innings. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh off reliever Ryan Brasier and scored a run on a sacrifice fly by Machado. Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez hit a pinch-hit three-run home run off Alex Wood in the bottom of the seventh to make it a four-run lead for the Red Sox, 8\u20134, with no further scoring in the game.[43] Boston reliever Matt Barnes, who finished the fifth inning after relieving Sale, got the win, while Kershaw took the loss for Los Angeles.[44]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Boston starter David Price got the win in Game 2, his second win of the 2018 postseason.\n\n\nOctober 24, 2018, 8:10\u00a0pm (EDT) at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, 47\u00a0\u00b0F (8\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0\n |\n| **Boston** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 8 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** David Price (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Hyun-jin Ryu (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Craig Kimbrel (1)**Attendance:** 38,644Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 2 featured another matchup of left-handed pitchers; Boston started David Price, who got the win in Game 5 of the 2018 American League Championship Series, while Los Angeles started Hyun-jin Ryu, who took the loss in Game 6 of the 2018 National League Championship Series. The Red Sox again scored first, this time in the second inning, when Xander Bogaerts doubled and then scored on a single by Ian Kinsler. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the fourth inning and David Freese scored on a sacrifice fly by Matt Kemp to tie the game; Yasiel Puig then singled to drive in Manny Machado with the go-ahead run. After the Red Sox loaded the bases against Ryu in the bottom of the fifth, reliever Ryan Madson walked in the tying run and J. D. Martinez drove in two more with a single. Ryu's final line was four runs allowed on six hits and one walk with five strikeouts in 42\u20443 innings.[45] \nPrice only allowed two runs on three hits and three walks in six innings while striking out five. Both bullpens prevented more runs from scoring as the Red Sox won, 4\u20132, to take a two games to none lead.[46] Ryu took the loss for the Dodgers, while Price earned the win for Boston with closer Craig Kimbrel getting his sixth save this postseason. It was also the 100th postseason victory in Red Sox franchise history.[47]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Game 3 Full replay on the MLB's official YouTube channel |\n\n\n![](image)Jackie Bradley Jr. tied the game 1-1 with a two-out solo home run in the eighth inning.\n![](image)Max Muncy hit the game-winning home run in the 18th inning of Game 3.\n\n\nOctober 26, 2018, 5:10\u00a0pm (PDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, 78\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Boston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **Los Angeles** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 11 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Alex Wood (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Nathan Eovaldi (0\u20131)**Home runs:**BOS: Jackie Bradley Jr. (1)LAD: Joc Pederson (1), Max Muncy (1)**Attendance:** 53,114Boxscore |\n\n\nAfter two games started by left-handed pitchers, both teams started right-handed pitchers for Game 3; Walker Buehler for the Dodgers and Rick Porcello for the Red Sox. With no designated hitter, J. D. Martinez started in left field for the Red Sox, in place of usual left fielder Andrew Benintendi.[48] The Dodgers scored first, for the first time in the series, when Joc Pederson homered in the third inning. Porcello pitched 42\u20443 innings, allowing the one run on three hits and one walk while striking out five. Buehler pitched seven scoreless innings allowing only two hits with no walks and seven strikeouts. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a home run off Kenley Jansen with two outs in the eighth inning to tie the game. It was Jansen's first blown save in four opportunities this postseason.[49]\n\n\nNo one scored in the ninth after Cody Bellinger was caught between bases to end the ninth and the game went into extra innings tied at one. In the top of the 10th inning, pinch-runner Ian Kinsler attempted to score from third on Rafael Devers's sacrifice fly, but a strong throw by center fielder Bellinger saw Kinsler out at the plate. In the 13th inning, Brock Holt walked, advanced on a wild pitch, scored the go-ahead run on an infield single by Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez and a throwing error by pitcher Scott Alexander. Then, in the bottom of the inning, Max Muncy walked against Nathan Eovaldi, advanced to second on a pop out to N\u00fa\u00f1ez in foul territory (Nu\u00f1ez made a great catch and tumbled into the stands after making the catch, which allowed Muncy to advance) scoring the tying run after an infield hit by Yasiel Puig and a throwing error by Ian Kinsler. In the bottom of the 15th, Muncy appeared to hit a walk-off home run down the right-field line but the ball hooked foul. Muncy hit a walk-off home run off Eovaldi in the 18th inning to win it for the Dodgers, 3\u20132, to cut their series deficit to 2\u20131. Eovaldi had just begun his seventh inning of relief.\n\n\nAt 18 innings and seven hours and 20 minutes, this contest became the longest World Series game by both innings and time, surpassing (in playing time) Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, which lasted 14 innings and five hours and 41 minutes, and breaking the record (in innings) first set in Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, when the Red Sox and Dodgers (then known as the Robins) played 14 innings.[50] \nMuncy tied the record for latest (18th inning) walk-off hit in postseason history, equalling Chris Burke in Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series.[51] It was also the Dodgers' first game-winning World Series home run since Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The game took longer to play than the entire 1939 World Series, which had seven hours and five minutes of total playing time over four games.[52] Until Game 1 of the 2020 World Series, this was the last time a team won a World Series game in their home ballpark.\n\n\nUntil Game 1 of the 2022 World Series, this is the last World Series game to go to extra innings.\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steve Pearce had four RBIs and scored twice in Boston's Game 4 win.\n\n\nOctober 27, 2018, 5:11\u00a0pm (PDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Boston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 8 | 1\n |\n| Los Angeles | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Joe Kelly (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Dylan Floro (0\u20131)**Home runs:**BOS: Mitch Moreland (1), Steve Pearce (1)LAD: Yasiel Puig (1), Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (1)**Attendance:** 54,400Boxscore |\n\n\nFollowing the longest game in World Series history, the Dodgers started Rich Hill while Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez made his first start of the postseason for the Red Sox. At 38 years old, Hill was the oldest player to start a World Series game since 39-year-old Tim Hudson started two games for the San Francisco Giants in 2014 and the oldest for the Dodgers since Sal Maglie in 1956.[53] As he had pitched in relief in Game 3, Rodr\u00edguez became just the sixth pitcher in history to start a World Series game with zero days rest, and the first since Firpo Marberry of the Washington Senators in the 1924 World Series.[54] The Red Sox had intended to start Nathan Eovaldi, but he needed rest after throwing 97 pitches in relief in Game 3.[55] With no designated hitter, the Red Sox started an outfield of Andrew Benintendi, Mookie Betts, and J. D. Martinez, with Jackie Bradley Jr. on the bench in place of Benintendi, who did not start the previous game.[56]\n\n\nThe game was scoreless through the first five innings. In the bottom of the sixth, the Dodgers loaded the bases against Rodr\u00edguez and scored the game's first run on a throwing error by catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez. The next batter, Yasiel Puig, hit a three-run home run to extend the lead to 4\u20130. In a fit of rage, Rodr\u00edguez slammed his glove down on the mound in frustration and was later pulled after pitching 52\u20443 innings, allowing the four runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. At that point, Red Sox ace Chris Sale made an angry speech that fired up his teammates in the dugout.[57] In the top of the seventh, after striking out Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez with a runner on first, Hill was taken off the mound in favor of reliever Ryan Madson, a decision by Roberts which was criticized by several including then-current President Donald Trump.[58] Mitch Moreland hit a three-run pinch-hit home run off of Madson to make it a one-run game. Hill was charged with one run in 6+1\u20443 innings on one hit and three walks with seven strikeouts. Madson set a new World Series record by allowing seven inherited runners to score in the series. Steve Pearce hit a homer off Kenley Jansen in the eighth inning. This was the second straight day Jansen allowed a game-tying home run in that inning.[59] \nJansen became just the second pitcher in World Series history to allow game-tying home runs in back-to-back games (Byung-hyun Kim for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001 was the other). In the top of the ninth, Brock Holt doubled off Dylan Floro and was driven in by a single by pinch hitter Rafael Devers to give Boston their first lead of the game. The Red Sox loaded the bases against Floro and Alex Wood and then Pearce doubled to right-center off Kenta Maeda, scoring all three base runners to put the Red Sox up, 8\u20134. They added another run when Xander Bogaerts drove in Pearce with a single. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez hit a two-run homer off of Craig Kimbrel in the ninth to cut the lead to three. Kimbrel was able to get the last three outs and the Red Sox took a three games to one lead.[60]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Cora, seen here as a player in 2008, led the Red Sox to the World Series championship in his first year as manager.\n\n\nOctober 28, 2018, 5:17\u00a0pm (PDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Boston** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 0\n |\n| Los Angeles | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** David Price (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Clayton Kershaw (0\u20132)**Home runs:**BOS: Steve Pearce 2 (3), Mookie Betts (1), J.

The Red Sox scored in the top of the inning after a one out single by Andrew Benintendi followed by a two-run home run by Steve Pearce. David Freese led off the bottom of the inning with a home run for the Dodgers. No one else scored until the sixth inning, when Mookie Betts hit a home run with one out and then J. D. Martinez hit a lead-off homer in the seventh to make it 4\u20131. Kershaw pitched seven innings, allowing four runs on seven hits, with five strikeouts and no walks.[67] \nIn the eighth inning, Pearce hit another home run, this time off of Pedro B\u00e1ez. Price pitched into the eighth, allowing only one run on three hits and two walks while striking out five. He became just the fifth pitcher to pitch 6+ innings and allow three or fewer hits in three straight postseason starts.[68] Joe Kelly and Chris Sale pitched the last two innings and both struck out the side, Sale getting Manny Machado to strike out for the last out, the Red Sox winning the game 5\u20131 and the title 4\u20131.[69] Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[70]\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n2018 World Series **(4\u20131): Boston Red Sox** (AL) beat Los Angeles Dodgers (NL).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 16 | 34 | 1\n |\n| **Boston Red Sox** | 4 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 1 | 7 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 28 | 42 | 2\n |\n| **Home runs:**LAD: David Freese (1), Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (1), Matt Kemp (1), Max Muncy (1), Joc Pederson (1), Yasiel Puig (1)BOS: Steve Pearce (3), Mookie Betts (1), Jackie Bradley Jr. (1), J.

Joe Buck was the play-by-play announcer, with John Smoltz as the color commentator. Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci were the field reporters.[72] Fox Deportes offered a Spanish-language feed, with Rolando Nichols providing play-by-play and Carlos \u00c1lvarez and Edgar Gonzalez doing color commentary.[73]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, MLB International carried the series with play-by-play by Matt Vasgersian and color commentary by Buck Martinez.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 8.2 | 16 | 13.761 | [74] |\n| 2\n | 8.1 | 15 | 13.458 | [75] |\n| 3\n | 7.9 | 18 | 13.251 | [76] |\n| 4\n | 7.9 | 16 | 13.563 | [77] |\n| 5\n | 10.0 | 18 | 17.634 | [78] |\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio broadcast all the World Series games in English for the 21st straight year as part of *Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio*.[72] Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Chris Singleton serving as color analyst and Buster Olney as field reporter. Marc Kestecher hosted the pre-game show with Olney and Tim Kurkjian reporting. Jon Sciambi called the play-by-play for Game 5 due to Shulman developing laryngitis.[79]\n\n\nESPN Deportes Radio provided Spanish-language coverage of the Series. Eduardo Ortega called the play-by-play and Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, Renato Bermudez, and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Rivera served as analysts.[80]\n\n\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers, which were simulcast over SiriusXM radio. In Los Angeles, the broadcast was on AM 570 LA Sports with Charley Steiner and Rick Monday in English, on Univision America 1020 with Jaime Jarr\u00edn and Jorge Jarr\u00edn in Spanish, and on Radio Korea 1540 AM in Korean. The Red Sox broadcast was on WEEI 93.7 FM in English with Joe Castiglione, Tim Neverett and Lou Merloni, and in Spanish on WCCM 1490 AM with Uri Berenguer.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Red Sox held a victory parade in Boston on October 31.\nThe 2018 World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV, the second consecutive year that the service sponsored the series. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties, on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.[84] As part of the agreement, YouTube TV would later sponsor the 2019 World Series.[2]\n\n\n\n## Celebration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Red Sox at the White House with President Trump on May 9, 2019\nOn the morning of October 31, the Red Sox celebration parade began at Fenway Park and made its way downtown to its final destination on Staniford Street.[85][86] During the celebration, the World Series trophy sustained minor damage from a beer can thrown by a spectator; it was subsequently repaired.[87]\n\n\nAn 80-minute documentary, *2018 World Series: Damage Done*, which was produced by MLB and narrated by Uzo Aduba,[88] was released on December 4.[89]\n\n\nOn December 3, Red Sox president Sam Kennedy announced that team accepted an invitation to visit the White House.[90] Originally planned for February 15, 2019, the visit was postponed to May 9, 2019, due to the 2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown.[91] Alex Cora announced that he would not attend, citing the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico.[92] On May 9, various team members along with owner John W. Henry and president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski visited the White House and met with President Trump.[93][94]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Miscellaneous[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2018\u20132019 off-season, the Dodgers signed former Red Sox reliever Joe Kelly to a three-year deal.[95] Kelly was marvelous in the World Series against the Dodgers, having struck out ten batters and not allowing a run in five games pitched. Kelly, an Angels fan who disliked the Dodgers growing up in Corona,[96] became a fan favorite with Dodger fans throughout his tenure with the team.[97][98]\n\n\nFour months after the 2018 World Series, the Patriots won Super Bowl LIII, meaning the greater Boston area celebrated multiple championships for the 2018 MLB and NFL seasons. Greater Boston accomplished feat 14 years previously when the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, while the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years. Like the \u201818 Red Sox, the Patriots beat a Los Angeles team (the Rams) in the Championship Game.\n\n\nAs of 2024, this is the most recent World Series to have had no games played in Texas. The Houston Astros would win AL pennants in 2019, 2021 and 2022, while the Texas Rangers, who won the AL pennant in 2023, also hosted the 2020 World Series due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n### Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 World Series would be the peak for the 2016\u20132018 Red Sox, who were the first Red Sox teams in franchise history to win the American League East for three straight seasons.[99] President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski was fired on September 9, 2019, just 10 months after winning the 2018 World Series. On the field, Boston's top three starters in 2018 \u2014 Chris Sale, David Price, and Nathan Eovaldi \u2014 all missed significant time due to injury in 2019. Overall, the Red Sox would finish 19 games behind the AL East-leading Yankees in 2019. After the season, the team replaced Dombrowski with Tampa Bay Rays executive Chaim Bloom.\n\n\nThree significant events happened to the Red Sox before the start of the 2020 season that shaped the course of the team's future:\n\n\n\n* On January 7, 2020, the Red Sox were implicated in another sign stealing scandal (the team had previously been fined in 2017 for sign stealing)[100] after three unnamed team members told The Athletic that the Red Sox had used their replay room to steal signs of opposing teams during the 2018 season.[101] On January 13, 2020, Manfred stated that he would determine the appropriate punishment for Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was also implicated in the Astros scandal, when the investigation was completed. The next day, Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways and it was announced he would be suspended for the full season.[102] A few days after his season long suspension ended, Cora was re-hired by the team.\n* On February 10, 2020, the Red Sox traded Mookie Betts, David Price, and cash considerations (Boston would also continue to pay half of Price's contract) to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Alex Verdugo, Connor Wong, and Jeter Downs. The trade was very unpopular among Red Sox fans, as Betts was seen as the Red Sox best player and one of the biggest stars in baseball.[103][104]\n* On March 19, 2020, the team announced that Chris Sale would have to undergo Tommy John surgery, effectively making him unable to pitch for all of 2020 and half of 2021.[105]\n* On April 22, 2020, the Red Sox were found guilty of stealing signs throughout the 2018 season through use of a replay room operator. The replay room operator, J.T. Watkins, was suspended throughout the 2020 season and barred from working in the replay room for the 2021 season. The Red Sox were also fined with the loss of a second-round draft pick during the 2020 draft.[106]\n\n\nThe Red Sox would finish the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season 24\u201336 (.400 winning percentage), which was their worst season since 1965.[107] The team would rebound in 2021 and make it all the way to the ALCS before eventually losing to the Houston Astros in six games.\n\n\nDombrowski would later help lead the Phillies to a World Series appearance as lead executive in 2022. He was the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.[108]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nCorey Seager returned to the Dodgers after being out for most of the 2018 season due to an elbow injury, while Manny Machado, who replaced him after the All-Star break, signed a record free agent contract with the San Diego Padres.[109] The 2019 Dodgers broke the franchise record for wins at 106, but would experience October heartbreak once again by losing to eventual World Champion Washington Nationals in the NLDS in five games. The Dodgers became the second franchise to lose to the eventual World Series champions in four consecutive postseasons (the New York Yankees from 2001 to 2004 were the first).\n\n\nThe Dodgers traded for Mookie Betts during the 2019-2020 off-season and his addition made a great team even better. The Dodgers in 2020 would set the record for best winning percentage in franchise history (.717), win their 8th straight division title, and their first World Series in 32 years. The 2021 and 2022 teams were even better in the regular season, winning over 100 games each year, but both times the Dodgers fell short of the World Series.\n\n\nOver the years, 2018 Red Sox and Dodgers would eventually end up playing for the World Series opposition. Along with Kelly, Price, and Betts, Heath Hembree, Craig Kimbrel, J.D. Martinez, and Ryan Braiser joined the Dodgers in the subsequent years afterwards. On the other hand, Enrique Hernandez, Alex Verdugo, Kenley Jansen, and Justin Turner would later play for Boston. According to sportswriter John Tomase at NBC Sports Boston, up to 25% of the Boston Red Sox\u2019s 2023 projected Opening Day roster were players with direct ties to the Dodgers.[110] Incidentally, J.T. Watkins, the Red Sox video coordinator suspended for one year due to his role in the 2018 scandal, was hired by the Dodgers in 2022.[111]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n* ![photo](image)Los Angeles portal\n\n\n* 2018 Japan Series\n* 2018 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2018 World Series Umpire Crew and Roster\". *www.closecallsports.com*.

The 115th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League champion Houston Astros and the National League champion Washington Nationals. The series was played from October 22 to October 30.[2] Washington upset the favored Astros, four games to three, to secure its first title in franchise history[3] and first in the capital city since the 1924 series. Washington pitcher Stephen Strasburg was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after earning two wins in the series.[4][5]\n\n\nThe Astros had home-field advantage because they had the better regular-season record. It was the third World Series in which home-field advantage was decided by the regular-season records of the American and National league champions, a practice that started in the 2017 season. It was the first World Series in which the Houston Astros had home-field advantage. The series was played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Nationals hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nFor the first time in any of the major North American sports leagues, the visiting team won all the games of a seven-game championship series,[6] surpassing the previous high of five.[7] The road team outscored the home team 49\u201314 in the seven games played. Washington won despite scoring only three runs at home. It was the sixth straight World Series in which the championship was clinched by the visiting team.\n\n\nWith the Nationals being from the National League East, this marked the sixth World Series in a row to have been won by teams from separate divisions in Major League Baseball.[note 2]\n\n\nFor the third straight year, MLB sold presenting sponsorships to all of postseason series. As with the 2017 and 2018 World Series, this World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV and was officially known as the *2019 World Series presented by YouTube TV*.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManagers A. J. Hinch (left) and Dave Martinez (right)\n\nSee also: 2019 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThis was the first World Series appearance for the franchise that began its existence as the Montreal Expos in 1969, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 2005 to become the Nationals. The Nationals were also the last team from the 1969 expansion class (which also included the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers\u2014who began as the Seattle Pilots\u2014and San Diego Padres) to earn a trip to the series. Also, after their World Series appearance, all National League (NL) teams had played in at least one World Series. The only American League (AL) team that has yet to play in a World Series is the Seattle Mariners, who were part of the 1977 expansion. Prior to this series, the Astros and Nationals had never played each other in a postseason series, even though Houston played in the NL from 1962 to 2012 before moving to the AL West in 2013. In fact, the Nationals are the only team the Astros have faced in the World Series that they have never faced in a pre-World Series playoff round, since the Astros have faced the White Sox, Dodgers, and Braves during at least one playoff round prior to the World Series. The Astros and Nationals did not play an interleague game in 2019, and last faced each other during the 2017 regular season. The two teams share a spring training site in West Palm Beach, Florida, and opened the 2019 spring training schedule against each other.[9] This was the second World Series to feature two expansion teams, the first being in 2015 between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets.[note 3][10] The Astros were deemed as heavy favorites to win the title.[11]\n\n\n\n### Washington Nationals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Washington Nationals season\n\nThe Nationals finished the 2018 season with an 82\u201380 (.506) win\u2013loss record, and started the 2019 season with a 19\u201331 (.380) record. Second-year manager Dave Martinez began to receive public pressure to be fired by the Nationals.[12] The team engineered a turnaround and finished the season in second place in the National League East, four games behind the Atlanta Braves, ending the year with a 93\u201369 (.574) record.[13] The Nationals were one of two teams to qualify for the playoffs as a wild card team from the National League.[14] Martinez had missed three games in September for a cardiac catheterization procedure to treat angina.[15]\n\n\nThe fourth-seeded Nationals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers at home in the National League Wild Card Game, coming behind from a 3\u20131 deficit in the eighth inning to win 4\u20133.[16] The Nationals then upset the top-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers, who had won the previous two National League pennants, in the National League Division Series.[17] The Nationals were behind two games to one, and won their second and third elimination games of the postseason to take the best-of-five series. The postseason series win was the first in Washington Nationals history.[note 4] In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series, the Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals (who had defeated the Braves in the Division Series round) in four games to secure the first pennant in franchise history (including their time as the Montreal Expos from 1969 to 2004). It was the first World Series appearance for a team from Washington D.C. since 1933, including 33 seasons that the city did not host an MLB team (1972\u20132004).[18]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Houston Astros season\n\nIn the prior two seasons, the Astros had won the 2017 World Series, the franchise's first World Series championship,[19] and lost the 2018 American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox.[20] The Astros finished the 2019 regular season atop the American League West\u2014their third consecutive division championship\u2014with a 107\u201355 (.660) win\u2013loss record.[21] Their 107 wins were a franchise record, and the most in MLB for the season.[21]\n\n\nThe Astros entered the postseason as the overall #1 seed. Their first opponent in the postseason was determined by the American League Wild Card Game, which saw the Tampa Bay Rays defeat the Oakland Athletics.[22] In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the top-seeded Astros defeated fifth-seeded Tampa Bay in five games, with each game of the series being won by the home team.[23] The Astros' opponent in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS) was the second-seeded New York Yankees, who had defeated the Minnesota Twins in their playoff series, three games to none.[24] In the ALCS, the Astros and Yankee split the first two games, followed by the Astros winning two-of-three games played at Yankee Stadium.[25] Game 6 in Houston was then won by the Astros, giving them the series win, four games to two.[26][27] The Astros' ALCS victory advanced them to their third overall World Series appearance (2 in the American League & one in the National League), and second in three years.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nMinute Maid Park\n![](image)\nNationals Park\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Washington won the series, 4\u20133.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 22 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 5, Houston Astros \u2013 4 | Minute Maid Park | 3:43 | 43,339[29] |\n| 2 | October 23 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 12, Houston Astros \u2013 3 | Minute Maid Park | 4:01 | 43,357[30] |\n| 3 | October 25 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 4, Washington Nationals \u2013 1 | Nationals Park | 4:03 | 43,867[31] |\n| 4 | October 26 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 8, Washington Nationals \u2013 1 | Nationals Park | 3:48 | 43,889[32] |\n| 5 | October 27 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 7, Washington Nationals \u2013 1 | Nationals Park | 3:19 | 43,910[33] |\n| 6 | October 29 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 7, Houston Astros \u2013 2 | Minute Maid Park | 3:37 | 43,384[34] |\n| 7 | October 30 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 2 | Minute Maid Park | 3:42 | 43,326[35] |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\nThe below game summaries include a line score of each game, showing the runs scored by each team during each inning. Various baseball terms appearing in the summaries can be found in the glossary of baseball terms. The performance of pitchers in a game is often summarized by wording such as \"two runs on three hits while striking out four batters\", indicating how many runs and hits the pitcher allowed (the fewer, the better) and how many opposing batters the pitcher struck out (the more, the better).\n\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Juan Soto batted 3-for-4 with three RBIs in Game 1.[36]\n\n\nOctober 22, 2019 7:10\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Max Scherzer (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Gerrit Cole (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Sean Doolittle (1)**Home runs:**WAS: Ryan Zimmerman (1), Juan Soto (1)HOU: George Springer (1)**Attendance:** 43,339Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore the national anthem sung by Nicole Scherzinger, a moment of silence took place in honor of umpire Eric Cooper,[37] who had died on October 20. Former Astro Brian McCann threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Evan Gattis.[37] Max Scherzer started for the Nationals, while Gerrit Cole started for the Astros. With two outs in the bottom of the first inning,[note 5] Yuli Gurriel hit a two-run double, giving the Astros a 2\u20130 lead. In the top of the second inning,[note 6] Ryan Zimmerman hit a home run to cut the Astros' lead to 2\u20131. Juan Soto led off the top of the fourth inning with a home run to tie the game, 2\u20132. Soto became the fourth-youngest player to hit a home run in a World Series; Andruw Jones in 1996 was the youngest to date.[38] Adam Eaton batted in a run in the top of the fifth inning, followed two batters later by a Soto two-run double, giving the Nationals a 5\u20132 lead.[39]\n\n\nScherzer exited after pitching five innings, having allowed two runs on five hits while striking out seven batters. Cole went seven innings, allowing five runs on eight hits while striking out six. After Nationals pitcher Patrick Corbin pitched a scoreless sixth, George Springer led off the bottom of the seventh inning with the 14th postseason home run of his career, off Nats relief pitcher Tanner Rainey.[40] He also broke a World Series record held by Reggie Jackson and Lou Gehrig, with a home run in five consecutive World Series games,[41] dating back to Game\u00a04 of the 2017 World Series. The Astros loaded the bases later in the inning with two walks off Rainey and an infield single off Daniel Hudson, but Hudson struck out Yordan \u00c1lvarez to prevent any more scoring. In the bottom of the eighth inning, pinch hitter Kyle Tucker singled, advanced to second on a fly ball by Aledmys D\u00edaz, and Springer batted in another run with a double, pulling the Astros to within one run, 5\u20134. Sean Doolittle, the Nationals' fifth pitcher of the game, got the final out of the eighth inning and retired the side in order in the bottom of the ninth, concluding matters when Carlos Correa lined out to V\u00edctor Robles to preserve the win. Doolittle earned his second save of the postseason and the underdogs took the series lead, marking the first time in franchise history that the Nationals won a World Series game.[36]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stephen Strasburg earned the win in Game 2.[42]\n\n\nOctober 23, 2019 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 3 | 1 | 12 | 14 | 2\n |\n| Houston | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Stephen Strasburg (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Justin Verlander (0\u20131)**Home runs:**WAS: Kurt Suzuki (1), Adam Eaton (1), Michael A.

After a walk and a single to start the game, Anthony Rendon batted in two runs with a double. Alex Bregman tied the game with a two-run home run in the bottom of the first. In the top of the second inning, Verlander recorded the 200th postseason strikeout of his career, surpassing John Smoltz (whose career spanned 1988\u20132009) and setting a new MLB record.[44]\n\n\nLeading off the top of the seventh, Kurt Suzuki hit a home run to put the Nationals ahead, 3\u20132. Verlander exited one batter later; he was charged with four runs on seven hits while striking out six batters, and was later assessed the loss. Washington scored five more runs in the seventh off Ryan Pressly, extending their lead to 8\u20132. With a six-run lead, Strasburg was removed before the bottom of the seventh, having held the Astros to two runs on seven hits while striking out seven. In the eighth inning, a two-run home run by Adam Eaton plus a run batted in (RBI) by Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera extended the Nationals' lead to nine runs. A ninth-inning home run by Michael A. Taylor off Chris Devenski pushed the lead to 12\u20132.

In the second inning, Josh Reddick batted in Carlos Correa as Houston scored the game's first run. In the third inning, Jos\u00e9 Altuve doubled and advanced to third on an error, then scored on an infield single by Michael Brantley, giving the Astros a 2\u20130 lead. The Nationals loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the third, but were unable to score. In the bottom of the fourth, Ryan Zimmerman walked then was driven in by a triple by V\u00edctor Robles, cutting the Astros' lead to 2\u20131.[48]\n\n\nHouston restored its two-run lead in the top of the fifth, as Altuve doubled and was then batted in by Brantley. Greinke left with two outs in the bottom of the fifth, having allowed one run on seven hits while striking out six batters. The Astros extended their lead to 4\u20131 in the top of the sixth, as Robinson Chirinos hit a home run off the left field foul pole netting. S\u00e1nchez lasted until one out in the top of the sixth, having allowed four runs on 10 hits while striking out four. With no additional scoring through the middle of the ninth, the Astros brought in closer Roberto Osuna to pitch the bottom of the ninth. Osuna allowed a one-out single to Adam Eaton, but otherwise retired the Nationals; Juan Soto struck out looking to end the Nationals\u2019 eight-game playoff winning streak. Osuna earned his second save this postseason, as Houston narrowed Washington's lead in the series to 2\u20131. This became the first World Series to begin with three games won by the road team since 1996, when the first five games were won by the road team.[49]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Bregman had five RBIs in Game 4, four on a grand slam.[50]\n\n\nOctober 26, 2019 8:08\u00a0pm (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., 63\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C), overcast\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 13 | 1\n |\n| Washington | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Patrick Corbin (0\u20131)**Home runs:**HOU: Robinson Chirinos (2), Alex Bregman (2)WAS: None**Attendance:** 43,889Boxscore |\n\n\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by a Nationals Youth Baseball Academy scholar-athlete.[51][52] Patrick Corbin started for the Nationals and Jos\u00e9 Urquidy started for the Astros.[53] The Astros scored early, recording two runs in the first inning on four consecutive singles with one out.[54] Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning, extending Houston's lead to 4\u20130.[54] Urquidy exited after five innings, having held the Nationals scoreless, retiring nine straight batters before being removed.[54]\n\n\nWashington scored a run in the bottom of the sixth, coming on a Juan Soto ground out with the bases loaded and one out. Corbin pitched six innings, allowing four runs on seven hits while striking out five. A grand slam by Alex Bregman in the seventh inning extended Houston's lead to 8\u20131.[55] It was the 20th ever World Series grand slam and first since Addison Russell hit one in Game\u00a06 of the 2016 World Series.[56] With no further scoring, the Astros evened the series, 2\u20132, ensuring a sixth game in Houston.

In the top of the fourth, Carlos Correa hit another two-run home run, extending Houston's lead to 4\u20130. Ross pitched for five innings, allowing four runs on five hits while striking out one batter. Juan Soto narrowed the lead to 4\u20131 with a home run in the bottom of the seventh. Yuli Gurriel batted in a run in the top of the eighth to restore the four-run lead. Cole left after seven innings, having held the Nationals to one run on three hits while striking out nine. George Springer's two-run home run in the top of the ninth stretched Houston's lead to 7\u20131. With Ryan Pressly ending the game by allowing no baserunners in the bottom of the ninth, the Astros moved to within a victory of their second title in three years. This became the third World Series\u2014along with 1906 and 1996\u2014to have the road team win the first five games.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. President Donald J. Trump waves to the crowd.\nHome plate umpire Lance Barksdale's strike zone during the game drew attention,[61] with some sports journalists, including Jeff Passan, increasing their appeals to MLB for a computerized strike zone.[62][63] Two women in the crowd flashed their bare chests during the game\u2014briefly visible on television\u2014in an attempt to raise awareness for their website, claiming proceeds from the site \"will be going to women with breast cancer\".[64] Along with a third woman, they were removed from the game and were banned from all MLB stadiums \"indefinitely\".[64] U.S. President Donald Trump was booed and \"chants of 'Lock him up!' broke out in some sections\" when he and wife Melania were introduced after the third inning during the regular serviceperson recognition segment.[65] This led to some discussion in the media of the civility required of the event and the larger political discourse taking place.[66] This was not the first time at a World Series that a President was booed;[67] at the 1931 World Series, taking place during Prohibition, fans in Philadelphia had chanted at Herbert Hoover, \"We want beer!

A sacrifice fly by Jos\u00e9 Altuve and a home run by Alex Bregman in the bottom of the first gave Houston a 2\u20131 lead.[71] Bregman carried his bat to first base after homering, which some media members considered disrespectful.[72] Fifth-inning home runs by Adam Eaton and Juan Soto gave the Nationals a 3\u20132 lead. Soto also carried his bat to first base after homering, mimicking Bregman.[72] Post-game, both managers voiced displeasure with the bat-carrying; Bregman apologized and said he was at fault.[73][74]\n\n\nVerlander exited after five innings, having allowed three runs on five hits while striking out three batters.[75] In the top of the seventh inning, Trea Turner was controversially called out for interference on a play at first base,[76] which Washington manager Dave Martinez furiously took issue with, leading to his ejection.[75] Later that inning, a two-out, two-run home run by Rendon off Will Harris\u2014who had not allowed an earned run in the postseason\u2014increased Washington's lead to 5\u20132.[71] Rendon batted in two more runs in the top of the ninth with a double off Chris Devenski, extending the Nationals' lead to 7\u20132. Strasburg left with one out in the bottom of the ninth, having held the Astros to two runs on five hits while striking out seven.[75] Sean Doolittle relieved Strasburg, and allowed a two-out double to Carlos Correa, but nothing further, and the Nationals evened the series to force a deciding seventh game.[77] This was the first instance in MLB, NBA, or NHL history when the road team won the first six games of a best-of-seven series.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Interference call and Martinez ejection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTrea Turner (left) and umpire Sam Holbrook\n\nIn the top of the seventh inning, the Nationals had a 3\u20132 lead with a runner, Yan Gomes, on first base with no outs when batter Trea Turner hit a swinging bunt to the third base side of the pitcher's mound.[78] Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded the ball and threw it to first base; the ball was not caught by first baseman Yuli Gurriel and rolled into foul territory beyond the base, apparently giving the Nationals runners on second and third with no outs.[78] However, Turner was called out by home plate umpire Sam Holbrook for interference, negating the play and requiring Gomes to return to first base.[78] While initial reports and television commentary indicated the call was for running outside the 45-foot (14\u00a0m) runner's lane,[79] MLB's chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, clarified after the game that Turner had interfered with Gurriel's attempt to catch the ball,[80][81] stating that Turner \"did run to the fair side of the 45-foot line, but really the violation was when he kept Gurriel from being able to catch the ball at first base.\"[78][82] The call led to a delay of nearly 4+1\u20442 minutes while umpires confirmed their interpretation of the rules (the decision itself was a judgment call not reviewable via MLB instant replay).[78] The call was argued by Nationals manager Dave Martinez when it was first made and again, more intensely, during the seventh-inning stretch, resulting in his ejection by Holbrook.[83] It was the first ejection in a World Series since 1996, when Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox had been ejected.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Game 7[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Game 7 Full replay on MLB's official YouTube channel |\n\n\n![](image)Patrick Corbin was the winning pitcher in Game 7.\n\n\nOctober 30, 2019 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Patrick Corbin (1\u20131) \u00a0 **LP:** Will Harris (0\u20131)**Home runs:**WAS: Anthony Rendon (2), Howie Kendrick (1)HOU: Yuli Gurriel (1)**Attendance:** 43,326Boxscore |\n\n\nThis was the 40th time a World Series reached its deciding Game 7.[86][note 7] The starting pitchers were Washington's Max Scherzer, who won Game\u00a01, and Houston's Zack Greinke, who received a no decision in Game\u00a03,[87] making this the first World Series Game\u00a07 started by two previous Cy Young Award winners.[88] Ceremonial first pitches were thrown by former Astros Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio.[89]\n\n\nA home run by Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second inning gave the Astros an early 1\u20130 lead. Carlos Correa hit a two-out RBI single in the bottom of the fifth inning to extend the lead to 2\u20130. Scherzer pitched five innings, allowing two runs on seven hits while striking out three batters. Greinke had given up only one hit (a single) before Anthony Rendon's home run in the top of the seventh cut the Astros' lead to 2\u20131. Greinke walked Soto after Rendon's homer and was then replaced by Will Harris. Harris gave up a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick off the right field foul pole, giving the Nationals a 3\u20132 lead, which they never relinquished. Greinke was charged with two runs on two hits while striking out three in 6+1\u20443 innings.[90] Roberto Osuna pitched the eighth inning for Houston, when Juan Soto batted in Adam Eaton with two outs to give Washington a two-run lead.[91][92] The Nationals extended their lead to 6\u20132 in the ninth inning, with two runs scoring on a one-out single by Eaton with the bases loaded. With Patrick Corbin having pitched three scoreless innings in relief for Washington, Daniel Hudson came in to pitch the bottom of the ninth and retired the side in order, as Michael Brantley struck out swinging to end the game, series, and baseball season, giving the Nationals franchise its first World Series title in 51 seasons,[note 8] and the city's first since the Senators won in 1924.[90]\n\n\nThe Nationals' win marked the sixth straight year that a team clinched the World Series title via a win on the road,[note 9] including four times that a Game\u00a07 was won by the visiting team.[93] For the first time in major North American sports history, the visiting team won all seven games of a best-of-seven postseason series.[94][95] In championship series of the NBA, NHL, and MLB contested during 2019, road teams compiled an overall 17\u20133 record.[note 10] Additionally, the Nationals became the first team to win the World Series in their first appearance since 2002, when the Anaheim Angels accomplished the feat by defeating the San Francisco Giants in seven games.[98] During postgame ceremonies, Washington's Stephen Strasburg was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first time a former No. 1 overall draft pick earned the award,[4][99] and the first time a pitcher had won the award since Madison Bumgarner had won in 2014.\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n2019 World Series (4\u20133): **Washington Nationals** (NL) defeated Houston Astros (AL).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington Nationals** | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 12 | 4 | 5 | 33 | 58 | 4\n |\n| Houston Astros | 8 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 30 | 68 | 3\n |\n| **Home runs:**WAS: Juan Soto (3), Adam Eaton (2), Anthony Rendon (2), Howie Kendrick (1), Kurt Suzuki (1), Michael A.

(31.8/53) markets, making it the most-viewed MLB game in Washington since 1998.[117]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio broadcast the World Series for the 22nd straight year,[118] with coverage presented by AutoZone. Dan Shulman served as play-by-play announcer, with Chris Singleton as color commentator and Buster Olney as field reporter. Marc Kestecher and Kevin Winter hosted the pregame shows with reporter Tim Kurkjian.[119] New Spanish-language radio network Unanimo Deportes, flagshipped at WMYM Miami, broadcast its first World Series with Beto Ferreiro and Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez announcing.[120]\n\n\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers. In Houston, KBME aired the series with Robert Ford and Steve Sparks announcing. In Washington, WJFK-FM aired the series with Charlie Slowes and Dave Jageler calling the games. Per MLB rules, the teams' other radio affiliates may carry the series but must air the ESPN Radio broadcast.[104]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Astros[edit]\n\n\nSpeculation about sign stealing by the Astros had been rampant for a number of years. After being knocked out by the Nationals in the National League Division Series, several Dodgers (the team the Astros beat in the 2017 World Series) reached out to Washington Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier, who had been with Los Angeles the previous year, to warn him that Houston was elaborately stealing signs. Many American League clubs also reached out to Washington to say the same as well.[121]\n\n\nShortly after the 2019 World Series concluded, on November 12, 2019, journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich published a story in *The Athletic* detailing for the first time specific allegations that the Astros had engaged in illicit electronic sign stealing. MLB launched an investigation and found evidence that the Astros did engage in illegal electronic sign stealing in 2017 and 2018, but found no evidence that they used the scheme in 2019.\n\n\nAfter losing the 2019 World Series, the Astros have continued to be a top team, coming within one win of making the World Series in the shortened 2020 season and returning to the World Series in 2021, which they lost to the Atlanta Braves, and in 2022, when they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies. They were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, in which the visiting team won all seven games.\n\n\n\n### Nationals[edit]\n\n\nThe Nationals, however, quickly lost many players from their championship team and fell to the bottom of the league. The Nationals let all-star third baseman Anthony Rendon leave in free agency to the Los Angeles Angels in the offseason (the Angels also signed 2019 Nationals part-time catcher Kurt Suzuki). The COVID-19 pandemic kept the Nationals from properly celebrating their 2019 championship the following season, as spectators were not allowed in the stands during the shortened season. They raised their championship banner in front of an empty Nationals Park on the first day of the 2020 season, and received their championship rings in the clubhouse rather than on the field in front of the fans.[122] The Nationals finished tied for last in the NL East in 2020. Postseason hero Howie Kendrick retired at the end of the season.\n\n\nStruggling at the trade deadline in 2021, the Nationals engaged in a large-scale selloff of top players who had led them to the championship.[123] The Nationals became the first team to trade three players who were All-Stars before the end of the season, which included starting pitcher Max Scherzer, outfielder Kyle Schwarber, and shortstop Trea Turner. They also traded off important pieces from their World Series team, such as catcher Yan Gomes and reliever Daniel Hudson.[124] By the end of 2021, only a handful of players from the 2019 championship team were still with the club.\n\n\nThe Nationals rotation that many saw as the team's strength during their World Series run was not as effective going forward. Scherzer, although still dominant, struggled with lower body injuries until he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the 2021 trade deadline.[125] Patrick Corbin led the National League is losses and earned runs given up in 2021 and 2022. Anibal Sanchez struggled mighty during the 2020 season so much that he spent the 2021 season out of baseball entirely, only to return to Washington in 2022. Lastly, Stephen Strasburg, Washington's MVP of the 2019 World Series, was rewarded with a lucrative seven-year contract with the Nationals after the World Series.[126] Unfortunately, Strasburg suffered many injuries, and he only made a combined eight starts from 2020 to 2023.\n\n\nBy 2022, the Lerner family were reporting exploring a sale of the Nationals.[127] Later that year at the trade deadline, the team traded superstar Juan Soto, after he rejected a reported 14-year extension,[128] to San Diego for young players and prospects.[129] Before the start of the 2023 season, patriarch Ted Lerner died at the age of 97. \n\n\nBecause of the trades at the 2021-2022 trade deadlines, the Nationals were surprisingly competitive for much of 2023, despite fielding one of the youngest rosters in baseball.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2019 Japan Series\n* 2019 Korean Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** During the postseason, there are seven umpires to a crew.

The 116th World Series was a best-of-seven-playoff between the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers defeated the Rays to win the series in six games for their first championship since 1988.\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, from October 20 to October 27 with the ballpark's seating capacity limited to 25 percent (11,500 fans). The pandemic resulted in the regular season being reduced to 60 games, and the postseason being held at neutral sites instead of at teams' home stadiums. Thus, this was the first World Series to be played at a neutral site, as well as the first since 1944 to be held at only one ballpark and the first since 1993 to be played entirely on artificial turf. It was also the first World Series since 1984 to use the designated hitter for all games.[2][3] With 2020 being the inaugural season for Globe Life Field, it became the first ballpark to host the World Series in its first year since Yankee Stadium in 2009.\n\n\nDespite not playing on their home field, the Dodgers were still designated as having home-field advantage in the series with the better regular season record. Los Angeles and Tampa Bay alternated victories during the first four games of the series before the Dodgers won both Game 5 and 6, becoming the first designated home team to win the World Series since the 2013 edition. Los Angeles shortstop Corey Seager was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs, five runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .556.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Major League Baseball postseason\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Major League Baseball season \u00a7\u00a0Schedule\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Major League Baseball (MLB) and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) agreed to shorten the standard 162-game season to 60 games, the shortest since 1878. They also agreed to hold an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for only the 2020 season. In addition to each league's three division winners, each league's three division runners-up qualified, and two additional wild card teams per league qualified based on win\u2013loss record. The first round was the Wild Card Series, a best-of-three playoff hosted by the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason maintained its standard format of a best-of-five League Division Series, best-of-seven League Championship Series, and the best-of-seven World Series.[5][6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Globe Life Field\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRays manager Kevin Cash (top) and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts\n\nAfter COVID-19 outbreaks among several teams resulted in the postponement of about 40 regular season games, MLB and the MLBPA agreed to hold the division series, league championships, and World Series in protective \"bubble\" environments at neutral sites to limit the chances of experiencing another outbreak. MLB chose Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, as the site of the 2020 World Series.[7] The Texas Rangers, who play their home games at Globe Life Field, failed to qualify for the postseason.[8] It was the first time since the 1944 World Series (played between the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns, who shared Sportsman's Park as their home field) that the entire series was held at one ballpark.[9]\n\n\nWhile fans were not permitted to attend MLB games during the 2020 season, Commissioner Rob Manfred expressed his hope that fans would be able to attend the World Series in a limited capacity.[10] On September 30, MLB announced that fans would be able to attend the NLCS and World Series at 25% capacity, allowing a maximum of 11,500 people to attend each game at Globe Life Field.[11] Both teams stayed at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas as the designated bubble hotel.[12]\n\n\n\n### Tampa Bay Rays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Tampa Bay Rays season\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays of the American League made their second appearance in the World Series in franchise history and their first since 2008. They finished the shortened regular season with a 40\u201320 (.667) record, the best in the American League. They then swept the Toronto Blue Jays in two games in the Wild Card Series, defeated the New York Yankees in five games in the Division Series, and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games after leading 3\u20130 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).[13][14] Randy Arozarena hit seven home runs in 14 postseason games prior to the World Series, becoming the first rookie position player to ever win the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award. After his performance in the World Series, Arozarena would break records in home runs, hits, and total bases in a single postseason.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League made their 21st appearance in the World Series, passing the Giants for most all-time in the National League, and third in four years, having lost in 2017 and 2018.[17] Prior to the 2020 season, the Dodgers traded outfielder Alex Verdugo and minor leaguers Connor Wong and Jeter Downs to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for outfielder Mookie Betts, starting pitcher David Price and cash considerations.[15] The Dodgers finished the shortened regular season with a 43\u201317 (.717) record, the best in all of MLB.[18] Betts finished the 2020 60 game regular-season hitting .292/.366/.562 with 47 runs (fourth in the NL), 16 home runs (third), 39 RBIs, a .928 OPS, and 10 stolen bases.[19]\n\n\nThe Dodgers swept both the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the Division Series, before defeating the Atlanta Braves in seven games in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) after trailing 3\u20131 in that series.[20] In the NLCS, Betts made three straight series saving defensive gems in elimination games for the Dodgers as they were the fourteenth team in MLB history to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit.[19]\n\n\n\n### Series notes[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020 season rule change, calling for each extra half-inning to begin with a runner on second base, was not implemented for any postseason round, including the World Series.[21]\n\n\nThis was the fourth time in the Wild Card era when both teams with the best record in each league faced each other in the World Series.[22] This had previously occurred in 1995, 1999, and 2013. Additionally, the Dodgers and Rays combined for a .692 winning percentage in the regular season, the highest combined regular-season winning percentage for a World Series matchup ever, surpassing the 1906 World Series between the Cubs and White Sox (.690).[23]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series to feature two cities that held either the NBA or the NHL title the same year, as the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2020 NBA Finals on October 11 and the Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals on September 28.[24] With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers qualifying and eventually winning Super Bowl LV the following winter, Tampa's NHL, MLB and NFL teams all made the championship round within a six-month span.[25]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series since 1993 to have all games played on artificial turf.[26]\n\n\nAndrew Friedman, the Dodgers President of Baseball Operations, was the Rays general manager from 2004 to 2014. Under Friedman's tenure as general manager the Rays saw their first run of success as a franchise, which was highlighted by a World Series appearance in 2008 and five 90-win seasons from 2008 to 2013. The 2020 Rays had only five players that were originally acquired by Freidman: Kevin Kiermaier (drafted in 2010) Blake Snell (drafted in 2011), Jos\u00e9 Alvarado (signed as an International amateur in 2012), Diego Castillo (signed as an International amateur in 2014), and Willy Adames (traded for in 2014). Only Alvarado was not on Tampa's World Series roster. Current Rays GM Erik Neander also received his start in baseball under Friedman in 2007 as an intern.[27] Other connections between the two teams included Brandon Gomes, the current Dodgers Vice President & Assistant General Manager, who was a Rays middle relief pitcher from 2011 to 2015; and Joel Peralta, the current Dodgers Special Assistant, Baseball Operations, who was a popular Rays reliever from 2011 to 2014.[28] Dodgers relievers Adam Kolarek was also a member of the Rays from 2017 to 2019, while Dylan Floro pitched briefly for Tampa Bay in 2016.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Los Angeles won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 20 | Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 3, **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 8 | Globe Life Field | 3:24 | 11,388[29] |\n| 2 | October 21 | **Tampa Bay Rays** \u2013 6, Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 4 | Globe Life Field | 3:40 | 11,472[30] |\n| 3 | October 23 | **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 6, Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 2 | Globe Life Field | 3:14 | 11,447[31] |\n| 4 | October 24 | Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 7, **Tampa Bay Rays** \u2013 8 | Globe Life Field | 4:10 | 11,441[32] |\n| 5 | October 25 | **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 4, Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 2 | Globe Life Field | 3:30 | 11,437[33] |\n| 6 | October 27 | Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 1, **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 3 | Globe Life Field | 3:28 | 11,437[34] |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Game 1 winning pitcher Clayton Kershaw\n\n\nOctober 20, 2020 7:11\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tampa Bay | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **Los Angeles** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 | X | 8 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Clayton Kershaw (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Tyler Glasnow (0\u20131)**Home runs:**TB: Kevin Kiermaier (1)LAD: Cody Bellinger (1), Mookie Betts (1)**Attendance:** 11,388Boxscore |\n\n\nFor the pregame ceremony, Pentatonix performed the national anthem and four first responders threw out ceremonial first pitches.[35]\n\n\nCody Bellinger hit a two-run home run off Tyler Glasnow in the fourth inning for the first runs of the series.[36] Kevin Kiermaier reduced the Tampa Bay deficit to one run with a solo home run in the fifth inning. The Dodgers scored four runs in the fifth inning on a run batted in (RBI) fielder's choice by Max Muncy, followed by RBI singles by Will Smith, Chris Taylor, and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez. Glasnow finished with six runs allowed (all earned) in 41\u20443 innings on three hits and six walks, with eight strikeouts. Betts homered off Josh Fleming in the sixth inning. Muncy then doubled home Justin Turner for another run. Clayton Kershaw came out of the game after the sixth inning, having only allowed two hits (one of them the solo homer) and one walk while striking out eight. The Rays scored two runs in the seventh inning, when Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs off reliever Victor Gonz\u00e1lez. The Dodgers held on to win 8\u20133.[37]\n\n\nThe Dodgers tied several postseason records in Game 1. Kershaw's 11th postseason start tied Greg Maddux for second-most in MLB history,[38] and he recorded his 200th postseason strikeout in the fifth inning, surpassing John Smoltz for second-most all time.[39] The Dodgers as a team tied the New York Giants (1912) for most stolen bases in a single World Series inning, with three.[40]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brandon Lowe had two hits and three RBIs in Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 21, 2020 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tampa Bay** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Los Angeles | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Nick Anderson (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Tony Gonsolin (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Diego Castillo (1)**Home runs:**TB: Brandon Lowe 2 (2)LAD: Chris Taylor (1), Will Smith (1), Corey Seager (1)**Attendance:** 11,472Boxscore |\n\n\nFollowing Game 1, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced that Tony Gonsolin would start Game 2.[41] Blake Snell started for the Rays.[42] Brandon Lowe hit a solo homer off Gonsolin in the first inning to give the Rays their first lead of the series. Gonsolin allowed no other hits or runs and left after 1+1\u20443 innings, the shortest start in the World Series since Jake Peavy in 2014. Joey Wendle doubled in two runs off Dustin May in the fourth inning to extend the Rays' lead to three. The teams traded two-run homers in the fifth inning, with Lowe hitting his second of the night, this time off May, and Chris Taylor, whose home run off Snell was the Dodgers' first hit of the game. Snell pitched 4+2\u20443 innings and allowed two hits and four walks while striking out nine. A sacrifice fly by Wendle off Joe Kelly in the sixth added another run for the Rays and Will Smith homered off Nick Anderson in the bottom of the inning for the Dodgers. Corey Seager hit a home run in the eighth inning off Pete Fairbanks to close the gap to two, and set a new postseason record for most home runs by a shortstop (seven). The Rays held on to even the series with a 6\u20134 win. The Dodgers struck out 15 times in the game, tying the World Series franchise record set in the 18-inning third game of the 2018 World Series.[43] Ji-man Choi became the first Korean-born player to record a hit in the World Series.[44]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Game 3 winning pitcher Walker Buehler\n\n\nOctober 23, 2020 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Los Angeles** | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Tampa Bay | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Walker Buehler (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Charlie Morton (0\u20131)**Home runs:**LAD: Justin Turner (1), Austin Barnes (1)TB: Randy Arozarena (1)**Attendance:** 11,447Boxscore |\n\n\nWalker Buehler started Game 3 for the Dodgers,[45] and the Rays countered with Charlie Morton.[46] Justin Turner hit a solo home run off Morton in the first inning for the first run of the game. In doing so, he tied Duke Snider for the most postseason home runs in Dodgers franchise history with 11.[47] Max Muncy drove in two runs with a single in the third inning and the Dodgers set a new record for the most runs scored with two outs in a single postseason with 48. The Dodgers scored two more runs in the fourth inning on a safety squeeze by Austin Barnes and an RBI single by Mookie Betts. Morton was removed from the game after 4+1\u20443 innings; he allowed five runs on seven hits and one walk while striking out six.[48]\n\n\nA double by Willy Adames in the fifth inning gave the Rays their first run. Barnes hit a solo home run off John Curtiss in the sixth inning for the Dodgers,[48] becoming the first player since H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez in 1961 to have both a squeeze bunt and a homer in the same World Series game.[49] Buehler pitched six innings and allowed one run on three hits and one walk with 10 strikeouts, becoming the third-youngest pitcher with 10 or more strikeouts and three or fewer hits in a World Series game, behind only Ed Walsh in 1906 and Josh Beckett in 2003.[50] Randy Arozarena hit a solo home run for Tampa Bay in the bottom of the ninth inning off Kenley Jansen, to give him a record-tying eight home runs and a record setting 23 hits in the postseason,[51] but the Dodgers held on to win 6\u20132 to take a 2\u20131 lead in the series.[48]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brett Phillips (pictured with the Omaha Storm Chasers) recorded the game-winning single for the Rays in Game 4.\n\n\nOctober 24, 2020 7:09\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 57\u00a0\u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 15 | 2\n |\n| **Tampa Bay** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 8 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** John Curtiss (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Kenley Jansen (0\u20131)**Home runs:**LAD: Justin Turner (2), Corey Seager (2)TB: Randy Arozarena (2), Hunter Renfroe (1), Brandon Lowe (3), Kevin Kiermaier (2)**Attendance:** 11,441Boxscore |\n\n\nIn Game 4, Julio Ur\u00edas started for Los Angeles[52] and Ryan Yarbrough for Tampa Bay.[53] For the second game in a row, Justin Turner hit a solo home run in the first inning. With that, he passed Duke Snider for most postseason home runs in franchise history[54] and became the first player in MLB history to homer in the first inning of back-to-back World Series games.[55] Corey Seager hit a solo home run in the third, for his eighth of the postseason, tying for the most all-time in a single postseason with Randy Arozarena, Barry Bonds, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, and Nelson Cruz.[56] Yarbrough pitched 3+1\u20443 innings with two runs allowed on five hits and one walk. Arozarena hit another home run leading off the bottom of the fourth inning, for his ninth of the postseason and sole possession of the record. Muncy hit an RBI single off Fairbanks to score Seager in the fifth inning. Hunter Renfroe hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to return the lead to one run. Ur\u00edas pitched 4+2\u20443 innings, allowing two runs on four hits and one walk with eight strikeouts. The Dodgers scored again in the sixth inning on an RBI single by Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez against Diego Castillo. A three-run home run by Lowe, his third of the series, off Pedro B\u00e1ez in the bottom of the inning gave the Rays their first lead of the game. Joc Pederson drove in two runs with a pinch hit single in the seventh inning off Nick Anderson to put the Dodgers back ahead. Kevin Kiermaier hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning off B\u00e1ez to tie the game. Seager, with his fourth hit of the game, drove in Chris Taylor on a single in the eighth against Anderson to put the Dodgers back up again.[57]\n\n\nWith two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down in the count 1\u20132, Brett Phillips singled off Kenley Jansen for his first career postseason hit. As Kiermaier scored to tie the game, Taylor misfielded the ball in center field. As Arozarena rounded third base, he fell and began to head back to third base after getting back on his feet. With Muncy cutting off the throw from the outfield, his relay throw to Will Smith went off of Smith's mitt, allowing Arozarena to dive in safely at home to give the Rays an 8\u20137 win and tie the series at two.[57] It was the first World Series game to end on an error since Game 6 of the 1986 World Series and Jansen was credited with his record fourth blown save in World Series appearances.[58] Phillips also became the first player since Kirk Gibson in the 1988 World Series to get a game-winning hit with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max Muncy was 2-for-3 including a home run in Game 5.\n\n\nOctober 25, 2020 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Los Angeles** | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 1\n |\n| Tampa Bay | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Clayton Kershaw (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Tyler Glasnow (0\u20132) \u00a0 **Sv:** Blake Treinen (1)**Home runs:**LAD: Joc Pederson (1), Max Muncy (1)TB: None**Attendance:** 11,437Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 5 featured a rematch of Game 1 starting pitchers; Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and Tyler Glasnow for the Rays.[59] This was Kershaw's sixth World Series start, tying him for second most all-time in Dodgers franchise history behind Sandy Koufax and Carl Erskine.[60] The Dodgers got the early lead again in this game, with Betts doubling to start the game and being driven in by a single by Seager, who advanced to second and third on wild pitches, and then scored on an infield hit by Cody Bellinger. Pederson hit a solo home run in the second to extend the Dodgers' lead to three. An RBI triple by Yandy D\u00edaz drove in the Rays' first run in the third inning. D\u00edaz then scored on a single by Arozarena, who collected his 27th hit, the most in a single postseason.[61]\nIn the bottom of the fourth inning, Manuel Margot walked, stole second, and advanced to third on an error; he attempted to steal home with two outs, but was tagged out at the plate on a throw from Kershaw to catcher Austin Barnes.[62] Charley Steiner, long-time Dodgers' radio announcer, pointed out that with the stands near the field mostly empty, Kershaw could hear his teammates in the dugout with the early warning.[63]\n\n\nMuncy hit a solo homer in the fifth inning as the Dodgers set a new major league record for different players on the same team hitting a home run in a postseason series, with nine.[64] Glasnow pitched five innings (the first Rays starter to do so in the series), allowing four runs on six hits and three walks with seven strikeouts. Kershaw's strikeout of Kiermaier in the bottom of the fifth inning moved him past Justin Verlander for the record of most career postseason strikeouts. He finished with 5+2\u20443 innings pitched, two runs allowed on five hits, and two walks with six strikeouts. The bullpens held the game scoreless the rest of the way and the Dodgers won 4\u20132 to regain the series lead.[65]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mookie Betts (pictured with the Red Sox) ran in the go-ahead score and had a home run to clinch the World Series for the Dodgers.\n\n\nOctober 27, 2020 7:09\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tampa Bay | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Los Angeles** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | X | 3 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Victor Gonzalez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Nick Anderson (1\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Julio Ur\u00edas (1)**Home runs:**TB: Randy Arozarena (3)LAD: Mookie Betts (2)**Attendance:** 11,437Boxscore |\n\n\nFacing elimination, the Rays started Blake Snell, who had a no decision in Game 2.[66] The Dodgers countered with Tony Gonsolin,[67] who allowed one run as an opener in Game 2 and took the loss. The Rays scored first with a solo home run by Randy Arozarena, his tenth during the postseason and third of the World Series, extending the record he broke back in Game 4. No other player had hit more than eight homers in a single postseason, and Arozarena was also the Rays' career postseason home run leader after just his first year with the team.[68] Gonsolin faced 10 batters in his second start, lasting 1+2\u20443 innings while allowing Arozarena's home run plus two hits and two walks. After Snell allowed a hit to Austin Barnes with one out in the bottom of the sixth inning, Rays manager Kevin Cash controversially decided to remove Snell from the game, who allowed only two hits throwing 73 pitches while striking out nine and walking none in 5+1\u20443 innings. Cash brought in reliever Nick Anderson, who gave up a double to Mookie Betts before throwing a wild pitch with Corey Seager at bat that allowed Barnes to score the tying run. The Dodgers then took the lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Seager that scored Betts. The Dodgers added another run in the eighth inning when Betts hit a home run off Pete Fairbanks. Julio Ur\u00edas pitched the last 2+1\u20443 innings for the save, closing out the series by striking out Willy Adames looking, as the Dodgers won their seventh World Series championship and their first since 1988.[69] This was the first World Series since 2013, where what was considered the \"home team\" won in what was considered \"home field.\"\n\n\nPostgame, Seager was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He was the eighth player\u2014and the first since Madison Bumgarner in 2014\u2014to be named MVP of both the World Series and League Championship Series in the same season. He batted .328 in the Dodgers' 18 postseason games.[70] It was also announced that Justin Turner was removed in the eighth inning due to a positive COVID-19 test result. Despite tweeting that he was asymptomatic, Turner nevertheless took part in the celebration after the Dodgers had won the game, violating MLB protocols.[71] He was the first player to test positive for the virus during the postseason bubble.[72][73] The next day, Major League Baseball announced that Turner would be under investigation.[74] On November 6, Turner apologized for the incident and received no punishment from Rob Manfred, who admitted that MLB could have handled the situation better.[75]\n\n\nThe Dodgers were the first team since the 2010 San Francisco Giants to win a World Series with fully homegrown rotation starting every postseason game.\n\n\nWith the World Series win, the only team to beat the Dodgers in a series in 2020 was the Rockies, who won two out of three at Dodger Stadium in early September.[76] With the best record in baseball, the Dodgers were also just the seventh team in the Wild Card Era (since 1995) to have at least a share of the best record in baseball and win the World Series, joining the 2018 Red Sox, '16 Cubs, '13 Red Sox, '09 Yankees, '07 Red Sox and '98 Yankees on that list.[77] Because of an expanded 16-team postseason field, the Dodgers' 13 postseason wins were the most in MLB history.[78] This would later be matched by the Texas Rangers in 2023.\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tampa Bay Rays | 2 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 22 | 42 | 0\n |\n| **Los Angeles Dodgers** | 4 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 8 | 7 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 32 | 51 | 4\n |\n| **Home runs:**TB: Randy Arozarena (3), Brandon Lowe (3), Kevin Kiermaier (2), Hunter Renfroe (1)LAD: Mookie Betts (2), Corey Seager (2), Justin Turner (2), Austin Barnes (1), Cody Bellinger (1), Max Muncy (1), Joc Pederson (1), Will Smith (1), Chris Taylor (1)**Total\u00a0attendance:**\u00a068,622\u00a0 \u00a0**Average\u00a0attendance:**\u00a011,437**Winning player's share:** $440,910\u00a0 \u00a0**Losing player's share:** $259,722 |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nFor the 21st straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox.[79] Joe Buck called the games as play-by-play announcer, along with John Smoltz as color analyst and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the network's pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Dontrelle Willis. Due to the pandemic, Fox's pregame and postgame shows all took place in their Los Angeles studios, as opposed to traveling on the road. Fox Deportes aired the series in Spanish, with Rolando Nichols, Edgar Gonzalez, Adrian Garcia Marquez, Carlos Alvarez, and Jaime Motta.[80]\n\n\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Matt Vasgersian providing play-by-play and Buck Martinez as color commentator.[80]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 5.1 | 11 | 9.353 | [81] |\n| 2\n | 5.0 | 11 | 9.184 | [82] |\n| 3\n | 4.3 | 10 | 8.339 | [83] |\n| 4\n | 4.8 | 12 | 9.563 | [84] |\n| 5\n | 5.3 | 11 | 10.288 | [85] |\n| 6\n | 6.8 | 15 | 12.819 | [86] |\n\n\nGame 1 was the least-watched World Series game ever, in terms of number of viewers, per Nielsen Media Research records dating back to 1968; it was also the first World Series game to draw less than 10\u00a0million viewers since Game 3 in 2008, which underwent a 90-minute rain delay.[87] Games 2 and 3 subsequently established new lows.[88] and the average of 9.785\u00a0million viewers per game set a new World Series low.[86]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio broadcast the series in the United States, with Dan Shulman on play-by-play, Chris Singleton and Jessica Mendoza as color analysts, Buster Olney as reporter, and Marc Kestecher hosting the pregame shows. Mendoza became the first woman to serve as a game analyst on a national World Series broadcast. Shulman, Singleton, and Mendoza called the games from ESPN's studios in Bristol, Connecticut due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[89]\nThe flagship radio stations for each team broadcast the games locally with their own announcers: WDAE (in English) and WGES (in Spanish) for Tampa Bay; and KLAC (in English), KTNQ (in Spanish), and KMPC (in Korean) for Los Angeles.[80]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMinutes after the final out, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles City Hall, L.A. Live, the Santa Monica Pier and many other Los Angeles landmarks lit up blue to celebrate the Dodgers' World Series championship.[90] Retired Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, the voice of the Dodgers from 1950 to 2016, congratulated his former team on Twitter and it was announced a few days later that Scully would narrate the team's year-end championship documentary.[91][92] The 2020 championship was the final Dodgers' title Scully was able to witness until his death in August 2022.\n\n\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris with the Los Angeles DodgersWith the Lakers having won the NBA Finals, Los Angeles repeated its achievement of having NBA and World Series champions in the same year, as both the Lakers and Dodgers had won in 1988.[93] In fact, just 16 days had passed between the Lakers and Dodgers championship wins, which was the shortest timespan for two championships in the same city. 16 months later, the Los Angeles Rams would win Super Bowl LVI over the Cincinnati Bengals, and to follow it up 8 months after that the LAFC went on to win the 2022 MLS Cup in a penalty shootout by defeating the Philadelphia Union, meaning Los Angeles would be the first city to celebrate NBA, MLB, NFL, and MLS championships within a two-year span.[94]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti advised fans not to gather for large celebrations. Nevertheless, many fans took to the streets of Los Angeles, lighting off fireworks and taking over street intersections, in areas such as Pico Boulevard, Broadway and Figueroa Street before being dispersed by police.[95] The day after the World Series, the Dodgers released a statement regarding a public victory parade, stating any celebration would be postponed.[96] In lieu of a rally, the Dodgers set up a drive-through holiday festival event. The event, which was held from November 27 through January 3, featured a light show, LED video displays, fake snow and interactive displays honoring the Dodgers World Championship and celebrating the holidays. When the Dodgers went to go face the Washington Nationals in July 2021, the team visited the White House and President Joe Biden to honor, and celebrate their World Series victory.[97][98]\n\n\nLos Angeles would lose core members to their 2020 championship core over the next few seasons, losing Joc Pederson and Kik\u00e9 Hernandez in free agency in 2020, Corey Seager and Kenley Jansen in free agency in 2021, Justin Turner in free agency in 2022, and non-tendering Cody Bellinger in 2022. Younger members of the team would also experience serious injuries, such as Walker Buehler, Tony Gonsolin, and Dustin May undergoing Tommy John surgery, and Gavin Lux losing a season due to a broken leg. Because of this, the Dodgers once vaulted depth would suffer. They would remain an excellent regular season team, but were upset each of the next three seasons. In postseason appearances in 2022 and 2023, they would hit under .200 as a team.\n\n\n\n### Rays[edit]\n\n\nKevin Cash would receive tremendous backlash for his decision to remove Blake Snell after just 73 pitches in the sixth inning of Game 6.[99] Cash defended his decision, stating he did not want Snell going through the Dodgers order a third time, even despite his dominance for 5+1\u20443 innings. Yahoo Sports immediately named it one of the worst decisions in World Series history, while Deadspin called it the third worst in World Series history.[100] FOX Sports post-game analyst and former big leaguer Alex Rodriguez said it was the worst decision he had ever seen in baseball.[101] Upon his removal, opposing manager Dave Roberts said during postgame, \"Mookie looked at me with a little smile. We were all just excited that Snell was out of the game.\"[102] Cash's decision sparked a discussion in whether modern managers were using too much sabermetrics and statistical analysis when making decisions rather than going with their instincts.[103][104][105] Some noted that while the decision was controversial, the Rays offense had only scored one run and the Dodgers, who hit starters remarkably better the third time through the order, had not been shut out all season.[106][107] Cash had also managed his starters with a short leash the whole season. In a similar move, Cash pulled Charlie Morton from Game 7 of the ALCS at 66 pitches, even though Morton only allowed 2 hits and no runs through for 5+2\u20443.[108]\n\n\nFollowing their series loss, Tampa Bay placed Blake Snell on the trade block and later sent him to the San Diego Padres for a major-league catcher and three minor-league prospects.[109] Veteran pitcher Charlie Morton signed with the Atlanta Braves as a free agent after his club option was declined.[110] Morton would win a World Series with Atlanta the next season, which was the second of his career.\n\n\nA film based on Randy Arozarena's life is currently scheduled to be released between 2022 and 2023.[111] Arozarena broke the record for home runs in a single postseason with ten, including three home runs in the World Series.[112] Arozarena confirmed in 2023 the film had fallen through.[113]\n\n\nDespite continuing their success in the regular season, having their first 100-win season in 2021 and making the postseason as a wild card in 2022 and 2023, the Rays have not won a postseason series since beating the Astros in the ALCS in 2020.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2020 Japan Series\n* 2020 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Series umpires announced\". *MLB.com* (Press release).

The 117th World Series was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros. The series began on October 26 and concluded on November 2.\n\n\nThe Braves won the series four games to two. It was their fourth World Series title in franchise history, their first since 1995, and their second since the franchise's relocation to Atlanta in 1966.\n\n\nThe Braves advanced to the World Series after winning the NL East division title. Atlanta then defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Division Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. The Astros advanced to the World Series after winning the AL West. Houston then defeated the Chicago White Sox in the AL Division Series and the Boston Red Sox in the AL Championship Series.\n\n\nThe Astros had home-field advantage due to their superior regular-season record over that of the Braves. The series was played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and 7 if it was necessary); and the Braves hosting Games 3, 4, and 5. The teams split the first two games, which were played at Minute Maid Park in Houston, and the Braves won Games 3 and 4 at Truist Park in Atlanta to take a 3-1 lead. The Astros won Game 5, returning the series to Houston. The Braves won Game 6 to win the World Series. Jorge Soler was awarded the World Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting .300 in the series with home runs in three of the Braves victories, each time giving them a lead they would never surrender.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThe team with the better regular-season winning percentage, the Houston Astros, had home field advantage in the series, thus hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and would have hosted Game 7 if needed).[2]\n\n\nThe Astros and Braves had previously met in the postseason five times, in the National League Division Series when the Astros competed in the National League.[3] Of those five series, the Braves won three (1997, 1999, and 2001) while the Astros won two (2004 and 2005).[3] The Astros and Braves played in the National League West from 1969-1993.\n\n\nThe teams' jerseys lacked a World Series patch for the first time since 1997, though a patch was on their caps.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManagers Dusty Baker of the Astros (left) and Brian Snitker of the Braves\n\n### Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Atlanta Braves season\n\nThe Atlanta Braves were managed by Brian Snitker, who joined the organization in 1977 and became their manager in 2016.[5] The Braves qualified for the postseason after winning the National League East for the fourth straight season.[6] They played four months with a winning percentage at .500 or below before finally surpassing .500 on August 6, the latest point in a season that an eventual league champion achieved a winning record.[7] In the best-of-five National League Division Series, the third-seeded Braves defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in four games.[8] In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves defeated the defending world champion Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. Left fielder Eddie Rosario was named NLCS MVP after hitting 14-for-25 (.560) with 3 home runs and 9 runs batted in in the series.[9]\n\n\nThis was the Braves' first World Series appearance since 1999, tenth in franchise history, and sixth while in Atlanta.[10] The Braves entered the series with three prior World Series titles, one as the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and one while based in each of their previous cities of Boston (1914) and Milwaukee (1957).[10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Houston Astros season\n\nUnder second-year manager Dusty Baker, the Houston Astros qualified for the postseason as the American League West division winner, having finished atop the division for the fourth time in five seasons.[11] In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the second-seeded Astros defeated the Chicago White Sox in four games.[12] In the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Astros defeated the Boston Red Sox in six games,[13] with designated hitter Yordan \u00c1lvarez named ALCS MVP after batting 12-for-23 (.522) in the series.[14] Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., who missed the ALCS due to a forearm strain suffered during the ALDS, was omitted from Houston's World Series roster due to that injury.[15]\n\n\nBaker became the ninth manager to win both American and National League pennants (having won the latter with the San Francisco Giants in 2002).[16] Baker's gap of 19 years between appearances in the World Series is surpassed only by Bucky Harris, who managed in the 1925 and 1947 editions.[16] At 72 years and 4 months old, Baker became the second-oldest manager in World Series history, the oldest having been Jack McKeon of the Florida Marlins in 2003, who was seven months older.[17] Astros' hitting coach Troy Snitker is the son of Brian Snitker, the Braves manager.[18] As a player, Baker was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1967 and spent seven seasons there.\n\n\nThis was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, having appeared in 2017 and 2019, and fourth overall, having also appeared in 2005 when they represented the National League.[10] Their only prior World Series title came in 2017.[10]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMinute Maid Park (top) and Truist Park\n\n*Atlanta won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 26 | **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 2 | Minute Maid Park | 4:06 | 42,825\u00a0\n |\n| 2 | October 27 | Atlanta Braves \u2013 2, **Houston Astros** \u2013 7 | Minute Maid Park | 3:11 | 42,833\u00a0\n |\n| 3 | October 29 | Houston Astros \u2013 0, **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 2 | Truist Park | 3:24 | 42,898\u00a0\n |\n| 4 | October 30 | Houston Astros \u2013 2, **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 3 | Truist Park | 3:45 | 43,125\u00a0\n |\n| 5 | October 31 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 9, Atlanta Braves \u2013 5 | Truist Park | 4:00 | 43,122\u00a0\n |\n| 6 | November 2 | **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 7, Houston Astros \u2013 0 | Minute Maid Park | 3:22 | 42,868\n |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A.

Jorge Soler led off the World Series with a home run to left field for a 1\u20130 Atlanta lead after the first three pitches; he became the first player ever to lead off a World Series with a home run.[22] A one-out single by Ozzie Albies followed by a double from Austin Riley gave the Braves a 2\u20130 lead. In the bottom of the first, the Astros had the bases loaded with two outs following a single and two walks, but Morton got Kyle Tucker to ground out, ending the threat. Atlanta added a run in the top of the second on two singles, a fly out, and a fielder's choice, making it 3\u20130. Freddie Freeman then singled and Albies beat out an infield grounder, loading the bases with two outs, but Valdez struck out Riley to end the inning. In the top of the third, Eddie Rosario singled, followed by a two-run home run from Adam Duvall, making it 5\u20130 Braves and driving Valdez from the game after 52 pitches.[23]\n\n\nMorton left in the bottom of the third inning with an injury; X-rays later revealed a fibular fracture in his right leg, causing him to miss the remainder of the series.[24] The injury stemmed from a comebacker off the bat of Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second. It was unclear when Morton's leg was fractured; Braves manager Brian Snitker told reporters that X-rays taken in between innings revealed nothing wrong with Morton, though he said Morton's leg was \"stressed.\" Morton threw 16 pitches following the injury, retiring the next three batters he faced and striking out two.[25]\n\n\nA. J. Minter was brought into the game; Michael Brantley hit a one-out double to right, but Minter retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom of the fourth inning, Tucker hit a one-out double, advanced to third when Gurriel singled with one out, and scored on a fielder's choice, making it 5\u20131. In the top of the eighth, after three scoreless innings, Dansby Swanson walked, advanced to third on a single by Soler, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Freeman, extending Atlanta's lead to 6\u20131. In the bottom of the inning, Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit a lead-off triple and then scored on a groundout by Carlos Correa, making the score 6\u20132. In the bottom of the ninth, Atlanta closer Will Smith allowed only one walk, to Aledmys D\u00edaz, as the Braves took a 1\u20130 lead in the series,[26] their first World Series win since Game 2 in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Altuve hit the Astros' first home run of the series in Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 27, 2021 7:09\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Atlanta | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 2\n |\n| **Houston** | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | X | 7 | 9 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Max Fried (0\u20131)**Home runs:**ATL: Travis d'Arnaud (1)HOU: Jos\u00e9 Altuve (1)**Attendance:** 42,833Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore the game, Atlanta added Tucker Davidson to their roster in replacement of the injured Charlie Morton.[27] Giavanni Walker, a petty officer first class in the United States Navy, sang the national anthem, and Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell threw the ceremonial first pitch.[21]\n\n\nMax Fried started for Atlanta while Jos\u00e9 Urquidy started for Houston.[28] In the bottom of the first inning, Jos\u00e9 Altuve doubled, advanced to third on a flyout by Michael Brantley, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Alex Bregman, giving Houston a 1\u20130 lead. In the top of the second, Atlanta tied the game, 1\u20131, via a solo home run to left field by Travis d'Arnaud, coming on a full count with two outs. In the bottom of the second, the Astros hit three consecutive one-out singles, retaking the lead, 2\u20131. With runners on first and second, Mart\u00edn Maldonado delivered a base hit to the outfield, driving in another run. Braves left fielder Eddie Rosario tried to throw out Jos\u00e9 Siri advancing from first to third, but no Braves player was on the base resulting in an error and allowing Siri to score and making it 4\u20131. After Altuve lined out, Brantley singled to make it 5\u20131. In total, the Astros collected four runs on five singles,[29] tying their club record for most hits in an inning in the World Series.[30]\n\n\nWith two outs in the top of the fifth inning, Freddie Freeman delivered an RBI single to left, scoring d'Arnaud and cutting the Astros' lead to 5\u20132. Houston extended their lead to 6\u20132 in the sixth on a fielder's choice that scored Yordan \u00c1lvarez. The final run came in the bottom of the seventh inning, as Altuve homered on the first pitch by Drew Smyly, making it 7\u20132.[31] It was the 22nd home run of Altuve's postseason career, tying him with Bernie Williams for the second-most all-time.[32][a] This was the first victory by the home team in a World Series since 2018.[b]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ian Anderson threw five no-hit innings as Atlanta's starting pitcher in Game 3.\n\n\nOctober 29, 2021 8:12\u00a0pm (EDT) at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia, 49\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C), drizzle\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0\n |\n| **Atlanta** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | X | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Ian Anderson (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Luis Garc\u00eda (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Will Smith (1)**Home runs:**HOU: NoneATL: Travis d'Arnaud (2)**Attendance:** 42,898Boxscore |\n\n\nIn pregame ceremonies, the ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by Hank Aaron Jr.,[33] as his father was honored before the game;[34] the national anthem was performed by Zac Brown.[35] This was the first World Series game ever played at Truist Park,[c] and the first played in Atlanta since 1999. Ian Anderson started for Atlanta while Luis Garc\u00eda started for Houston, marking the first time two rookie pitchers started against each other in a World Series since Justin Verlander and Anthony Reyes opened Game 1 in 2006.[36]\n\n\nAfter two and a half scoreless innings, the Braves scored on an RBI double by Austin Riley that drove in Eddie Rosario in the bottom of the third inning. Garc\u00eda was relieved after 3+2\u20443 innings, having allowed one run on three hits while striking out six batters. Anderson allowed no hits, three walks, and one hit batsman while striking out four in five innings.[37] The Astros remained hitless through seven innings, as A. J. Minter and Luke Jackson did not allow a hit in the sixth or seventh, respectively. Tyler Matzek started the eighth for the Braves and allowed a bloop single to Aledmys D\u00edaz, who was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Siri as a pinch-runner. With two outs, Siri stole second and advanced to third on a throwing error by Travis d'Arnaud, but was left on base as Michael Brantley popped out. In the bottom of the eighth, d'Arnaud hit a solo home run to extend Atlanta's lead to 2\u20130. That home run was the first time home runs were hit in back-to-back games by the same player since Ryan Klesko did so in the 1995 World Series. d'Arnaud became the first catcher to do this since Roy Campanella did so for the Dodgers in the 1955 World Series. Will Smith, Atlanta's closer, pitched in the top of the ninth inning. He allowed a leadoff single to Alex Bregman, then retired the next three batters, giving Atlanta a 2\u20131 lead in the series.[38] The seven-inning no-hit bid by the Atlanta pitching staff was the longest in a World Series game since Jim Lonborg of the Boston Red Sox went 7+2\u20443 innings before allowing a hit in Game 2 of the 1967 World Series.[39][40] This was the first shutout in the World Series since Game 3 of the 2016 World Series.\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jorge Soler's pinch-hit home run was the deciding run of Game 4.\n\n\nOctober 30, 2021 8:11\u00a0pm (EDT) at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia, 53\u00a0\u00b0F (12\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 8 | 0\n |\n| **Atlanta** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | X | 3 | 8 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Tyler Matzek (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Cristian Javier (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Will Smith (2)**Home runs:**HOU: Jos\u00e9 Altuve (2)ATL: Dansby Swanson (1), Jorge Soler (2)**Attendance:** 43,125Boxscore |\n\n\nPrior to the game, the Astros replaced backup catcher Jason Castro on their roster with Garrett Stubbs, due to COVID-19 protocols.[41] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by cancer survivor Elizabeth O\u2019Connor,[42] and the national anthem was performed by Jordan Fisher.[35] Former U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were in attendance.[43] Zack Greinke started for Houston, while Dylan Lee acted as an opener for Atlanta in his first MLB start.[44][45] Greinke was placed eighth in Houston's batting order, the first starting pitcher in a World Series game not to bat ninth since Babe Ruth in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series.[46]\n\n\nIn the top of the first, Lee allowed a hit to Jos\u00e9 Altuve while issuing two walks and recording one strikeout, then was relieved by Kyle Wright.[47] Altuve scored on a ground out by Carlos Correa to give the Astros an early 1\u20130 lead. Altuve hit a solo home run in the top of the fourth to extend Houston's lead to 2\u20130. Greinke exited after four innings, having allowed no runs on four hits while striking out three and walking none.[48] In the bottom of the sixth, Atlanta had runners at first and second with one out, via a double and a walk. Houston reliever Phil Maton entered, struck out Ozzie Albies, and allowed a hit to Austin Riley that scored a run, cutting the lead to 2\u20131. After an intentional walk to Joc Pederson that loaded the bases with two outs, Maton struck out Travis d'Arnaud to end the rally. Back-to-back solo home runs by Dansby Swanson and Jorge Soler off of Cristian Javier with one out in the bottom of the seventh put Atlanta ahead, 3\u20132.[49] After a scoreless eighth inning, Atlanta closer Will Smith entered to pitch the top of the ninth. He retired the side for his second save in two days, as Atlanta took a 3\u20131 lead in the series.[50]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mart\u00edn Maldonado had three runs batted in during Game 5.\n\n\nOctober 31, 2021 8:15\u00a0pm (EDT) at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia, 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 9 | 12 | 0\n |\n| Atlanta | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** A.

Houston scored twice more in the top of the third, coming on an error, walk, double, and ground out, to make it a 4\u20134 tie game. A solo home run by Freddie Freeman in the bottom of the inning put the Braves back ahead, 5\u20134. Both managers brought in relief pitchers during the third inning. The Astros tied the game at 5\u20135 in the fifth inning when Maldonado drew a walk with the bases loaded, and then scored two more runs on a single by Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez to take a 7\u20135 lead. The Astros added a run in the seventh on an RBI single by Maldonado, and a run in the eighth on an RBI single by Carlos Correa, making it 9\u20135. Kendall Graveman pitched the final two innings for Houston, holding the four-run lead as the Astros avoided elimination and sent the series back to Houston.[53]\n\n\nZack Greinke singled for Houston in the fourth inning as a pinch hitter, becoming the first pitcher with a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in 1923.[54] Game 5 of the 2021 World Series marked the last game to date in which the designated hitter rule was not used. Starting in 2022, the National League added the DH permanently.[55] This makes Greinke the last pitcher to date to get a hit in the postseason (pitchers such as Shohei Ohtani have since gotten hits in the regular season). Additionally, Freeman's home run in this game is the furthest-hit home run in the World Series since the beginning of distance tracking in 2015, at 460 feet.[56]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max Fried pitched six scoreless innings in Game 6 and earned the win.\n\n\nNovember 2, 2021 7:10\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 72\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Atlanta** | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 1\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Max Fried (1\u20131) \u00a0 **LP:** Luis Garc\u00eda (0\u20132)**Home runs:**ATL: Jorge Soler (3), Dansby Swanson (2), Freddie Freeman (2)HOU: None**Attendance:** 42,868Boxscore |\n\n\nA \"Rally Nun\"[d] threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and country music artist Carly Pearce sang the national anthem.[59] Before the game, Johan Camargo replaced Ehire Adrianza on the Braves' roster as Adrianza was placed on the paternity list.[60] Luis Garc\u00eda started for Houston and Max Fried started for Atlanta. The Braves took a 3\u20130 lead in the top of the third inning on a single and walk followed by a towering two-out home run by Jorge Soler that left Minute Maid Park over the raised train tracks in left field.[61] Garcia exited after Soler's home run, having pitched 2+2\u20443 innings while striking out three batters. In the top of the fifth, a two-run home run by Dansby Swanson followed by a walk then a two-out double by Freddie Freeman extended Atlanta's lead to 6\u20130. In the top of the seventh, Freeman hit a solo home run with two outs to make it 7\u20130. Tyler Matzek entered in relief in the bottom of the seventh; Fried allowed no runs on four hits while striking out six batters and walking none in six innings. Atlanta closer Will Smith was brought in to pitch the bottom of the ninth. He allowed a leadoff single to Michael Brantley and retired the next three batters, the last out being a Yuli Gurriel infield grounder fielded by Swanson, who threw to Freeman, giving the Braves the title.[62] With this final inning, Will Smith finished off a postseason in which he closed 11 of 16 Braves games while allowing no runs. Jorge Soler won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[63]\n\n\nWith the World Series victory, Joc Pederson became a back-to-back World Series winner on two different teams, joining names like Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist who previously accomplished that feat.[64] Pederson had become a fan-favorite throughout his three-month stay in Atlanta, particularly for his preference to wear pearls.[65]\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n2021 World Series (4\u20132): **Atlanta Braves** beat Houston Astros.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Atlanta Braves** | 6 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 4 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 25 | 48 | 7\n |\n| Houston Astros | 2 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 20 | 45 | 1\n |\n| **Home runs:**ATL: Jorge Soler (3), Travis d'Arnaud (2), Adam Duvall (2), Freddie Freeman (2), Dansby Swanson (2)HOU: Jos\u00e9 Altuve (2)**Total\u00a0attendance:**\u00a0257,671\u00a0 \u00a0**Average\u00a0attendance:**\u00a042,945**Winning player's share:** $397,331\u00a0 \u00a0**Losing player's share:** $258,373 |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Smoltz, color analyst for Fox\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nFor the 22nd straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox. Joe Buck called the games as a play-by-play announcer, along with Hall of Famer and former Braves pitcher John Smoltz as color analyst and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters.[66] Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Dontrelle Willis.[66] Game 6 was the final Major League Baseball game that Buck called on Fox and one of the final major sporting events he called on the network (his final broadcast on Fox was the 2021 NFC Championship Game).\n\n\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Scott Braun providing play-by-play and Dan Plesac as color commentator.[67] The MLB International feed was produced by MLB Network.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 6.1 |  | 11.08 | [69] |\n| 2\n | 5.8 |  | 10.54 | [70] |\n| 3\n | 6.1 |  | 11.47 | [71] |\n| 4\n | 5.65 |  | 10.78 | [72] |\n| 5\n | 7.4 |  | 13.82 | [72] |\n| 6\n | 7.9 |  | 14.14 | [72] |\n\n\n*Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.*\n\n\nTelevision ratings for the 2021 World Series were 20% higher than the 2020 World Series in the shortened season.[73] It also averaged a higher rating than the NBA Finals for the second straight year.[74] However, ratings were still below the norm in 2021. Game 6 drew a 33.5 rating and 54% share in the Atlanta market, the highest since Game 4 of the 1999 World Series. It drew a 25.6 rating and a 47% share in the Houston market.[75]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFor the 24th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States, led by Dan Shulman on play-by-play with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo P\u00e9rez as color analysts; Kevin Winter hosted the pregame coverage with analyst Chris Singleton and reporters Buster Olney and Marly Rivera, while Olney provided in-game reports and conducted postgame interviews.[76][77]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series to be broadcast on TUDN Radio, which had acquired national rights to Spanish-language MLB radio broadcasts in early October.[78] TUDN Radio commentators included Jose Napoles, Jesus Acosta, Alberto Ferreiro, and Luis Qui\u00f1ones.[79]\n\n\nThe flagship radio stations for both teams also produced local broadcasts of each game. In Atlanta, WCNN and WAOS broadcast in English and Spanish respectively, KBME (in English) and KLAT (in Spanish) aired the games in the Houston market. Outside of those stations, MLB rules dictated that team-affiliated stations carry the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games.[80]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Astros[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, the Astros lost six players to free agency: Carlos Correa to the Minnesota Twins, Zack Greinke to the Kansas City Royals, Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez to the New York Yankees, Kendall Graveman to the Chicago White Sox, and Brooks Raley to the Tampa Bay Rays.[81] Justin Verlander was the lone free agent to re-sign with the Astros, returning on a two-year deal with a player option in the second year after missing all of the 2021 season.[82]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2022, the Astros traded starter Jake Odorizzi for Braves reliever Will Smith. Smith was the pitcher who recorded the last out of the World Series, making him the first pitcher ever to be traded the following season to the opposing team that he recorded the last out against.[83][84]\n\n\nThe Astros repeated as American League West champions in 2022, their sixth consecutive postseason appearance and fifth division title in six seasons. They swept the Seattle Mariners in the Division Series and the New York Yankees in the Championship Series to return to and win the World Series by beating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.[85]\n\n\n\n### Braves[edit]\n\n\nThe much maligned Braves bullpen turned out to be the team's biggest strength during their World Series run. The bullpen was dominant throughout the postseason with the late-inning combination of Will Smith, Tyler Matzek, Luke Jackson, and A.J. Minter leading the way. Closer Will Smith struggled at times during the regular season having posted a 3.44 ERA, particularly with a 5.40 ERA during the dog days of a close NL East division race in August. Those struggles however disappeared for Smith in the postseason as the veteran reliever worked 11 consecutive scoreless innings in October allowing only five hits, three walks, and eight strikeouts with six saves.[86] As it turned out, 2021 would be the last full season the bullpen was together as Smith was traded to Houston at the 2022 trade deadline, Jackson suffered an elbow injury in April 2022, and Matzek had a similar injury before the start of the 2022 postseason in October. The media came up with the nickname '**The Night Shift'** for the bullpen, but Luke Jackson later stated he was the one that came up with the name.[87]\n\n\nThe Braves celebrated their championship with a parade on November 5, with fitting nods to Henry \"Hank\" Aaron, the franchise legend who died in January at the age of 86. On their parade route, the Braves stopped through Georgia State University's Center Parc Stadium complex including the landing spot of Aaron's 715th home run, or where Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium used to stand. Once the parade reached Cumberland and Truist Park, the crowd was addressed by Henry's widow, Billye Aaron, in a fitting tribute to the slugger.[88] The Braves honored Hank Aaron during the 2021 season by including his jersey number 44 on the back of the team caps, along with Phil Niekro's jersey number, 35, who died one month earlier in December 2020. They also painted 44 in the midfield at Truist Park. Aaron was also honored in the design of the team's World Series championship ring, which includes 755 total diamonds to commemorate Aaron's career home runs, and 44 emerald-cut diamonds to represent Aaron's jersey number with the Braves.[89]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThis was Joe Buck's last World Series, which ended a 23-year run (1996\u20132021), the longest run of any play-by-play announcer on network television calling the World Series. Buck and his NFL broadcast partner Troy Aikman signed a lucrative multi-year deal with ESPN, which saw them become the new lead broadcast team of Monday Night Football beginning in the 2022 NFL season.[90] FOX would promote number two play-by-play baseball announcer Joe Davis to replace Buck's spot for the regular season, All-Star, and postseason games.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2021 Korean Series\n* 2021 Japan Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Manny Ramirez hit 29 postseason home runs.[32]\n2. **^** All seven games of the 2019 World Series were won by the away team, while the 2020 World Series was played at a neutral site.\n3. **^** Truist Park opened in 2017.\n4. **^** The \"Rally Nuns\" are members of the Dominican Sisters of Mary Immaculate Province,[57] based in Houston.[58]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Umpires for the 2021 World Series announced\" (Press release).

The 118th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros and the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Astros defeated the Phillies in six games to earn their second championship. The series was broadcast in the United States on Fox television and ESPN Radio.[1]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB postseason as the AL West champions and the top-seeded AL team, while the Phillies won a wild card, earning the sixth and final NL playoff berth. The Phillies took a 2\u20131 lead after three games, before the Astros won the final three games to win the series. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first position player to win the award as a rookie.[2]\n\n\nThe series was notable for having the first World Series no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, when Astros pitchers Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly combined to leave the Phillies hitless in Game 4. It was also the third postseason no-hitter in MLB history, after Roy Halladay's no-hitter (also at Citizens Bank Park) in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series.\n\n\nMLB has sold sponsorships to various postseason series since 2017, with YouTube TV serving as the official presenting sponsor of the World Series from 2017 through 2019.[3] The World Series did not have a presenting sponsor in 2020 or 2021, but resumed sponsorship in 2022.[4] As a result of a new multi-year agreement with Capital One, this World Series was officially known as the *2022 World Series presented by Capital One*.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies following their 1980 National League Championship Series[a] encounter, which was won by Philadelphia, 3\u20132, en route to winning the 1980 World Series.[6]\n\n\nHouston and Philadelphia met in the last series of the 2022 MLB season in Houston. Houston won two of the three games, although Philadelphia clinched their postseason berth in the first game with a win.[7] The 19-game gap between the Astros and Phillies is the second largest in World Series history, trailing only the 23-game gap in 1906 between the 93-win Chicago White Sox and the 116-win Chicago Cubs.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Houston Astros season\n\nThis is the fifth World Series appearance for the Astros, and the fourth[a] as the American League team.[11] The Astros qualified for the 2022 postseason as the American League (AL) West division winner.[12] It was their fifth AL West championship in six years and their second straight divisional championship. The Astros entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League. In the Division Series, they swept the fifth-seeded Seattle Mariners. In the American League Championship Series, they swept the second-seeded New York Yankees to make it to the World Series for the fourth time in the previous six seasons (2017, 2019, 2021) and the second consecutive season.[13]\n\n\nHouston's pitching staff led the American League in 2022 with the fewest runs allowed, lowest opponent's batting average and walks plus hits per inning pitched, the most strikeouts, and posted an MLB-best 2.78 bullpen earned run average (ERA).[14] Justin Verlander, who had missed Houston's postseason runs in 2020 and 2021, made his return from Tommy John surgery and led the AL in wins, ERA, and walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio.[15] Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting 6-for-18 (.333) with two home runs and two doubles in the ALCS.[16]\n\n\nDusty Baker, in his 25th season as a major league manager, was seeking his first World Series win as a manager (he won the 1981 World Series as a player with the Dodgers). At 73 years of age, Baker was the oldest manager in World Series history.[17]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Philadelphia Phillies season\n\nThis was the eighth World Series appearance for the Phillies and the first since 2009.[18] The Phillies struggled at the start of the 2022 season. On June 3, and at a record of 22\u201329 (.431), manager Joe Girardi was fired, and Rob Thomson, their bench coach, was named their interim manager.[19] From there, the Phillies went 65\u201346 (.586).[20] They clinched a postseason berth on the third to last day of the season; they were the last postseason team of the 12 to clinch a berth. They qualified for the postseason as the sixth seed wild card entrant with an 87\u201375 (.537) record.[7][21]\n\n\nIn the National League Wild Card Series, they swept the National League Central division winner St. Louis Cardinals, who were ranked third in the National League. In the National League Division Series, they defeated the defending World Series champion and National League East division winner Atlanta Braves in four games, the NL's second seed. In the National League Championship Series (NLCS), they defeated the fifth-seeded San Diego Padres in five games to clinch a World Series berth for the first time since 2009, which the Phillies lost in six games to the New York Yankees.[22] Bryce Harper won the most valuable player award for the NLCS after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs and three doubles.[23] With their third-place finish, the Phillies were the first team to finish in third place in their division to advance to a World Series since the 1981 New York Yankees.[24]\n\n\nDave Dombrowski, the Phillies' president of baseball operations, made his fifth World Series appearance. Dombrowski is the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.[25]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Houston won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 28 | **Philadelphia Phillies** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 5 (10) | Minute Maid Park | 4:34 | 42,903[26] |\n| 2 | October 29 | Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 2, **Houston Astros** \u2013 5 | Minute Maid Park | 3:18 | 42,926[27] |\n| 3 | November 1\u2020 | Houston Astros \u2013 0, **Philadelphia Phillies** \u2013 7 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:08 | 45,712[28] |\n| 4 | November 2 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 5, Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 0 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:25 | 45,693[29] |\n| 5 | November 3 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 3, Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 2 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:57 | 45,693[30] |\n| 6 | November 5 | Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 1, **Houston Astros** \u2013 4 | Minute Maid Park | 3:13 | 42,958[31] |\n\n\n\u2020 Game 3 was postponed from October 31, due to rain; consequently, all subsequent games were postponed by one day from the original schedule.\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)J.

Nola then gave up two singles to Yuli Gurriel and Chas McCormick.[37] With runners at the corners, Mart\u00edn Maldonado hit a run batted in single scoring Gurriel. Jos\u00e9 Altuve grounded into a double play to end the inning. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a doubled to start the third for Houston and Alex Bregman drew a walk. Tucker hit a three-run home run into the Astros bullpen to give Houston a 5\u20130 lead. Verlander took a no-hit bid into the top of the fourth inning when he gave up a single to Rhys Hoskins. Bryce Harper singled, moving Hoskins to third. Nick Castellanos drove in Hoskins with a single, and Alec Bohm drove in Harper and Castellanos with a double down the left-field line to trim the lead to two.[37] In the top of the fifth inning, Verlander gave up a leadoff double to Brandon Marsh, and walked Kyle Schwarber. J. T. Realmuto hit a double off the base of the wall to score both runners and tie the game at five. Realmuto advanced to third on a Harper groundout, but Verlander struck out Castellanos, ending the inning.[37] At the top of the sixth, Nola was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Alvarado, who retired the side.[37]\n\n\nThe game remained tied through nine innings, and entered extra innings. In the top of the tenth inning, Realmuto hit a solo home run off Luis Garc\u00eda to give the Phillies a one-run lead. After a Harper single and a Bryson Stott walk, Garc\u00eda was taken out of the game and replaced with Ryne Stanek, who was able to get out of the inning. In the bottom of the tenth inning, David Robertson struck out Yordan \u00c1lvarez before giving up a double to Bregman.[38] Tucker tipped off a fair ball that bounced in front of home plate and was thrown out at first. Robertson walked Gurriel, bringing pinch hitter Aledmys D\u00edaz to the plate. Robertson threw a wild pitch to advance the runners to second and third. After working the count to 2\u20131, D\u00edaz was hit on the elbow by Robertson and started toward first base. However, the home plate umpire ruled that D\u00edaz had leaned into the pitch, resulting in ball three. On the next pitch, D\u00edaz grounded out, ending the game.[38] It was the first time since 2002 that a team had overcome a five-run deficit to win a World Series game, when the San Francisco Giants \u2013 also managed by Dusty Baker \u2013 blew such a lead in Game 6.[39]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Bregman hit a home run in the fifth inning of Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 29, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **Houston** | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 5 | 7 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Zack Wheeler (0\u20131)**Home runs:**PHI: NoneHOU: Alex Bregman (1)**Attendance:** 42,926Boxscore |\n\n\nLittle Big Town performed the national anthem before Game 2. Craig Biggio threw the ceremonial first pitch to Jeff Bagwell, and Bun B called \"play ball!\".[35] Framber Valdez started for Houston and Zack Wheeler started for Philadelphia.[40]\n\n\nIn the first inning, Jeremy Pe\u00f1a hit an RBI double to score Jose Altuve for the first run. Yordan \u00c1lvarez followed with the third straight double to bring in the second run for the Astros. With that hit, Houston became the first World Series team to start a game with three straight extra-base hits. Alvarez scored the third run on an error. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Alex Bregman hit a two-run home to left field to make the score 5\u20130. Nick Castellanos scored the first run for the Phillies on a sacrifice fly by Jean Segura in the seventh inning to make it 5\u20131. In the top of the eighth inning, Kyle Schwarber hit a foul ball that was initially ruled a two-run home run, which would have made the score 5\u20133. Schwarber ended up flying out deep to right on the next pitch, again just missing a home run.[41] In the top of the ninth inning, Alec Bohm scored on an error by first baseman Yuli Gurriel to make it 5\u20132, which proved to be the final score.[42]\n\n\nGame 2 was also notable for umpire Pat Hoberg calling a \"perfect game\" with 129 of 129 pitches called correctly. Hoberg received widespread praise from both fans and the press for this accomplishment.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bryce Harper hit the first of five home runs for the Phillies in Game 3.\n\n\nNovember 1, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Philadelphia** | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 7 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Ranger Su\u00e1rez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Lance McCullers Jr. (0\u20131)**Home runs:**HOU: NonePHI: Bryce Harper (1), Alec Bohm (1), Brandon Marsh (1), Kyle Schwarber (1), Rhys Hoskins (1)**Attendance:** 45,712Boxscore |\n\n\nOriginally scheduled for October 31, Game 3 was postponed to November 1 due to rain. Every following game was pushed back one day.[45] Bernie Parent, Mike Schmidt, Julius Erving, and Brandon Graham threw ceremonial first pitches,[46] and Chloe Bailey sang the national anthem.[47] Ranger Su\u00e1rez started for Philadelphia, taking the place of Noah Syndergaard, who would have started if it had not been postponed.[48] Lance McCullers Jr. started for Houston.[49]\n\n\nIn the bottom of the first, Kyle Schwarber drew a walk, and Bryce Harper hit a two-run home run to right field. Alec Bohm and Brandon Marsh hit solo home runs for the Phillies in the second.[50] Bohm's solo home run to left field in the second inning marked the 1,000th home run in World Series history.[51] When Marsh also homered in that inning, the Phillies became the first team to hit three home runs in the first two innings of a World Series game. In the bottom of the fifth, Schwarber hit a two-run home run to dead center, and Rhys Hoskins hit a solo home run to left, making the Phillies the fourth team to hit a record five home runs in a single World Series game, joining the 1928 Yankees (Game 4 of the 1928 World Series), 1989 Athletics (Game 3 of the 1989 World Series), and 2017 Astros (Game 5 of the 2017 World Series); they are also the only team of these four to go on to lose the World Series. Furthermore, McCullers became the first pitcher in history to surrender five home runs in a postseason game.[52][53] Ryne Stanek relieved McCullers after Hoskins' home run. Su\u00e1rez came out of the game after throwing five scoreless innings. Connor Brogdon, Kyle Gibson, Nick Nelson, and Andrew Bellatti each pitched a scoreless inning to complete the shutout as the Phillies won 7\u20130. All seven runs were scored via a home run.[54]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Pressly *(pictured in 2013 with the Minnesota Twins)* completed the combined no-hitter in Game 4.\n\n\nNovember 2, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 62\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Cristian Javier (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Aaron Nola (0\u20131)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nJimmy Rollins and Chase Utley threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 4 and *American Idol* contestant Madison Watkins sang the national anthem; Utley's pitch was caught by Rob McElhenney and Rollins' by Miles Teller.[55] An additional first pitch was thrown out by a 19-year-old cancer survivor; Jill Biden was on hand to support Stand Up to Cancer in the middle of the fifth inning.[56] Aaron Nola made his second start of the series for the Phillies, while Cristian Javier started for the Astros.[57] The Astros and Phillies remained scoreless through four innings. The Astros loaded the bases in the top of the fifth inning against Nola. Jos\u00e9 Alvarado relieved Nola and hit Yordan \u00c1lvarez with a pitch, scoring the game's first run and breaking a 16-innings scoreless streak for Houston. The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-run double, Kyle Tucker followed with a sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel singled to score Bregman.[58]\n\n\nJavier pitched six innings on 97 pitches without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters, and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning. Rafael Montero pitched a hitless eighth inning for the Astros. Ryan Pressly, the Astros closer, pitched in the ninth inning for the Astros, only allowing a one-out walk to Kyle Schwarber, to complete the no-hitter. It was the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and the second no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.[59] It was also the third no-hitter in postseason history, after Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter for the Phillies in the 2010 National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Coincidentally, both no-hitters took place at Citizens Bank Park, and Dusty Baker was involved as a manager in both as he had managed the Reds in 2010.[60]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justin Verlander earned his first career World Series win in Game 5.\n\n\nNovember 3, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Justin Verlander (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Noah Syndergaard (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (1)**Home runs:**HOU: Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (1)PHI: Kyle Schwarber (2)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore Game 5, Meek Mill performed a song on the field and rode with the Phillie Phanatic on an ATV.[61] Philadelphia native Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem[62] and Brad Lidge threw the ceremonial first pitch to Carlos Ruiz.[63] Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies[64] and Justin Verlander started for the Astros.[65] The Phillies donned powder blue throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange jerseys.[66]\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve led off the game with a double, advanced to third base on an error, and scored on a single by Jeremy Pe\u00f1a. Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run to tie it. Schwarber's home run was the tenth given up by Verlander in the World Series, passing Catfish Hunter for the most allowed in World Series history.[67] Pe\u00f1a hit a home run to put the Astros ahead at 2\u20131 in the fourth inning, becoming the first rookie shortstop to hit a home run in the World Series. The Phillies, who had put runners in scoring position throughout the next four innings, did not score another run off of Verlander, who finished his appearance with six strikeouts and four walks allowed in five innings. In the top of the eighth inning, Altuve scored from third base on a ground out by Yordan \u00c1lvarez, widening the Astros' lead to 3\u20131. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Nick Castellanos scored on an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Phillies' deficit and putting runners on the corners. Ryan Pressly entered to try for a five-out save, his fourth appearance in the series. He recorded a strikeout and a hard-hit groundout to Trey Mancini to end the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, Chas McCormick made a leaping catch at the right-center wall on a flyball hit by J. T. Realmuto for the second out, preventing a likely extra-base hit. The next batter, Bryce Harper, was hit by a pitch, putting the tying run on first base, but Castellanos hit a groundball to short that led to the game-ending putout from Pe\u00f1a to Mancini to end the game. The victory was the first World Series pitching win of Verlander's career, who had gone 0\u20136 in his previous eight World Series starts, including Game 1.[68]\n\n\nThe change in the World Series schedule due to rain meant Game 5 went up directly against a *Thursday Night Football* game between the NFL franchises of both World Series cities, in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Houston Texans, 29\u201317. Estimates from Nielsen Media Research showed the baseball game drew an average of five million more viewers, with a share of at least 50 in both Philadelphia and Houston. Meanwhile, the football game, originally scheduled to air on the Fox affiliates in both markets per NFL rules, moved to the MyNetworkTV affiliates in both markets.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit a home run to center field, to a distance estimated at 450 feet, to give the Astros the lead in Game 6.\n\n\nNovember 5, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Zack Wheeler (0\u20132) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (2)**Home runs:**PHI: Kyle Schwarber (3)HOU: Yordan \u00c1lvarez (1)**Attendance:** 42,958Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 6 set the record for the latest date that a World Series game has been played. The latest a World Series game had previously been played was November 4, in both 2001 and 2009.[71] The Astros replaced Yuli Gurriel, who exited Game 5 with a knee injury, on their roster with Korey Lee.[72] Gallery Furniture's Jim McIngvale threw the ceremonial first pitch, Andy Grammer sang the national anthem, and George Strait called \"play ball!\" In a rematch from Game 2, Framber Valdez started for the Astros, while Zack Wheeler started for the Phillies.[73]\n\n\nThe game remained scoreless through five innings before Kyle Schwarber hit a solo home run to right field for the Phillies in the top of the sixth inning. Wheeler allowed Jose Altuve and Jeremy Pe\u00f1a to reach base and was relieved by Jos\u00e9 Alvarado in preparation for Yordan \u00c1lvarez. Alvarado then gave up a three-run home run to \u00c1lvarez.[74] Later in the inning, Christian V\u00e1zquez hit an RBI single, allowing Alex Bregman to score. Pressly pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his sixth save of playoffs, with Nick Castellanos flying out to Kyle Tucker in foul territory for the final out and season's conclusion.\n\n\nManager Dusty Baker won his first career Fall Classic victory as a manager (after 3,884 games managed, a record for a first-time winner) and Houston was the first team since the Red Sox in 2013 to officially clinch the championship in their home stadium (the Dodgers won as the home team in 2020, but that was played at a neutral site due to the COVID-19 pandemic).[75] Pe\u00f1a, who was 2-for-4 in Game 6, won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He batted 10-for-25 (.400) with one home run in the series. Pe\u00f1a became the first-position player (and the third player overall) to win the award in his rookie season.[76] In total for the postseason, the Houston bullpen allowed five total runs over 54+1\u20443 innings for an ERA of 0.83, becoming the first team to throw at least 40 postseason innings of the bullpen with an ERA below 1.00 in major league history.[77] The Astros became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing the previous year, with the last having been the Kansas City Royals in 2015.[78]\n\n\nWith the win, the Astros finished 11\u20132 in the postseason, the fourth team to win a World Series while losing fewer than three games in the Wild Card era after the 1998 New York Yankees (11\u20132), the 1999 New York Yankees (11\u20131), and the 2005 Chicago White Sox (11\u20131).[79]\n\n\n\n### Composite line score[edit]\n\n\n2022 World Series (4\u20132): **Houston Astros** beat Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia Phillies | 3 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 18 | 31 | 3\n |\n| **Houston Astros** | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 7 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 48 | 2\n |\n| **Home runs:**PHI: Kyle Schwarber (3), Alec Bohm (1), Bryce Harper (1), Rhys Hoskins (1), Brandon Marsh (1), J.

Play-by-play announcer Joe Davis called the event for the first time, succeeding Joe Buck following the latter's departure from the network after 25 years as its lead World Series voice.[81] Davis was joined by Baseball Hall of Famer John Smoltz as color analyst, and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, and David Ortiz.[82]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, MLB Network produced an international feed through MLB International,[83] which aired on Sportsnet in Canada,[84] BT Sport in the United Kingdom,[85] and ESPN in Australia.[86] Dave Flemming called the play-by-play of the games for Anglophone viewers, with Dan Plesac as color analyst.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nAudience includes Fox and Fox Deportes\n\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 5.69 | 11.68 | [87][88] |\n| 2\n | 5.34 | 10.99 | [89][88] |\n| 3\n | 6.11 | 11.37 | [90][91] |\n| 4\n | 6.48 | 12.06 | [92][91] |\n| 5\n | 6.92 | 13.01 | [93][91] |\n| 6\n | 6.11 | 12.87 | [94][91] |\n\n\n*Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.*\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFor the 25th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States. Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo P\u00e9rez as color analysts and Buster Olney as field reporter. Kevin Winter and Doug Glanville hosted the pregame coverage.[95] This was Shulman's 12th and final World Series broadcast for ESPN Radio, with Jon Sciambi succeeding him in 2023.[96][97]\n\n\nTUDN Radio broadcast the series in Spanish, with an announcing crew including Jes\u00fas Acostas, Enrique Burak, Alberto Ferreiro, Jos\u00e9 Luis N\u00e1poles, Luis Eduardo Qui\u00f1ones and Antonio de Valdes.[98] The flagship radio stations for both teams broadcast the series locally. In Philadelphia, WIP-FM and WTTM aired the games in English and in Spanish respectively, while KBME and KLAT did so in Houston.[98] During the Phillies-Eagles conflict for Game 5, WIP-FM aired the Eagles game while the Phillies aired on KYW and WPHT.[99]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe 2022 World Series was sponsored by Capital One, the credit card provider, as part of a new multi-year agreement. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.[4]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Houston[edit]\n\n\nShortly after his contract expired after the 2022 World Series, James Click rejected a one-year contract offer from the Astros and the team announced that they would move on without Click.[100] Click became the first GM since 1947 to leave an MLB franchise this quickly after winning the World Series. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan covered the shocking departure, characterizing owner Jim Crane as extremely hands-on and at odds with Click\u2019s management style.[101] \u201cSometimes I wonder if [Crane] thinks he\u2019s Jerry Jones,\u201d one Astros employee told Passan. The The Astros hired Atlanta Braves scout Dana Brown as their general manager on January 26, 2023.[102] A few week later, the Toronto Blue Jays hired James Click to be the vice president of baseball strategy. Additionally, with Click's departure, former Astros star Jeff Bagwell gained more power within the organization.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Astros won the AL West in 2023, but they did not do it in dominant fashion like their teams' from 2017-2019 and 2021-2022. Injuries and poor performance to their rotation saw the team trade young prospects for Justin Verlander at the trade deadline, who had signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets in the off-season.[105] Overall, they finished tied with the Texas Rangers in first-place in the AL West, but won the tie-breaker thus giving them the division. However, in the postseason, the Astros were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, with the visitor winning all seven games on the road similar to the 2019 World Series. After the season, Dusty Baker retired as manager.[106]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nThree months later, the Philadelphia Eagles lost in Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs, suffering the third championship defeat of a Philadelphia sports team in as many months following the Union and the Phillies losses.[107] Philadelphia was the first sports city in history to lose three straight professional sports championship games in one season.[108][109]\n\n\nAfter the season, Bryce Harper underwent Tommy John surgery for his ligament tear. Despite big free agent signings such as Trea Turner and Taijuan Walker, the Phillies started off similarly in 2023 as they did in 2022, particularly without Harper until May, finishing with a sub .500 record at the start of June. They would go 65\u201342 from June until the rest of the season and finish as the first wildcard. They would again defeat the NL East-winning Atlanta Braves in the NLDS before being upset loss by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2022 Japan Series\n* 2022 Korean Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Houston Astros were members of the National League until the 2013 season.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Harrigan, Thomas (November 6, 2022). \"MLB announces 2022 playoff schedule\". *mlb.com*.

Under first year manager Alex Cora, the team finished with a 108\u201354 record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, and finished eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. The Red Sox were the first MLB team to post 100 wins during the 2018 season, reaching that milestone for the first time since 1946; they were also the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason.\n\n\nThe team set a new franchise record for wins in a season by surpassing the prior mark of 105 that had been set in 1912; they also won the most games by any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116. Mookie Betts finished the season with the Major League batting title, hitting .346, while J. D. Martinez finished second in the majors with .330. Betts also won a Gold Glove and the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award. Closer Craig Kimbrel became the fastest player in history to reach 300 career saves, finishing the season with 333.\n\n\nThe Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series. They then defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the Championship Series, advancing to the World Series where they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.\n\n\nThe team was later accused of electronic sign stealing. An investigation into the allegation stated that the sign stealing was \"limited in scope and impact,\" but nonetheless resulted in the suspension of a team video replay operator and the loss of a second-round draft pick in the 2020 draft for the organization.[1] Regardless, the team has been considered the best MLB team of the 2010s, one of the best Red Sox teams ever, and one of the best baseball teams since the 1998 New York Yankees.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### October 2017[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Field-level premium seating near the first base area\n* On October 11, the Red Sox announced that John Farrell would not return as the team's manager for the 2018 season.[6]\n* On October 22, the Red Sox announced that Alex Cora, who spent 2005\u20132008 with the club, had signed a three-year deal to become the new manager of the team.[7]\n* On October 25, it was reported that the Red Sox received approval from the Boston Landmarks Commission to add premium seating next to both dugouts.[8] The seats, later branded the Jim Beam Dugout, became available for the 2018 season, at per-game prices starting at $12,500 for 25 guests.[9]\n* On October 26, the Cleveland Indians hired pitching coach Carl Willis and the Chicago Cubs hired hitting coach Chili Davis and third base coach Brian Butterfield.[10]\n\n\n### November 2017[edit]\n\n\n* On November 2, the Red Sox named Carlos Febles as their third base coach; Febles has been in the Red Sox organization since 2007, and most recently was manager of the Portland Sea Dogs.[11] The same day, the Red Sox named Ron Roenicke as bench coach; he previously managed the Milwaukee Brewers (2011\u20132015) and most recently was third base coach of the Los Angeles Angels.[12]\n* On November 4, Tim Hyers was named hitting coach of the Red Sox; he was previously with the team from 2013 through 2015 as minor league hitting coordinator, then spent 2016 and 2017 as assistant hitting coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers.[13]\n* On November 8, the Red Sox named Dana LeVangie as their pitching coach; LeVangie has been with the Red Sox since 1991; he was a minor league player (1991\u20131996), bullpen catcher (1997\u20132004), and a scout (2005\u20132012) before joining the coaching staff.[14]\n* On November 13, the Red Sox hired Craig Bjornson as their bullpen coach; Bjornson had been in the same role with the Houston Astros for the 2014 though 2017 seasons.[15]\n\n\n### December 2017[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Safety netting near the third base line\n* On December 18, the Red Sox re-signed first baseman Mitch Moreland to a two-year, $13M contract.[16]\n\n\n### January 2018[edit]\n\n\n* On January 22, it was reported that the safety netting at Fenway Park would be extended down both foul lines; to Section 79 in left field and to Section 9 in right field.[17]\n\n\n### February 2018[edit]\n\n\n* On February 5\u2014\"Truck Day\"\u2014equipment for spring training left Fenway Park for JetBlue Park at Fenway South.[18]\n* On February 14, pitchers and catchers had their first workout at spring training.[18]\n* On February 18, the Red Sox re-signed IF Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez to a one-year, $4M deal.[19]\n* On February 19, the team had its first full squad workout at spring training.[18]\n* On February 22, the team played exhibition games against the Northeastern Huskies and the Boston College Eagles;[18] the Red Sox won both games, by scores of 15\u20132 and 4\u20132, respectively.[20]\n* On February 23, the team played its first Grapefruit League game, against the Minnesota Twins;[18] the Red Sox won, 4\u20133.[20]\n* On February 26, the Red Sox announced they signed OF/DH J.

Manager Alex Cora named Chris Sale as the Red Sox opening day starter opposite Chris Archer.[26][27] The Red Sox built a 4\u20130 lead through seven innings, including an inside-the-park home run by Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez. Sale pitched six innings, giving up just one hit and walking three, while striking out nine.

In the final game of the series, Boston scored three runs in the third inning, with two of those runs coming on a home run by Holt, en route to a 4\u20133 win. The Red Sox used a total of seven pitchers, with starter Chris Sale going three innings and getting a no decision.\n**Red Sox won the series 2\u20131 (9\u201314 runs)**\n**September 18\u2013September 20, at New York Yankees**\nIn the opening game of the three-game series, Red Sox starter Nathan Eovaldi held the Yankees scoreless through six innings. However, his gem was wasted as Neil Walker hit a three-run home run off of Ryan Brasier in the seventh inning, and the Yankees went on to win, 3\u20132. New York took the second game of the series, 10\u20131, with first baseman Luke Voit going 4-for-4 at the plate including three RBIs on two home runs.

The second game of the series, postponed a day due to rain, saw the Red Sox score early and often, en route to a 19\u20133 victory. Baltimore starting pitcher Ryan Meisinger lasted only one-third of an inning while giving up five runs. David Price got the win for Boston, while J. D. Martinez, Xander Bogaerts, and Blake Swihart each had home runs and Rafael Devers went 4-for-5 including two homers and six RBIs. Betts had his 30th stolen base of the season, making him the 40th player in MLB history with at least 30 homers and 30 steals in a season, joining the 30\u201330 club.[62] The Orioles won the final game of the series, 10\u20133, scoring seven unanswered runs after the game was tied at three at the end of the fifth inning, just their 3rd win against the Red Sox all season.\n**Red Sox won the series 2\u20131 (28\u201315 runs)**\n**September 28\u2013September 30, vs. New York Yankees**\nIn the first game of the final regular season series, the Yankees defeated the Red Sox, 11\u20136, after jumping out to an 8\u20130 lead after four innings.

Brock Holt homered for Boston. The Red Sox won the final game of the series and their regular season, 10\u20132. Xander Bogaerts and J. D.

This was the first ALDS meeting between the teams (playoff structure before 2012 precluded teams in the same division from meeting before the Championship Series). After splitting the first two games at Fenway Park, the Red Sox won the next two games at Yankee Stadium, eliminating New York and sending Boston on to the ALCS.\n\n\nThe Red Sox' 16\u20131 defeat of the Yankees in Game 3, during a misty evening in The Bronx, included two historical footnotes. Firstly, the fifteen-run margin of victory for Boston accounted for the Yankees' worst-ever postseason defeat.[64] The Red Sox failed to score in only the first, fifth, and sixth innings, and generated 7 of their 16 runs in the fourth inning, chasing starter Luis Severino and batting through the order. In addition, Brock Holt hit for the cycle, the first player ever to do so in an MLB postseason game, capping off his performance with a ninth-inning home run against catcher Austin Romine, brought in to pitch when the New York bullpen was overtaxed.[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chris Sale got the win at Fenway in Game 1.\n![](image)Xander Bogaerts hit Boston's only home run in Game 2.\n![](image)Brock Holt hit the first postseason cycle in MLB history in Game 3.\n![](image)Boston starter Rick Porcello got the win in Game 4, sending the Red Sox to the ALCS.\nGame 1, October 5 at Fenway Park\n\n\nFriday, October 5, 2018 7:32\u00a0pm EDT at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New York | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **Boston** | 3 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 5 | 8 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Chris Sale (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** J.

During the 2017 season, they were fined by MLB for using an Apple Watch to relay stolen signs to hitters in games against the New York Yankees.[202] On September 15, 2017, commissioner Rob Manfred had said in regards to the investigation into Boston's illicit use of an Apple Watch: \"I have received absolute assurances from the Red Sox that there will be no future violations of this type.\"[203][204]\n\n\nOn April 22, 2020, commissioner Manfred issued his report from the investigation,[1] determining that the Red Sox replay operator had \"utilized the game feeds in the replay room\" to decode sign sequences but those actions were \"limited in scope and impact\", as the decoding only happened during some occurrences of the opposing team having a runner on second base and were not known to \"then-Manager Alex Cora, the Red Sox coaching staff, the Red Sox front office, or most of the players\".[1] The video replay operator was suspended for the 2020 season and the team forfeited their second-round selection in the 2020 MLB draft. Cora was separately suspended for a year for his actions in the Houston situation.[205]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Boston Red Sox team records\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Commissioner decision on Red Sox investigation\". *MLB.com*.

The 114th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to 2004, and their ninth in franchise history. This was the second World Series matchup between the two franchises, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in 1916. The series was sponsored by the Internet television service YouTube TV and officially known as the *2018 World Series presented by YouTube TV*.[2]\n\n\nThe Series was televised in the United States on Fox. Steve Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while Alex Cora became the fifth first-season manager[3] and first manager from Puerto Rico[4] to win the World Series. The Series was notable for its third game which lasted 18 innings, a World Series record.\n\n\nThe 2018 World Series was the first since 2000 to feature two teams which had also reached the postseason in the prior year. Additionally, the Red Sox became the first team to win two World Series exactly one century apart, as they had defeated the Chicago Cubs in 1918, while the Dodgers were the first team since the 2011 Texas Rangers, and the first NL team since the 1992 Atlanta Braves, to lose consecutive World Series.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2018 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThe Boston Red Sox' most recent World Series appearance was their 2013 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won a World Series in 1988 over the Oakland Athletics, made their second consecutive appearance, after losing to the Houston Astros in 2017. The two franchises faced each other in the 1916 World Series; the Red Sox won the series in five games against the then-Brooklyn Robins.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A scorebook from the 1916 World Series\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts were teammates on the Dodgers in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Although they did not play together on the Red Sox, both managers played and won a World Series championship with Boston\u2014Roberts in 2004 and Cora in 2007. This was the first World Series with two managers of color;[6] additionally, both managers were born outside the contiguous United States, as Cora was born in Puerto Rico and Roberts in Japan.[7]\n\n\nWhile this was a rare match-up, with the Dodgers-Red Sox having only met 20 times ever, the Dodgers trade deadline acquisition Manny Machado had a long history with the Red Sox. In a game in April 2017, Machado, then with the Baltimore Orioles, aggressively slid over the second base bag and spiked Dustin Pedroia in the knee. Pedroia missed 56 of the remaining 145 games, twice going on the injured list. The Red Sox responded by throwing at Machado throughout the 2017 season, feeling that the slide was a dirty play.[8] Setbacks to his recovery left Pedroia out of the lineup for all but 11 at-bats during the 2018 season. Before the World Series, Pedroia told WEEI\u2019s Rob Bradford about the slide. \u201cI think about it all the time.\u201d And when Bradford asked if there\u2019s been any contact with Machado since then, Pedroia had a terse response, \u201cno.\u201d[9] In the 2018 World Series, Machado was booed heavily at Fenway Park. By the time of his retirement in 2021, Pedroia said he had forgiven Machado and he was \"at peace with the play.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Boston Red Sox season\n\nThe Red Sox finished with a 108\u201354 (.667) record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees,[11] and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason.[12] The Red Sox surpassed the 100-win mark for the first time since 1946, broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912, and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116.[13] The 2018 Red Sox were highlighted by All-Stars Mookie Betts, Craig Kimbrel, J. D. Martinez, and Chris Sale. Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in. Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts. Kimbrel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters in 62.1 innings.\n\n\nThe Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series.[14] Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the League Championship Series.[15] Including their 2004 win that ended the Curse of the Bambino, this was the fourth World Series appearance by the Red Sox in 15 years and their 13th appearance all-time.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\nDespite a 16\u201326 (.381) start to the season and nine losses in an 11-game stretch in mid-August, the Dodgers made the playoffs for the sixth straight year by winning the division in a one-game tiebreaker over the Rockies. At the July trade deadline, the team traded for All-Star shortstop Manny Machado from the Orioles to replace injured shortstop Corey Seager and a former All-Star second baseman Brian Dozier from the Twins. In August, the Dodgers acquired former World Series MVP David Freese from the Pirates. For the second year in a row, the Dodgers broke their franchise record for most team home runs in a season.[16] With a 92\u201371 (.564) record, the team entered the playoffs as a second seed and went on to beat the Atlanta Braves in four games in the 2018 National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games in the 2018 National League Championship Series,[17] becoming the first team in either league to win Game 7 of a League Championship Series on the road since the 2006 Cardinals.\n\n\nThe 2018 Dodgers were the first team to make the World Series by winning their tie-breaker game since the 2007 Colorado Rockies, who also faced and lost to Boston in that World Series. This was the Dodgers' fifth back-to-back World Series appearance (Two came in Brooklyn in 1952\u20131953 and 1955\u20131956, and two came in Los Angeles in 1965\u20131966 and 1977\u20131978), and the first time since the 2014-15 Kansas City Royals to win back-to-back League Championship Series. Overall, this was the Dodgers' 20th World Series appearance.[18]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nFenway Park\n![](image)\nDodger Stadium\n\n*Boston won the series, 4\u20131.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 23 | Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 4, **Boston Red Sox** \u2013 8 | Fenway Park | 3:52 | 38,454[19] |\n| 2 | October 24 | Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 2, **Boston Red Sox** \u2013 4 | Fenway Park | 3:12 | 38,644[20] |\n| 3 | October 26 | Boston Red Sox \u2013 2, **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 3 (18) | Dodger Stadium | 7:20 | 53,114[21] |\n| 4 | October 27 | **Boston Red Sox** \u2212 9, Los Angeles Dodgers \u2212 6 | Dodger Stadium | 3:57 | 54,400[22] |\n| 5 | October 28 | **Boston Red Sox** \u2013 5, Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 1 | Dodger Stadium | 3:00 | 54,367[23] |\n\n\n## Pre-game ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n* **Game 1**: The national anthem was performed by James Taylor.[24] Boston Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski threw the ceremonial first pitch, as he did before Game 1 in 2004, 2007, and 2013.[25][26] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, accompanied by Hall of Famer Jim Rice.[27]\n* **Game 2**: The national anthem was performed by the Boston Pops along with vocalists from the Boston Children's Chorus and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.[28] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by members of the 2004 Red Sox championship team, including David Ortiz and Hall of Famer Pedro Mart\u00ednez.[29] While declining to throw a first pitch, Dodgers' manager Dave Roberts, who played on that championship team, greeted teammates from his former team.[30][31] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, accompanied by NESN announcer and former Red Sox All-Star second baseman Jerry Remy.[32]\n* **Game 3**: The national anthem was performed by Brad Paisley.[33] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hall of Famer and former Dodger player, coach and manager Tommy Lasorda, who was accompanied on the field by one of the team's owners, Magic Johnson; the pitch was caught by former Dodger All-Star Steve Garvey.[33] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of West San Gabriel, accompanied by actor Mario Lopez.[33]\n* **Game 4**: A moment of silence was held to honor victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, which had happened that morning.[34] The national anthem was performed by Ryan Tedder.[35] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley to former Dodger Kirk Gibson, recalling Gibson's game-winning home run off Eckersley in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.[36] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, accompanied by actor Anthony Anderson.[35]\n* **Game 5**: The national anthem was performed by Petty Officer Second Class Mike Dalager of the United States Coast Guard.[37] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by former Dodger All-Star Orel Hershiser to former Dodger Mickey Hatcher.[38] The game ball was delivered by a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, accompanied by actor J.

Kershaw became the first pitcher to start the first game of the World Series in back-to-back years since Cliff Lee did so in 2009 (for the Phillies) and 2010 (for the Rangers) and the first to do so for the same team since Dave Stewart pitched three consecutive Game 1s for the Oakland Athletics from 1988 to 1990.[40] The Red Sox struck in the first inning when Mookie Betts singled, stole second and then scored on a hit by Andrew Benintendi, who subsequently scored on a single by J. D. Martinez. Boston benefited from Dodgers' first baseman David Freese missing a foul pop-up by Betts, and right fielder Yasiel Puig allowing Benintendi to advance to second base on a late throw to the plate.[41] A homer by Matt Kemp in the second inning gave the Dodgers a run, and an RBI single by Manny Machado in the third inning tied the score, 2\u20132. In the bottom of the third, Steve Pearce grounded into a fielder's choice\u2014which was called an inning-ending double play on the field, but overturned by video review\u2014and the Red Sox regained the lead on an RBI double by Martinez in the following at-bat. In the top of the fifth, a groundout by Machado plated Brian Dozier to even the score, 3\u20133.[42] \nSale wound up pitching into the fifth inning, allowing three runs on five hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. The Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the fifth, and scored the go-ahead run when Xander Bogaerts grounded into a fielder's choice. A single by Rafael Devers off reliever Ryan Madson in the next at-bat made it 5\u20133. Kershaw's final line was five runs on seven hits and three walks with five strikeouts in four-plus innings. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh off reliever Ryan Brasier and scored a run on a sacrifice fly by Machado. Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez hit a pinch-hit three-run home run off Alex Wood in the bottom of the seventh to make it a four-run lead for the Red Sox, 8\u20134, with no further scoring in the game.[43] Boston reliever Matt Barnes, who finished the fifth inning after relieving Sale, got the win, while Kershaw took the loss for Los Angeles.[44]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Boston starter David Price got the win in Game 2, his second win of the 2018 postseason.\n\n\nOctober 24, 2018, 8:10\u00a0pm (EDT) at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, 47\u00a0\u00b0F (8\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0\n |\n| **Boston** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 8 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** David Price (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Hyun-jin Ryu (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Craig Kimbrel (1)**Attendance:** 38,644Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 2 featured another matchup of left-handed pitchers; Boston started David Price, who got the win in Game 5 of the 2018 American League Championship Series, while Los Angeles started Hyun-jin Ryu, who took the loss in Game 6 of the 2018 National League Championship Series. The Red Sox again scored first, this time in the second inning, when Xander Bogaerts doubled and then scored on a single by Ian Kinsler. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the fourth inning and David Freese scored on a sacrifice fly by Matt Kemp to tie the game; Yasiel Puig then singled to drive in Manny Machado with the go-ahead run. After the Red Sox loaded the bases against Ryu in the bottom of the fifth, reliever Ryan Madson walked in the tying run and J. D. Martinez drove in two more with a single. Ryu's final line was four runs allowed on six hits and one walk with five strikeouts in 42\u20443 innings.[45] \nPrice only allowed two runs on three hits and three walks in six innings while striking out five. Both bullpens prevented more runs from scoring as the Red Sox won, 4\u20132, to take a two games to none lead.[46] Ryu took the loss for the Dodgers, while Price earned the win for Boston with closer Craig Kimbrel getting his sixth save this postseason. It was also the 100th postseason victory in Red Sox franchise history.[47]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Game 3 Full replay on the MLB's official YouTube channel |\n\n\n![](image)Jackie Bradley Jr. tied the game 1-1 with a two-out solo home run in the eighth inning.\n![](image)Max Muncy hit the game-winning home run in the 18th inning of Game 3.\n\n\nOctober 26, 2018, 5:10\u00a0pm (PDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, 78\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Boston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **Los Angeles** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 11 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Alex Wood (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Nathan Eovaldi (0\u20131)**Home runs:**BOS: Jackie Bradley Jr. (1)LAD: Joc Pederson (1), Max Muncy (1)**Attendance:** 53,114Boxscore |\n\n\nAfter two games started by left-handed pitchers, both teams started right-handed pitchers for Game 3; Walker Buehler for the Dodgers and Rick Porcello for the Red Sox. With no designated hitter, J. D. Martinez started in left field for the Red Sox, in place of usual left fielder Andrew Benintendi.[48] The Dodgers scored first, for the first time in the series, when Joc Pederson homered in the third inning. Porcello pitched 42\u20443 innings, allowing the one run on three hits and one walk while striking out five. Buehler pitched seven scoreless innings allowing only two hits with no walks and seven strikeouts. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a home run off Kenley Jansen with two outs in the eighth inning to tie the game. It was Jansen's first blown save in four opportunities this postseason.[49]\n\n\nNo one scored in the ninth after Cody Bellinger was caught between bases to end the ninth and the game went into extra innings tied at one. In the top of the 10th inning, pinch-runner Ian Kinsler attempted to score from third on Rafael Devers's sacrifice fly, but a strong throw by center fielder Bellinger saw Kinsler out at the plate. In the 13th inning, Brock Holt walked, advanced on a wild pitch, scored the go-ahead run on an infield single by Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez and a throwing error by pitcher Scott Alexander. Then, in the bottom of the inning, Max Muncy walked against Nathan Eovaldi, advanced to second on a pop out to N\u00fa\u00f1ez in foul territory (Nu\u00f1ez made a great catch and tumbled into the stands after making the catch, which allowed Muncy to advance) scoring the tying run after an infield hit by Yasiel Puig and a throwing error by Ian Kinsler. In the bottom of the 15th, Muncy appeared to hit a walk-off home run down the right-field line but the ball hooked foul. Muncy hit a walk-off home run off Eovaldi in the 18th inning to win it for the Dodgers, 3\u20132, to cut their series deficit to 2\u20131. Eovaldi had just begun his seventh inning of relief.\n\n\nAt 18 innings and seven hours and 20 minutes, this contest became the longest World Series game by both innings and time, surpassing (in playing time) Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, which lasted 14 innings and five hours and 41 minutes, and breaking the record (in innings) first set in Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, when the Red Sox and Dodgers (then known as the Robins) played 14 innings.[50] \nMuncy tied the record for latest (18th inning) walk-off hit in postseason history, equalling Chris Burke in Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series.[51] It was also the Dodgers' first game-winning World Series home run since Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The game took longer to play than the entire 1939 World Series, which had seven hours and five minutes of total playing time over four games.[52] Until Game 1 of the 2020 World Series, this was the last time a team won a World Series game in their home ballpark.\n\n\nUntil Game 1 of the 2022 World Series, this is the last World Series game to go to extra innings.\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steve Pearce had four RBIs and scored twice in Boston's Game 4 win.\n\n\nOctober 27, 2018, 5:11\u00a0pm (PDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Boston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 8 | 1\n |\n| Los Angeles | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Joe Kelly (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Dylan Floro (0\u20131)**Home runs:**BOS: Mitch Moreland (1), Steve Pearce (1)LAD: Yasiel Puig (1), Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (1)**Attendance:** 54,400Boxscore |\n\n\nFollowing the longest game in World Series history, the Dodgers started Rich Hill while Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez made his first start of the postseason for the Red Sox. At 38 years old, Hill was the oldest player to start a World Series game since 39-year-old Tim Hudson started two games for the San Francisco Giants in 2014 and the oldest for the Dodgers since Sal Maglie in 1956.[53] As he had pitched in relief in Game 3, Rodr\u00edguez became just the sixth pitcher in history to start a World Series game with zero days rest, and the first since Firpo Marberry of the Washington Senators in the 1924 World Series.[54] The Red Sox had intended to start Nathan Eovaldi, but he needed rest after throwing 97 pitches in relief in Game 3.[55] With no designated hitter, the Red Sox started an outfield of Andrew Benintendi, Mookie Betts, and J. D. Martinez, with Jackie Bradley Jr. on the bench in place of Benintendi, who did not start the previous game.[56]\n\n\nThe game was scoreless through the first five innings. In the bottom of the sixth, the Dodgers loaded the bases against Rodr\u00edguez and scored the game's first run on a throwing error by catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez. The next batter, Yasiel Puig, hit a three-run home run to extend the lead to 4\u20130. In a fit of rage, Rodr\u00edguez slammed his glove down on the mound in frustration and was later pulled after pitching 52\u20443 innings, allowing the four runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. At that point, Red Sox ace Chris Sale made an angry speech that fired up his teammates in the dugout.[57] In the top of the seventh, after striking out Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez with a runner on first, Hill was taken off the mound in favor of reliever Ryan Madson, a decision by Roberts which was criticized by several including then-current President Donald Trump.[58] Mitch Moreland hit a three-run pinch-hit home run off of Madson to make it a one-run game. Hill was charged with one run in 6+1\u20443 innings on one hit and three walks with seven strikeouts. Madson set a new World Series record by allowing seven inherited runners to score in the series. Steve Pearce hit a homer off Kenley Jansen in the eighth inning. This was the second straight day Jansen allowed a game-tying home run in that inning.[59] \nJansen became just the second pitcher in World Series history to allow game-tying home runs in back-to-back games (Byung-hyun Kim for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001 was the other). In the top of the ninth, Brock Holt doubled off Dylan Floro and was driven in by a single by pinch hitter Rafael Devers to give Boston their first lead of the game. The Red Sox loaded the bases against Floro and Alex Wood and then Pearce doubled to right-center off Kenta Maeda, scoring all three base runners to put the Red Sox up, 8\u20134. They added another run when Xander Bogaerts drove in Pearce with a single. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez hit a two-run homer off of Craig Kimbrel in the ninth to cut the lead to three. Kimbrel was able to get the last three outs and the Red Sox took a three games to one lead.[60]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Cora, seen here as a player in 2008, led the Red Sox to the World Series championship in his first year as manager.\n\n\nOctober 28, 2018, 5:17\u00a0pm (PDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Boston** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 0\n |\n| Los Angeles | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** David Price (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Clayton Kershaw (0\u20132)**Home runs:**BOS: Steve Pearce 2 (3), Mookie Betts (1), J.

The Red Sox scored in the top of the inning after a one out single by Andrew Benintendi followed by a two-run home run by Steve Pearce. David Freese led off the bottom of the inning with a home run for the Dodgers. No one else scored until the sixth inning, when Mookie Betts hit a home run with one out and then J. D. Martinez hit a lead-off homer in the seventh to make it 4\u20131. Kershaw pitched seven innings, allowing four runs on seven hits, with five strikeouts and no walks.[67] \nIn the eighth inning, Pearce hit another home run, this time off of Pedro B\u00e1ez. Price pitched into the eighth, allowing only one run on three hits and two walks while striking out five. He became just the fifth pitcher to pitch 6+ innings and allow three or fewer hits in three straight postseason starts.[68] Joe Kelly and Chris Sale pitched the last two innings and both struck out the side, Sale getting Manny Machado to strike out for the last out, the Red Sox winning the game 5\u20131 and the title 4\u20131.[69] Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[70]\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n2018 World Series **(4\u20131): Boston Red Sox** (AL) beat Los Angeles Dodgers (NL).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 16 | 34 | 1\n |\n| **Boston Red Sox** | 4 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 1 | 7 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 28 | 42 | 2\n |\n| **Home runs:**LAD: David Freese (1), Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (1), Matt Kemp (1), Max Muncy (1), Joc Pederson (1), Yasiel Puig (1)BOS: Steve Pearce (3), Mookie Betts (1), Jackie Bradley Jr. (1), J.

Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci were the field reporters.[72] Fox Deportes offered a Spanish-language feed, with Rolando Nichols providing play-by-play and Carlos \u00c1lvarez and Edgar Gonzalez doing color commentary.[73]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, MLB International carried the series with play-by-play by Matt Vasgersian and color commentary by Buck Martinez.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 8.2 | 16 | 13.761 | [74] |\n| 2\n | 8.1 | 15 | 13.458 | [75] |\n| 3\n | 7.9 | 18 | 13.251 | [76] |\n| 4\n | 7.9 | 16 | 13.563 | [77] |\n| 5\n | 10.0 | 18 | 17.634 | [78] |\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio broadcast all the World Series games in English for the 21st straight year as part of *Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio*.[72] Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Chris Singleton serving as color analyst and Buster Olney as field reporter. Marc Kestecher hosted the pre-game show with Olney and Tim Kurkjian reporting. Jon Sciambi called the play-by-play for Game 5 due to Shulman developing laryngitis.[79]\n\n\nESPN Deportes Radio provided Spanish-language coverage of the Series. Eduardo Ortega called the play-by-play and Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, Renato Bermudez, and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Rivera served as analysts.[80]\n\n\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers, which were simulcast over SiriusXM radio. In Los Angeles, the broadcast was on AM 570 LA Sports with Charley Steiner and Rick Monday in English, on Univision America 1020 with Jaime Jarr\u00edn and Jorge Jarr\u00edn in Spanish, and on Radio Korea 1540 AM in Korean. The Red Sox broadcast was on WEEI 93.7 FM in English with Joe Castiglione, Tim Neverett and Lou Merloni, and in Spanish on WCCM 1490 AM with Uri Berenguer.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Red Sox held a victory parade in Boston on October 31.\nThe 2018 World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV, the second consecutive year that the service sponsored the series. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties, on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.[84] As part of the agreement, YouTube TV would later sponsor the 2019 World Series.[2]\n\n\n\n## Celebration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Red Sox at the White House with President Trump on May 9, 2019\nOn the morning of October 31, the Red Sox celebration parade began at Fenway Park and made its way downtown to its final destination on Staniford Street.[85][86] During the celebration, the World Series trophy sustained minor damage from a beer can thrown by a spectator; it was subsequently repaired.[87]\n\n\nAn 80-minute documentary, *2018 World Series: Damage Done*, which was produced by MLB and narrated by Uzo Aduba,[88] was released on December 4.[89]\n\n\nOn December 3, Red Sox president Sam Kennedy announced that team accepted an invitation to visit the White House.[90] Originally planned for February 15, 2019, the visit was postponed to May 9, 2019, due to the 2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown.[91] Alex Cora announced that he would not attend, citing the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico.[92] On May 9, various team members along with owner John W. Henry and president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski visited the White House and met with President Trump.[93][94]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Miscellaneous[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2018\u20132019 off-season, the Dodgers signed former Red Sox reliever Joe Kelly to a three-year deal.[95] Kelly was marvelous in the World Series against the Dodgers, having struck out ten batters and not allowing a run in five games pitched. Kelly, an Angels fan who disliked the Dodgers growing up in Corona,[96] became a fan favorite with Dodger fans throughout his tenure with the team.[97][98]\n\n\nFour months after the 2018 World Series, the Patriots won Super Bowl LIII, meaning the greater Boston area celebrated multiple championships for the 2018 MLB and NFL seasons. Greater Boston accomplished feat 14 years previously when the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, while the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years. Like the \u201818 Red Sox, the Patriots beat a Los Angeles team (the Rams) in the Championship Game.\n\n\nAs of 2024, this is the most recent World Series to have had no games played in Texas. The Houston Astros would win AL pennants in 2019, 2021 and 2022, while the Texas Rangers, who won the AL pennant in 2023, also hosted the 2020 World Series due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n### Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 World Series would be the peak for the 2016\u20132018 Red Sox, who were the first Red Sox teams in franchise history to win the American League East for three straight seasons.[99] President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski was fired on September 9, 2019, just 10 months after winning the 2018 World Series. On the field, Boston's top three starters in 2018 \u2014 Chris Sale, David Price, and Nathan Eovaldi \u2014 all missed significant time due to injury in 2019. Overall, the Red Sox would finish 19 games behind the AL East-leading Yankees in 2019. After the season, the team replaced Dombrowski with Tampa Bay Rays executive Chaim Bloom.\n\n\nThree significant events happened to the Red Sox before the start of the 2020 season that shaped the course of the team's future:\n\n\n\n* On January 7, 2020, the Red Sox were implicated in another sign stealing scandal (the team had previously been fined in 2017 for sign stealing)[100] after three unnamed team members told The Athletic that the Red Sox had used their replay room to steal signs of opposing teams during the 2018 season.[101] On January 13, 2020, Manfred stated that he would determine the appropriate punishment for Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was also implicated in the Astros scandal, when the investigation was completed. The next day, Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways and it was announced he would be suspended for the full season.[102] A few days after his season long suspension ended, Cora was re-hired by the team.\n* On February 10, 2020, the Red Sox traded Mookie Betts, David Price, and cash considerations (Boston would also continue to pay half of Price's contract) to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Alex Verdugo, Connor Wong, and Jeter Downs. The trade was very unpopular among Red Sox fans, as Betts was seen as the Red Sox best player and one of the biggest stars in baseball.[103][104]\n* On March 19, 2020, the team announced that Chris Sale would have to undergo Tommy John surgery, effectively making him unable to pitch for all of 2020 and half of 2021.[105]\n* On April 22, 2020, the Red Sox were found guilty of stealing signs throughout the 2018 season through use of a replay room operator. The replay room operator, J.T. Watkins, was suspended throughout the 2020 season and barred from working in the replay room for the 2021 season. The Red Sox were also fined with the loss of a second-round draft pick during the 2020 draft.[106]\n\n\nThe Red Sox would finish the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season 24\u201336 (.400 winning percentage), which was their worst season since 1965.[107] The team would rebound in 2021 and make it all the way to the ALCS before eventually losing to the Houston Astros in six games.\n\n\nDombrowski would later help lead the Phillies to a World Series appearance as lead executive in 2022. He was the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.[108]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nCorey Seager returned to the Dodgers after being out for most of the 2018 season due to an elbow injury, while Manny Machado, who replaced him after the All-Star break, signed a record free agent contract with the San Diego Padres.[109] The 2019 Dodgers broke the franchise record for wins at 106, but would experience October heartbreak once again by losing to eventual World Champion Washington Nationals in the NLDS in five games. The Dodgers became the second franchise to lose to the eventual World Series champions in four consecutive postseasons (the New York Yankees from 2001 to 2004 were the first).\n\n\nThe Dodgers traded for Mookie Betts during the 2019-2020 off-season and his addition made a great team even better. The Dodgers in 2020 would set the record for best winning percentage in franchise history (.717), win their 8th straight division title, and their first World Series in 32 years. The 2021 and 2022 teams were even better in the regular season, winning over 100 games each year, but both times the Dodgers fell short of the World Series.\n\n\nOver the years, 2018 Red Sox and Dodgers would eventually end up playing for the World Series opposition. Along with Kelly, Price, and Betts, Heath Hembree, Craig Kimbrel, J.D. Martinez, and Ryan Braiser joined the Dodgers in the subsequent years afterwards. On the other hand, Enrique Hernandez, Alex Verdugo, Kenley Jansen, and Justin Turner would later play for Boston. According to sportswriter John Tomase at NBC Sports Boston, up to 25% of the Boston Red Sox\u2019s 2023 projected Opening Day roster were players with direct ties to the Dodgers.[110] Incidentally, J.T. Watkins, the Red Sox video coordinator suspended for one year due to his role in the 2018 scandal, was hired by the Dodgers in 2022.[111]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n* ![photo](image)Los Angeles portal\n\n\n* 2018 Japan Series\n* 2018 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2018 World Series Umpire Crew and Roster\". *www.closecallsports.com*.

The team clinched a playoff berth for the third time in four seasons on September 24. The Nationals won their first ever National League pennant on October 15, and eventually won their first World Series in franchise history on October 30, becoming the seventh Wild Card team to win the World Series. The Nationals also set all-time franchise records in home runs (231) and runs scored (873).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMajor League Baseball team season\n\n\n\n| 2019\u00a0Washington Nationals |\n| --- |\n| World Series Champions  National League Champions  National League Wild Card |\n| ![](image) |\n| League | National League |\n| Division | East Division |\n| Ballpark | Nationals Park |\n| City | Washington, D.C. |\n| Record | 93\u201369 (.574) |\n| Divisional place | 2nd |\n| Owners | Mark Lerner |\n| General managers | Mike Rizzo |\n| Managers | Dave Martinez |\n| Television | MASN(Bob Carpenter, FP Santangelo, Alex Chappell, Dan Kolko, Bo Porter) |\n| Radio | 106.7 The FanWashington Nationals Radio Network(Charlie Slowes, Dave Jageler) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2190\u00a02018 | **Seasons** | 2020\u00a0\u2192 |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nationals began their regular season at home against the New York Mets on March 28[1] and ended their regular season at home against the Cleveland Indians on September 29.[1] They beat the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Game on October 1 and upset the two-time defending National League champions and 106 game winning Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the Division Series, before advancing to the National League Championship Series for the first time since 1981, where they swept the St. Louis Cardinals. They won the pennant and advanced to the World Series for the first time in Nationals franchise history. This was also Washington, D.C.'s first appearance in the World Series since the American League's Senators in 1933. They proceeded to defeat the Houston Astros in seven games to capture the franchise's first World Series championship, and the first for Washington, D.C. since 1924. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nationals also became just the second team to sweep their opponent in the League Championship Series since going to a best-of-seven format, and subsequently go on to win the World Series, the other team being the 1995 Atlanta Braves, and the first team in North American professional sports to win all road games in a best-of-seven playoff series when they prevailed over the Astros. \n\n\nAs of 2022, this represents the most recent winning season and playoff berth for the Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Team news[edit]\n\n\nWith the Washington Nationals coming off a disappointing 82\u201380 2018 season, general manager and president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo nonetheless declared confidence in manager Dave Martinez and his coaching staff, all under contract for the 2019 season.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nationals drew 2,259,781 fans at Nationals Park during 2019, their tenth-highest attendance since arriving in Washington in 2005 and lowest since 2011.

Their highest attendance at a home game occurred on March 28, when they drew an Opening Day crowd of 42,263 for a game against the New York Mets, while the low mark was 14,628 for the first game of a split doubleheader against the Colorado Rockies on July 24.[392] Their average home attendance was 27,899 per game, tenth-highest since their arrival in Washington.[392]\n\n\n\n### Game log[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Legend\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Nationals win\n |\n|  | Nationals loss\n |\n|  | Postponement\n |\n| **Bold** | Nationals team member\n |\n\n\n\n\n| 2019 Game Log: 93\u201369 (Home: 50\u201331; Away: 43\u201338)\n |\n| --- |\n| March: 1\u20132 (Home: 1\u20132; Away: 0\u20130)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWashington Nationals 2019 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 2 Adam Eaton\n3 Michael A.

They opened an unusual five-game homestand with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies with a 7\u20132 rout behind Corbin on September 23,[324] then swept both ends of a split doubleheader on September 24, with Hudson saving both contests.

Scherzer struck out 14 over eight innings in his start to secure the series win,[188] after the loss on June 29, in which Voth struggled *en route* to a fifth-inning hook and then Rainey and left-handed reliever Tony Sipp combined to lose the late lead.[189] Having gone 18\u20138 in June, their first winning month since September 2018 and their best record since May 2018, Washington finished the month with a 42\u201341 record, good for third place in the National League East. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFacing their first series sweep of the season, the Nationals rallied behind home runs from Soto, Robles, and Kieboom to tie the game,[note 7] with just-recalled right-hander Erick Fedde putting up four scoreless innings in long relief and Barraclough, Ross, Sipp, and Miller contributing scoreless innings of their own, before replacement first baseman Matt Adams slugged a deep flyball to right field off Matt Wisler in the bottom of the eleventh inning; Adams' shot clanged off the foul pole for a walk-off home run.[103] Fedde was optioned back to Class-AA Harrisburg the next day, and Adri\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez was recalled.[104] The Nationals proceeded to drop consecutive games to the St. Louis Cardinals, ending the month with a 12\u201316 record and in fourth place in the National League East. In the April 29 game, a strong four innings for Corbin led to a disastrous fifth in which he gave up six earned runs, the most for the Nationals left-hander in nearly a full year, and took the loss against visiting St. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nationals scored five runs in the sixth inning to salt the game away, with Cabrera pinch-hitting for Voth and driving in two with a double.[333] By losing the game, the Indians were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2015 season.[334] Washington quickly jumped out ahead on September 28 with a nine-run second inning, punctuated by a Parra grand slam to straightaway center.[335] The big inning gave the Nationals enough room to work around one of Corbin's worst starts of the year, as the southpaw was chased from the mound in the fifth inning after allowing six earned runs in his last start of the regular season.[336] The Nationals won 10\u20137, ensuring home field advantage in the Wild Card Game.[335] They completed the season with an easy 8\u20132 win on September 29, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n330. **^** Reddington, Patrick (September 27, 2019). \"Stephen Strasburg finishes strong; Nationals sweep Phillies; What's next for Strasburg?\".

Despite another eighth-inning hiccup on May 28 as Barraclough gave up a two-run home run, Doolittle bounced back from a pair of rough outings, showing off a tweaked delivery as he secured a save and a win for Strasburg, who outdueled Atlanta ace Max Fried with seven strong innings.[146] An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez returned from the injured list on May 29, with Bourque being optioned to Fresno in a corresponding move, and carried a perfect game into the sixth inning as the Nationals put up 14 runs over the first five frames. Although McGowin, taking over in relief in the seventh inning, loaded the bases and gave up a grand slam to third baseman Austin Riley before getting his first out, he struck out six more Braves en route to his first career save as he pitched three innings to finish off the 14\u20134 victory. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNationals hitting remained hot as the team went to PNC Park to start a four-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Although they lost Dozier to the three-day paternity list as he welcomed a new child, with Adri\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez recalled to take his place,[274] Washington shut out Pittsburgh 13\u20130 on August 19. Ross exited in the fourth inning after being struck by a comebacker on the leg. Guerra pitched 3+2\u20443 perfect innings to pick up the win in relief.[275] Although Strasburg supplied seven scoreless innings on August 20, the Pirates shocked the Nationals with a four-run eighth inning against Suero and Hudson, winning 4\u20131.[276] Corbin kept the Nationals' strong starting pitching going as he led an 11\u20131 win on August 21 with eight scoreless innings.[277] With ace Max Scherzer returning from a shoulder injury, Dozier coming back from paternity leave, and McGowin and Adri\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez optioned in a corresponding move, Washington won the series, again holding the Pirates to one run, with a 7\u20131 win on August 22. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInconsistency on offense continued to plague the Nationals as they began their final roadtrip of the regular season. As the wild card race in the National League continued to tighten, the Nationals dropped two of three against the St. Louis Cardinals. Key cogs in the previous game, Doolittle and Strickland combined to give up the go-ahead runs in a 4\u20132 loss on September 16, with a runner Doolittle bequeathed to Strickland scoring on a ground-rule double by Marcell Ozuna.[316] Washington rebounded with a win on September 17 behind Corbin, who avenged himself against St. Louis after a rocky start early in the season, and Kendrick, who finished a double shy of the cycle. Hudson locked down a two-inning save.[317] The bats again went quiet, though, as veteran starter Adam Wainwright led the Cardinals to a series win on September 18, outdueling Scherzer, who gave up five runs in the loss\u2014the last two on a pinch-hit home run by former Nationals batterymate Matt Wieters.[318]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n276. **^** Reddington, Patrick (August 21, 2019). \"Stephen Strasburg throws seven scoreless vs Pirates; Nationals' bullpen falters in 4\u20131 loss...\" Federal Baseball.

In the series opener on June 4, they pinned a loss on another former Nationals starter, Reynaldo L\u00f3pez, delivering home starter Stephen Strasburg his 100th career win even though he allowed every White Sox run in the 9\u20135 game.[153] After a strong start by An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez in the second game, the league-worst Nationals bullpen couldn't hold the lead, with right-hander Kyle Barraclough surrendering a two-run home run in his second inning of work, followed by Wander Suero, who had thrown 30 pitches in the June 4 game, allowing a game-tying home run to White Sox backup catcher Welington Castillo on his first pitch after coming in to relieve Barraclough. The Nationals rallied, however, as shortstop Trea Turner drilled a two-run home run\u2014his first since coming off the injured list the previous month after rehabbing a fractured finger\u2014to walk off the White Sox in the bottom of the ninth inning, 6\u20134. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNoah Syndergaard held the Nationals hitless into the sixth inning, and former National Wilson Ramos, the Mets catcher, hit a grand slam off Jeremy Hellickson in the first inning to supply all the offense the Mets needed in the 6\u20132 win.[120] The Nationals rebounded to win the next two games for their first series win of the month, with Corbin turning in another potent effort to earn the win on May 15[121] and Washington surviving an early exit by starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez to win a tight 7\u20136 contest, again getting key offense from Parra and catcher Kurt Suzuki, in the rubber game on May 16.[122] With the Chicago Cubs heading to town for a three-game series, the Nationals placed An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez on the injured list with a hamstring strain and called up right-hander Kyle McGowin from Class-AAA Fresno, also activating shortstop Trea Turner after he rehabbed a fractured finger and optioning Turner's struggling fill-in, Wilmer Difo, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 2, 2019, Juan Soto and Strasburg were named co-winners of the Babe Ruth Award for the best postseason performance. Soto hit for a .277/.373./554 triple slash with 5 homers and 14 RBI, with many big hits such as the game-winning hit in the NL Wild Card Game, game tying home runs in Game 5 of the NLDS and Game 1 of the World Series, and the go-ahead home run in Game 6 of the World Series. Strasburg received the win in 5 of his 6 appearances, while pitching to a 1.98 ERA with 47 strikeouts in 36.1 innings. Thrice he pitched in elimination games. The only game where Strasburg did not receive a win was Game 5 of the National League Division Series, where he surrendered 3 runs through 6 innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers en route to a No-Decision, as the Nationals stormed back to win in extra-innings. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nshortstop Trea Turner homered to center in the next at-bat, right fielder Adam Eaton homered to right-center in the at-bat after that, and third baseman Anthony Rendon capped the barrage with a home run to right field.[note 10] During the series, the Nationals activated reliever Trevor Rosenthal after a monthlong rehab assignment, optioning right-hander Kyle McGowin to the Class-AAA Fresno Grizzlies.[158]\n\n\nAlthough Washington steamrolled the White Sox 12\u20131 on June 10 behind another dominant start from S\u00e1nchez,[159] Corbin's struggles continued as he allowed a first-inning grand slam by Castillo, and the Nationals settled for a split of the two-game interleague series in Chicago as they lost June 11.[160] Rookie center fielder V\u00edctor Robles earned his first career Major League Baseball Play of the Week Award with a diving catch behind Corbin, tracking down a hard-hit line drive from Leury Garc\u00eda, leaping to glove it, and ending up face-down on the warning track surrounded by a cloud of dust.[161]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe sweep gave the Nationals their longest winning streak of the season to date, at four games.[154]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Dybas, Todd (April 3, 2019). \"Adrian Sanchez, not Carter Kieboom, arrives following Trea Turner injury\".

Strasburg unloaded on a fastball for a 420-foot home run to left field, his longest career home run and his first since the 2017 season. In his third at-bat of the game, he added a two-run single, giving him five RBIs in the game.[note 12] While the Braves pitched more effectively on July 19, with Julio Teher\u00e1n shutting the Nationals out through five innings before being chased in the sixth inning, the Nationals rallied in the ninth inning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBullpen woes again bedeviled the Nationals during a six-game homestand, which they split by losing two of three with the Pittsburgh Pirates and winning two of three with the San Francisco Giants. The bullpen collapsed late on April 12 after Corbin pitched seven strong innings and departed with a one-run lead; Tony Sipp and Kyle Barraclough combined to give up the tying and go-ahead runs, and after Rendon homered to force extra innings, Justin Miller coughed up a three-run home run to Pirates pinch-hitter Colin Moran in the tenth inning to lose the opening game of the homestand.[83] Miller was placed on the 10-day injured list the next day with a lower back strain, and the Nationals recalled reliever Austen Williams from Fresno. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* December 12, 2018: The Nationals acquired right-handed relief pitcher Tanner Rainey from the Cincinnati Reds for right-handed starting pitcher Tanner Roark.[47]\n* December 18, 2018: The Nationals signed first baseman Matt Adams to a one-year major league deal.[48]\n* December 27, 2018: The Nationals signed right-handed starting pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez to a two-year major league deal.[49]\n* January 13, 2019: The Nationals signed second baseman Brian Dozier to a one-year major league deal and designated infielder/outfielder Matt Reynolds for assignment.[50]\n* February 8, 2019: The Nationals signed right-handed starting pitcher Jeremy Hellickson to a one-year major league contract and designated right-handed relief pitcher Trevor Gott for assignment.[19]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLouis.[105] Ahead of another loss on April 30, the Nationals finally placed Rendon on the 10-day injured list as he continued to reel from his hit-by-pitch arm injury from the Marlins series, and they selected the contract of left-hander Dan Jennings from Harrisburg, designating Austin L. Adams for assignment to clear space on the roster.[106]\n\n\n\n### May[edit]\n\n\nThe Nationals salvaged their four-game series with the St. Louis Cardinals, having lost three of four before capturing a tight 2\u20131 series finale on March 2 behind right-hander Stephen Strasburg.[note 8] After the series, the Nationals dismissed pitching coach Derek Lilliquist and announced he would be replaced by minor league pitching coordinator Paul Menhart.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReturning to Nationals Park for a short homestand against the Braves on September 13, the Nationals were again shut out for the second straight series opener, as Soroka avenged his previous loss and the Braves pinned the loss on Scherzer in the rematch. Scherzer wasn't as sharp as he was six days earlier, giving up three runs in five innings of work.[308] Washington's offense fared little better the next day against Mike Foltynewicz, who gave up an early run on a Rendon double but stifled the Nationals the rest of the way. Voth pitched effectively for five innings, holding the one-run lead, but he bequeathed a runner to Wander Suero in the sixth inning, and after Atlanta cashed in that run on back-to-back singles off Suero, the bullpen fully collapsed in the seventh inning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**.

With two outs in the eighth inning, Martinez turned to veteran left-hander Tony Sipp to face two left-handed batters.

The Nationals stranded 19 runners in the game, leaving the bases loaded in the sixth, seventh, and tenth innings.[196] On July 6, the Nationals celebrated the 50th anniversary of the franchise by honoring the 1969 Montreal Expos.

The next day, the Diamondbacks evened the series, scoring nine runs off Nationals co-ace Stephen Strasburg, the reigning National League Pitcher of the Month.[note 15] With the Nationals trailing by nine runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, Martinez called on outfielder Gerardo Parra to make his major league debut as a relief pitcher. Despite hitting 91 miles per hour (146\u00a0km/h) on the stadium radar gun, Parra was unable to find the strikezone, walking in Diamondbacks reliever Zack Godley before Brian Dozier, normally the Nationals' second baseman, relieved him.

They played their home games at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers went 43\u201317 during the COVID-19 shortened regular-season, and went on to win their first World Series championship since 1988 and seventh overall, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays 4 games to 2.\n\n\nOn March 12, 2020, MLB announced that because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks in addition to the remainder of spring training being cancelled.[1] Four days later, it was announced that the start of the season would be pushed back indefinitely due to the recommendation made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to restrict events of more than 50 people for eight weeks.[2] On June 23, commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps on July 1 in order to resume spring training and prepare for a July 23 Opening Day.[3]\n\n\nThe 2020 Dodgers started the season 30\u201310, matching the best 40-game start in franchise history. The last such Dodgers start came in 1977, along with the Brooklyn teams in 1888 and 1955. This was also the best 40-game start in the majors since the 116-win Mariners began 31\u20139 in 2001.[4] The Dodgers led MLB in runs scored (349), home runs (118) and slugging percentage (.483, tied with the Atlanta Braves).[5] The Dodgers finished the regular season 43\u201317, winning their eighth straight division title, and swept both the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2020 National League Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the 2020 National League Division Series. They then defeated the Braves in the 2020 National League Championship Series to advance to the 2020 World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, their third World Series appearance in the last four years and their 24th pennant in franchise history, surpassing the San Francisco Giants for the most in the National League. The Dodgers would then go on to defeat the Rays in six games, winning their first World Series since 1988, their sixth since moving to Los Angeles, and the seventh in franchise history.\n\n\nThe team's regular season .717 winning percentage is the highest of the post-1960 expansion era. Had the team finished a 162-game season at the same pace, they would have tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs and 2001 Seattle Mariners with a record 116 wins.[6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Dodgers big offseason acquisition was a trade with the Boston Red Sox for All-Star Outfielder Mookie Betts.\n### Front Office / Coaching staff[edit]\n\n\nOn October 14, 2019, the Dodgers announced that long-time pitching coach Rick Honeycutt would be stepping down from the position to take on a new position with the organization and that he would be replaced by bullpen coach Mark Prior.[9] Josh Bard, who served as the Dodgers bullpen coach in 2016 and 2017 before leaving to join the New York Yankees coaching staff, returned to take his old role.[10] The Dodgers also added Connor McGuinness as the assistant pitching coach and Danny Lehmann as Game Planning Coach, replacing Chris Gimenez.[11]\n\n\n\n### Roster departures[edit]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2019, infielder David Freese announced his retirement from baseball.[12] On October 31, the day after the conclusion of the 2019 World Series, starting pitchers Hyun-jin Ryu and Rich Hill and catcher Russell Martin became free agents.[13] On November 3, the Dodgers declined the 2020 option on utility player Jedd Gyorko, making him a free agent.[14] On November 12, utility player Kristopher Negr\u00f3n announced his retirement from baseball.[15] On December 2, the Dodgers non-tendered relief pitcher Yimi Garc\u00eda, making him a free agent.[16] On December 28, the Dodgers released pitcher J. T. Chargois.[17] Pitcher Casey Sadler was designated for assignment on January 15, 2020.[18] On February 10, the Dodgers designated infielder Tyler White and outfielder Kyle Garlick for assignment.[19]\n\n\n\n### Free agent signings[edit]\n\n\nOn December 15, 2019, the Dodgers signed relief pitcher Blake Treinen to a one-year, $10 million, contract.[20] On January 7, 2020, the Dodgers signed pitcher Jimmy Nelson to one-year, $1.25 million, contract that also included an option for 2021 and numerous contract bonuses.[21] On January 12, the Dodgers signed left handed starter Alex Wood to a one-year, $4 million contract.[22]\n\n\n\n### Trades[edit]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2020, the Dodgers traded outfielder Alex Verdugo and minor leaguers Connor Wong and Jeter Downs to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for outfielder Mookie Betts, starting pitcher David Price and cash considerations.[23] They also traded starting pitcher Kenta Maeda, minor leaguer Ja\u00edr Camargo and cash considerations to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher Brusdar Graterol, outfielder Luke Raley and the 67th pick in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft.[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Off-season 40-man roster moves\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Departing Player | Date | Transaction | New Team |  | Arriving player | Old team | Date | Transaction\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| David Freese | October 12 | Retirement[13] | N/A |  | Victor Gonz\u00e1lez | Oklahoma City Dodgers | October 31 | Added to 40 man roster[13] |\n| Rich Hill | October 31 | Free agent[13] | Minnesota Twins[25] |  | Zach McKinstry | Oklahoma City Dodgers | November 20 | Added to 40 man roster[26] |\n| Russell Martin | October 31 | Free agent[13] | N/A |  | D.

He had been on the restricted list from the previous season as a result of disciplinary issues in the minor leagues. He showed up for camp but was unable to make his first spring start due to injury and they designated him the following day.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pitcher Jake McGee was signed as a free agent during Summer Camp\nOn March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remaining spring training games and announced that the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks, due to the coronavirus pandemic.[38]\n\n\nAfter extensive discussion between the players and ownership over the status of the season, on June 23, the league announced that players would report to the home stadiums by July 1 and that a second training camp would begin two days later with the season to begin on July 24, without fans in the stands. A number of rule changes would also be instituted for the new season, such as having a DH in both leagues and placing a runner on second to begin extra innings.[39]\n\n\nOn July 4, David Price announced that due to the pandemic he would opt out of playing in the 2020 season.[40] Pitcher Jimmy Nelson announced that he would undergo surgery on his lower back on July 7, and would miss the entire season.[41] On July 21, the Dodgers signed pitcher Jake McGee to a one-year contract and announced that second baseman Gavin Lux would not make the opening day roster.[42] At the conclusion of the summer camp, they announced that Ross Stripling would take Price's spot in the starting rotation.[43] On July 22, the Dodgers signed Mookie Betts to a 12-year contract extension, through the 2032 season. The deal was worth $365 million and also included a $65 million signing bonus, making it the richest contract in Dodgers history.[44]\n\n\n\n## Regular season[edit]\n\n\n### Season standings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNL West | W | L | Pct. | GB | Home | Road |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers | 43 | 17\n | 0.717\n | \u2014\n | 21\u20139\n | 22\u20138\n |\n| San Diego Padres | 37 | 23\n | 0.617\n | 6\n | 21\u201311\n | 16\u201312\n |\n| San Francisco Giants | 29 | 31\n | 0.483\n | 14\n | 19\u201314\n | 10\u201317\n |\n| Colorado Rockies | 26 | 34\n | 0.433\n | 17\n | 12\u201318\n | 14\u201316\n |\n| Arizona Diamondbacks | 25 | 35\n | 0.417\n | 18\n | 16\u201314\n | 9\u201321\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWild Card standings\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDivision Leaders\n | W | L | Pct. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers | 43 | 17\n | 0.717\n |\n| Atlanta Braves | 35 | 25\n | 0.583\n |\n| Chicago Cubs | 34 | 26\n | 0.567\n |\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDivision 2nd Place\n | W | L | Pct. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| San Diego Padres | 37 | 23\n | 0.617\n |\n| St. Louis Cardinals | 30 | 28\n | 0.517\n |\n| Miami Marlins | 31 | 29\n | 0.517\n |\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWild Card teams(Top 2 teams qualify for postseason) | W | L | Pct. | GB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cincinnati Reds | 31 | 29\n | 0.517\n | +2\n |\n| Milwaukee Brewers | 29 | 31\n | 0.483\n | \u2014\n |\n| San Francisco Giants | 29 | 31\n | 0.483\n | \u2014\n |\n| Philadelphia Phillies | 28 | 32\n | 0.467\n | 1\n |\n| Washington Nationals | 26 | 34\n | 0.433\n | 3\n |\n| New York Mets | 26 | 34\n | 0.433\n | 3\n |\n| Colorado Rockies | 26 | 34\n | 0.433\n | 3\n |\n| Arizona Diamondbacks | 25 | 35\n | 0.417\n | 4\n |\n| Pittsburgh Pirates | 19 | 41\n | 0.317\n | 10\n |\n\n### Record vs. opponents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 National League record* v\n* t\n* e\n\nSource: MLB Standings Grid \u2013 2020\n |\n| --- |\n| Team\n | **AZ** | **COL** | **LAD** | **SD** | **SF** | AL\n |\n| Arizona | \u2014 | 5\u20135 | 2\u20138 | 5\u20135 | 2\u20138 | 11\u20139\n |\n| Colorado | 5\u20135 | \u2014 | 3\u20137 | 3\u20137 | 6\u20134 | 9\u201311\n |\n| Los Angeles | 8\u20132 | 7\u20133 | \u2014 | 6\u20134 | 6\u20134 | 16\u20134\n |\n| San Diego | 5\u20135 | 7\u20133 | 4\u20136 | \u2014 | 8\u20132 | 13\u20137\n |\n| San Francisco | 8\u20132 | 4\u20136 | 4\u20136 | 2\u20138 | \u2014 | 11\u20139\n |\n\n\n### Game log[edit]\n\n\nOn July 6, MLB issued a new revised schedule for the season to start in July.

Dustin May started on Opening Day after Clayton Kershaw was scratched with a bad back. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez drove in five runs on four hits, including a home run as the Dodgers won 8\u20131.[45] In the second game, Ross Stripling allowed only four hits in seven innings while Max Muncy hit two homers in a 9\u20131 win.[46] However, in the third game, the Giants beat the Dodgers, 5\u20134, a shaky Alex Wood allowed three runs in only three innings of work.[47] The Giants beat the Dodgers on July 26 to finish the opening four game series with a split.[48]\n\n\nIn their first road series of the season, the Dodgers beat the Houston Astros 5\u20132 at Minute Maid Park on July 28.[49] Reliever Joe Kelly was suspended for eight games after throwing at Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa in the game.[50] In the following game, Edwin R\u00edos hit a two-run home run in the 13th inning as the Dodgers won, 4\u20132, to sweep the two game series.[51] In the next series, the Dodgers took on the Arizona Diamondbacks for four games at Chase Field, starting with a 6\u20133 win, which included three home runs (by A.J. Pollock, Corey Seager, and Max Muncy).[52] However the bullpen melted down in the 8th inning in the following game, as they lost 5\u20133.[53]\n\n\n\n#### August[edit]\n\n\nIn the third game of the series, Edwin R\u00edos, A. J. Pollock, Matt Beaty, and Chris Taylor each homered as the Dodgers routed the Diamondbacks 11\u20132.[54] In the final game of the series, Clayton Kershaw made his season debut, pitched 52\u20443 scoreless innings and Cody Bellinger and Mookie Betts each homered as the Dodgers shut out the Diamondbacks 3\u20130 to take the series.[55] The Dodgers next began a three-game series at Petco Park against the San Diego Padres, with the Padres taking game one of the series, 5\u20134, thanks to three home runs.[56] The next night, Dustin May struck out a career high eight batters in six innings to pick up his first win of the season in the Dodgers 5\u20132 victory.[57] Joc Pederson homered twice as the Dodgers withstood a late comeback to hold off the Padres 7\u20136 to take the series.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rookie Edwin R\u00edos hit eight home runs on the season\nThe Dodgers returned home to begin a seven-game homestand, starting with a three-game weekend series with the Giants. In the series opener, Will Smith, Betts, Max Muncy and R\u00edos each homered as the Dodgers won 7\u20132.[59] Kershaw allowed three home runs in the next game and the Dodgers lost 5\u20134.[60] In the final game of the series, the Dodger offense was silent and trailed 2\u20130 until Pollock and Betts each hit three-run homers in the seventh and eighth innings respectively to lead the Dodgers to a 6\u20132 victory to take the series from the Giants.[61] The Padres were the Dodgers next opponent, and beat them in the opener 2\u20131 in a pitchers' duel in the first game[62] and 6\u20132 in the second game, with a grand slam homer by Manny Machado being the key hit.[63] In the following game, Tony Gonsolin struck out eight batters in his second start of the season and Justin Turner hit a three-run homer as the Dodgers won 6\u20130.[64] In the final game of the series with the Padres, the Dodgers slugged six home runs (including three from Mookie Betts) to pick up a 11\u20132 victory and a split of the series.[65]\n\n\nThe Dodgers next trip was a three-game set against the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium. They won the opener 7\u20134 on two homers by Cody Bellinger as Clayton Kershaw only allowed one hit in seven innings.[66] The Dodgers took the next game as well, edging the Angels, 6\u20135 in 10 innings as Betts homered and had three RBI in the game.[67] They finished off the sweep the next day, 8\u20133. Keibert Ruiz in his Major League debut homered in his first at-bat, one of four homers hit by the Dodgers in the rout.[68]\n\n\nThe Dodgers next played the Seattle Mariners for four games, with the first two being at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and the second pair being at T-Mobile Park in Seattle. They won the opener 11\u20139 in a back-and-forth battle when the Dodgers scored five runs in the seventh inning to respond to the Mariners scoring five runs in the third inning. Corey Seager and his brother, Mariners Third-Baseman Kyle Seager, both homered in the game, becoming the first pair of brothers to homer in the same game since C\u00e9sar and Felipe Crespo did it on June 7, 2001.[69] In the next game, the Dodgers won 2\u20131 with Austin Barnes scoring both runs.[70] In the first game in Seattle, the Mariners won 6\u20134 thanks to a three-run homer by Austin Nola.[71] The Dodgers wrapped up the series with a 6\u20131 win on August 20, Kershaw struck out 11 while allowing only four hits in seven innings and in the process passed Don Drysdale for the second most strikeouts in Dodgers franchise history.[72]\n\n\nThe Dodgers returned home to face the Colorado Rockies for a brief three game weekend series. In the series opener, the Dodgers beat the Rockies 6\u20131 behind Walker Buehler strong pitching performance, striking out 11 while allowing one earned run and four hits.[73] In the second game of the series, Bellinger hit a walk-off home run to propel the Dodgers to a 4\u20133 victory.[74] The Dodgers swept the series by hitting seven home runs, including two by Mookie Betts, in a 11\u20133 rout over the Rockies.[75]\n\n\nOn August 25, the Dodgers began a six-game road trip, starting with three against the Giants at Oracle Park. The Dodgers blew three save opportunities in the opener and lost, 10\u20138, on a walk-off homer by Donovan Solano.[76] The Dodgers and Giants chose not to play on August 26, as a unified protest against the Jacob Blake shooting, instead playing a double-header of seven inning games on the 27th.[77] In the first game of the doubleheader, Kershaw pitched six scoreless innings, striking out four batters as the Dodgers shut out the Giants 7\u20130.[78] Joc Pederson homered and scored both runs as the Dodgers won 2\u20130 in the second game.[79] The Dodgers next faced the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field. The bullpen struggled in the opener and the Dodgers lost to the Rangers, 6\u20132.[80] Bellinger and Muncy homered as the Dodgers evened the series with a 7\u20134 win the following day.[81] The Dodgers wrapped up the road trip with a 7\u20132 win. Seager, Smith, and Bellinger each homered as the Dodgers set a new National League record with 57 home runs in a calendar month.[82]\n\n\n\n#### September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Clayton Kershaw picked up his 2,500th career strikeout against the Diamondbacks on September 3.\nThe Dodgers returned home for a six-game homestand, beginning with a three-game series with the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the series opener, Julio Ur\u00edas allowed one earned run in six quality innings pitched while Chris Taylor drove in four runs in the team's 6\u20133 victory.[83] In the second game of the series, the offense went silent for the majority of the game due to Zac Gallen pitching seven scoreless innings until the 9th inning when Mookie Betts hit a solo home run to tie the score at one. At the top of the tenth inning, Kenley Jansen gave up a bases-loaded walk to Christian Walker, but the Dodgers responded in the bottom of the tenth with a game-tying run on a throwing error by Junior Guerra and a walk-off single by Will Smith that scored Taylor to give the Dodgers a 3\u20132 victory.[84] Clayton Kershaw pitched six scoreless innings, striking out eight batters (recording his 2,500 career strikeout on his third strikeout), as the Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks with a 5\u20131 victory.[85] The Dodgers picked up their 30th win of the season on September 4 in the opener of a three-game weekend series with the Colorado Rockies. They scored five runs in the eighth inning to win 10\u20136. The Dodgers hit five home runs in the game as they matched the best 40 game start in franchise history (30\u201310, 1888, 1955, 1977). This was also the best 40-game start in the majors since the 116-win Mariners began 31\u20139 in 2001.[86] In the second game of the series, the Rockies scored three runs in the ninth inning on an RBI single by Nolan Arenado and two-run double by Josh Fuentes to beat the Dodgers, 5\u20132.[87] The Rockies won again the next day, 7\u20136, thanks to a two-run home run by Matt Kemp in the eighth inning, handing the Dodgers their first series loss of the season.[88]\n\n\nThe Dodgers next traveled to Arizona to play the Diamondbacks in a three-game series at Chase Field. In the series opener, with the team trailing 6\u20132, the Dodgers rallied to score four runs in the top of the seventh inning to tie the game, scored four runs in the 10th inning, and withstood a rally from the Diamondbacks to win 10\u20139. Gavin Lux hit two home runs and drove in five runs in the game.[89] In the second game of the series, the Dodgers scored two runs in the tenth inning to win 6\u20134.[90] The Diamondbacks took the last game of the series, 5\u20132.[91]\n\n\nThe Dodgers returned home to play the Houston Astros for a brief two game series. Kenley Jansen allowed five runs in the ninth inning as the Astros came from behind to beat the Dodgers, 7\u20135, on September 12.[92] The Dodgers hit three home runs in the next game and bounced back with a 8\u20131 win to split the series.[93]\n\n\nThe Dodgers embarked on their final road trip, starting with a crucial three-game series with the San Diego Padres at Petco Park. In the series opener, the Padres scored five runs in the seventh inning to beat the Dodgers 7\u20132.[94] The Dodgers took the second game of the series with a 3\u20131 win behind seven quality innings from Tony Gonsolin. Justin Turner returned from the injured list, going three for four with an RBI.[95] The Dodgers finished off the series with a 7\u20135 win. Dustin May pitched 5+1\u20443 innings in relief, giving up three runs (one earned), and striking out six batters. Will Smith drove in three runs and A.J. Pollock and Chris Taylor each hit home runs as the Dodgers became the first team to clinch a playoff berth for the 2020 MLB playoffs.[96] The Dodgers headed up to Coors Field to play the Rockies for a four-game series. In the series opener, the Dodgers scored six runs in the seventh inning to overtake the Rockies 9\u20133. Corey Seager and Edwin R\u00edos each hit home runs while Seager and Smith each drove in two runs.[97] The Dodgers hit three more home runs to rout the Rockies 15\u20136 in the second game of the series.[98] The Dodgers won again in the third game of the series 6\u20131 behind Kershaw's seven quality innings and Chris Taylor's offensive performance, driving in three runs on a home run and a triple.[99] Antonio Senzatela held the Dodgers to only one run in 6+1\u20443 innings and Josh Fuentes drove in three runs as the Rockies won 6\u20133 to avoid the sweep.[100]\n\n\nThe Dodgers returned home to finish the regular season with a six-game homestand, beginning with a three-game series with the Oakland Athletics. In the series opener, the Dodgers got four home runs to propel the team to a 7\u20132 win and an eighth straight National League West division title.[101] The Dodgers hit three more home runs in the next game, but Ramon Laureano hit a two-run go-ahead home run in the ninth to give the Athletics the win, 6\u20134.[102] Seager hit a home run and drove in two runs as the Dodgers won the series finale 5\u20131.[103] The Dodgers hosted the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for the final three games of the regular season. In the first game, the Dodgers hit five home runs, including two by Justin Turner and a go-ahead two-run home run by Will Smith, to outlast the Angels 9\u20135.[104] In the second game of the series, the Dodgers withstood a rally from the Angels in the 9th inning to win 7\u20136 after Joc Pederson, who drove in three runs, hit a go-ahead two-run home run.[105] In final game of the regular season, A.J. Pollock hit two home runs and drove in three runs as the Dodgers shut out the Angels 5\u20130 to complete the series sweep and finish with an MLB best record of 43\u201317.[106]\n\n\n\n## Postseason[edit]\n\n\n### Game log[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Postseason Game Log: (13\u20135)\n |\n| --- |\n| National League Wild Card Series (2\u20130)\n\n| # | Date | Opponent | Score | Win | Loss | Save | Attendance | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | September 30 | Brewers | **W** 4\u20132 | **Ur\u00edas** (1\u20130) | Suter (0\u20131) | **Jansen** (1) | N/A | 1\u20130\n |\n| 2 | October 1 | Brewers | **W** 3\u20130 | **Kershaw** (1\u20130) | Woodruff (0\u20131) | **Graterol** (1) | N/A | 2\u20130\n |\n |\n| National League Division Series (3\u20130)\n\n| # | Date | Opponent | Score | Win | Loss | Save | Attendance | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 6 | Padres | **W** 5\u20131 | **May** (1\u20130) | Richards (0\u20131) | \u2014 | N/A | 1\u20130\n |\n| 2 | October 7 | Padres | **W** 6\u20135 | **Kershaw** (1\u20130) | Davies (0\u20131) | **Kelly** (1) | N/A | 2\u20130\n |\n| 3 | October 8 | @ Padres | **W** 12\u20133 | **Ur\u00edas** (1\u20130) | Morej\u00f3n (0\u20131) | \u2014 | N/A | 3\u20130\n |\n| all games played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas |\n |\n| National League Championship Series (4\u20133)\n\n| # | Date | Opponent | Score | Win | Loss | Save | Attendance | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 12 | Braves | L 1\u20135 | Smith (1\u20130) | **Treinen** (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 10,700 | 0\u20131\n |\n| 2 | October 13 | Braves | L 7\u20138 | Matzek (1\u20130) | **Gonsolin** (0\u20131) | Melancon (1) | 10,624 | 0\u20132\n |\n| 3 | October 14 | @ Braves | **W** 15\u20133 | **Ur\u00edas** (1\u20130) | Wright (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 10,664 | 1\u20132\n |\n| 4 | October 15 | @ Braves | L 2\u201310 | Wilson (1\u20130) | **Kershaw** (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 11,044 | 1\u20133\n |\n| 5 | October 16 | @ Braves | **W** 7\u20133 | **Treinen** (1\u20131) | Smith (1\u20131) | \u2014 | 11,119 | 2\u20133\n |\n| 6 | October 17 | Braves | **W** 3\u20131 | **Buehler** (1\u20130) | Fried (0\u20131) | **Jansen** (1) | 10,772 | 3\u20133\n |\n| 7 | October 18 | Braves | **W** 4\u20133 | **Ur\u00edas** (2\u20130) | Martin (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 10,920 | 4\u20133\n |\n| all games played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas |\n |\n| World Series (4\u20132)\n\n| # | Date | Opponent | Score | Win | Loss | Save | Attendance | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 20 | Rays | **W** 8\u20133 | **Kershaw** (1\u20130) | Glasnow (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 11,388 | 1\u20130\n |\n| 2 | October 21 | Rays | L 4\u20136 | Anderson (1\u20130) | **Gonsolin** (0\u20131) | Castillo (1) | 11,472 | 1\u20131\n |\n| 3 | October 23 | @ Rays | **W** 6\u20132 | **Buehler** (1\u20130) | Morton (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 11,447 | 2\u20131\n |\n| 4 | October 24 | @ Rays | L 7\u20138 | Curtiss (1\u20130) | **Jansen** (0\u20131) | \u2014 | 11,441 | 2\u20132\n |\n| 5 | October 25 | @ Rays | **W** 4\u20132 | **Kershaw** (2\u20130) | Glasnow (0\u20132) | **Treinen** (1) | 11,437 | 3\u20132\n |\n| 6 | October 27 | Rays | **W** 3\u20131 | **Gonz\u00e1lez** (1\u20130) | Anderson (1\u20131) | **Ur\u00edas** (1) | 11,437 | 4\u20132\n |\n| all games played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas |\n |\n\n\n### National League Wild Card Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 National League Wild Card Series\n\nThe Dodgers hosted the Milwaukee Brewers in the best of three first round series at Dodger Stadium. In the first game of the series, Corey Seager hit a home run and the pitching staff allowed only a two-run home run by Orlando Arcia as the Dodgers won 4\u20132.[107] In the second game of the series, Clayton Kershaw pitched eight scoreless innings, recording 13 strikeouts, and the Dodgers scored three runs in the fifth inning to win 3\u20130 and sweep the series.[108]\n\n\n\n### National League Division Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 National League Division Series\n\nAll games of this series were played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, home field of the Texas Rangers. The Dodgers played the San Diego Padres. In the opener, the Dodger offense was silent until they scored a run in the fifth inning and four runs in the sixth inning to win 5\u20131.[109] The Dodgers jumped out to a 4\u20131 lead in game two and withstood a late Padres rally to hold on to win 6\u20135.[110] The Dodgers finished off a sweep of the series by routing the Padres 12\u20133. Will Smith became the first Dodger player ever to have five hits in a postseason game and Justin Turner moved past Steve Garvey for the most post-season hits in Dodger franchise history with 64.[111]\n\n\n\n### National League Championship Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 National League Championship Series\n\n![](image)Corey Seager was the Most Valuable Player of both the NLCS and the World Series\nThe Dodgers faced the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS at Globe Life Field. For the first time this season a limited number of fans were allowed to attend this series. The opening game was a pitchers' duel between Walker Buehler and Max Fried, each of whom allowed only one run on a solo homer (Freddie Freeman for the Braves and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez for the Dodgers). However the Dodgers bullpen gave up the game in the ninth inning with Blake Treinen allowing the go-ahead homer to Austin Riley and then Ozzie Albies hit a two-run homer off Jake McGee to put the game out of reach as the Braves won, 5\u20131.[112] In the second game, Freeman hit another homer and the Braves pulled out to a 6\u20130 lead after five innings as Ian Anderson shut the Dodgers down. However the Dodgers came back against the Braves bullpen, with Corey Seager hitting a three-run homer in the seventh and then they added four runs in the ninth thanks to a double by Seager, a homer by Max Muncy and a triple by Cody Bellinger. However the Braves held on to win 8\u20137 to take a two games to none lead in the series.[113]\n\n\nIn Game 3, the Dodgers jumped on Braves starter Kyle Wright early, scoring 11 runs in the first inning with Edwin R\u00edos hitting a solo homer, Joc Pederson a three-run homer and Max Muncy a grand slam. The 11 runs in the first inning set an MLB record for the most runs ever scored in any inning of a postseason game. The Dodgers added on with a Cody Bellinger home run in the second followed by a Corey Seager homer in the third. Julio Ur\u00edas allowed only one run in his five innings of work, with five strikeouts. They won the game 15\u20133. The 15 runs and five home runs by the Dodgers in the game both set new franchise records.[114]\n\n\nClayton Kershaw, who was originally scheduled to start Game 2, started for the Dodgers in Game 4. For the Braves, rookie Bryse Wilson took the mound. Wilson was making only his eighth career start, and his first in the postseason. It was a pitchers' duel going into the sixth inning, with each starting pitcher giving up one solo home run (Wilson to Edwin R\u00edos and Kershaw to Marcell Ozuna). For Wilson, the home run was the only hit he allowed in six innings of work. In the bottom of then inning, the Braves broke the game open with six runs, and eleven batters coming to the plate. As a result of this 10\u20132 victory, the Braves took a 3\u20131 series lead.[115] In Game 5, the Braves took a 2\u20130 lead after two innings off of Dustin May and the Braves' A. J. Minter struck out seven while allowing only one hit in three scoreless innings. The Dodgers got one back in the fourth on a solo homer by Seager and then took the lead in the sixth when Will Smith hit a three-run home run off of Braves reliever Will Smith. This was the first matchup between two players of the same name in playoff history. Mookie Betts drove in a run with a single in the seventh, followed by a two-run homer by Seager, his second of the night. The Dodgers held on to win 7\u20133.[116]\n\n\nIn the sixth game of the series, the Dodgers got off to a strong start with three runs in the first off Max Fried, including solo homers by Seager and Justin Turner. With his homer, Seager set a new record for the most home runs in the NLCS with five and passed Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez (2003) for most RBI in a NLCS with his 11th. Buehler struck out six in six scoreless innings. Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. doubled home Nick Markakis off of Blake Treinen to put the Braves on the board in the seventh inning. Fried did not allow any further runs as he went 62\u20443 innings, with eight hits and four walks allowed with five strikeouts. The Dodgers won 3\u20131 to force a winner take all seventh game.[117] Ian Anderson started Game 7 for the Braves opposite Dustin May, on one day rest, for the Dodgers. May walked a couple in the first and gave up the first run of the game on a single to Marcell Ozuna. Tony Gonsolin came in to pitch in the second and allowed a solo homer to Dansby Swanson. The Dodgers tied up the game in the third on a two-run single by Will Smith. In the fourth, Gonsolin walked the first two batters and then allowed an RBI single to Austin Riley to put the Braves back on top. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez homered off A. J. Minter in the sixth to tie it back up. Cody Bellinger gave the Dodgers their first lead of the game on a solo homer off Chris Martin in the seventh inning. Julio Ur\u00edas pitched the last three innings to pick up the win as the Dodgers held on for the 4\u20133 victory and became just the fourteenth team in postseason history to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit.[118]\n\n\n\n### World Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 World Series\n\n![](image)Game 3 winning pitcher Walker Buehler\nThe Dodgers played the Tampa Bay Rays in the World Series, the Dodgers\u2019 third World Series appearance in four seasons. Clayton Kershaw allowed only one run (a solo homer by Kevin Kiermaier) on two hits in six innings, while striking out eight in the opener, his 11th Game 1 start in the postseason, tying Greg Maddux for second most all-time. Cody Bellinger and Mookie Betts both homered and the Dodgers started off the series with an 8\u20133 win.[119] The Dodgers hit three home runs in the second game, but lost to the Rays 6\u20134 to even the series.[120]\n\n\nIn Game 3, Walker Buehler pitched six innings and allowed one run on three hits and one walk with 10 strikeouts, becoming the third youngest pitcher with 10 or more strikeouts and three or fewer hits in a World Series game, behind only Ed Walsh in 1906 and Josh Beckett in 2003. Austin Barnes homered and drove in another run on a safety squeeze and Justin Turner also homered as the Dodgers won 6\u20132.[121] Game 4 was a back and forth game. The Dodgers led from the beginning after Turner hit another fourth inning home run but the Rays went ahead on a three-run homer by Brandon Lowe in the sixth, only for the Dodgers to regain the lead in the next inning on a two-run single by Joc Pederson. The Rays won the game in walk-off fashion in the ninth after a single by Brett Phillips drove in the tying run and then a couple of fielding miscues let the winning run cross the plate to tie the series.[122] The Dodgers went back ahead with a 4\u20132 win in Game 5 thanks to Clayton Kershaw, whose strikeout of Kevin Kiermaier in the bottom of the fifth inning moved him past Justin Verlander for the record of most career postseason strikeouts. Kershaw finished with 52\u20443 innings, two runs allowed on five hits and two walks with six strikeouts.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)Julio Ur\u00edas closed out the final games of both the NLCS and the World Series for the Dodgers\nFacing elimination, the Rays started Blake Snell, who had a no decision Game 2.[124] The Dodgers countered with Tony Gonsolin,[125] who allowed one run as an opener in Game 2 and took the loss. The Rays scored first in this game with a solo home run by Randy Arozarena, his tenth during the postseason and third of the World Series.[126] Gonsolin faced 10 batters in his second start, lasting 12\u20443 innings while allowing Arozarena's home run plus two hits and two walks. Snell was removed from the game with one out in the sixth inning after allowing a hit to Austin Barnes, who later scored on a wild pitch by Nick Anderson. The Dodgers took the lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Corey Seager that scored Mookie Betts. Snell allowed only the one earned run in 51\u20443 innings on two hits while striking out nine and walking none. The Dodgers added another run in the eighth inning when Betts hit a home run off Pete Fairbanks. Julio Ur\u00edas worked the last 21\u20443 innings for the save as the Dodgers won their seventh World Series championship and their first since 1988.[127] With the Los Angeles Lakers winning the NBA Finals on October 11, it was the first time since 1988 that both the Lakers and Dodgers won championships in the same year.[128]\n\n\n\n### Postseason rosters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Playoff rosters\n |\n| --- |\n| National League Wild Card Series\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Pitchers: 7 Julio Ur\u00edas 17 Joe Kelly 21 Walker Buehler 22 Clayton Kershaw 41 Jake McGee 46 Tony Gonsolin 48 Brusdar Graterol 49 Blake Treinen 52 Pedro B\u00e1ez 56 Adam Kolarek 74 Kenley Jansen 81 Victor Gonz\u00e1lez 85 Dustin May\nCatchers: 15 Austin Barnes 16 Will Smith 25 Keibert Ruiz\nInfielders: 3 Chris Taylor 5 Corey Seager 10 Justin Turner 13 Max Muncy 14 Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez 43 Edwin R\u00edos 45 Matt Beaty\nOutfielders: 11 A.

The full 162-game regular season was planned to begin on March 26, but the pandemic caused Major League Baseball (MLB) to announce on March 12 that the remainder of spring training was canceled and that the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks.[1] On March 16, MLB announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to restrict events of more than 50 people.[2] This was the first time that MLB games had been put on hold since the 2001 season, when the season was paused for over a week after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\nSpring training resumed on July 1 and was rebranded as \"Summer Camp\".[3] On July 3, the All-Star Game was canceled because of the delay to the regular season. Dodger Stadium, which was set to host the game, went on to host the 2022 All-Star Game.[4]\n\n\nOn July 18, the Canadian federal government denied permission for the Toronto Blue Jays to play their home games at Rogers Centre in 2020 on grounds that repeated cross-border trips by both the Blue Jays and their opponents would be a major risk due to the higher spikes in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared to those in Canada. The Blue Jays then chose to play their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, home of their Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons.[5]\n\n\nAn expanded 16-team postseason tournament began on September 29, with games of all but the first round being played at neutral sites. The World Series began on October 20 at Globe Life Field in Arlington, and ended on October 27, with the Los Angeles Dodgers defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in six games to win their first title since 1988.[6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Schedule[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020 schedule greatly differed from the normal 162-game schedule. In an effort to reduce travel, each team played only nine opponents during the regular season instead of the usual 19 or 20. Teams were scheduled to play 10 games against each of their four division opponents. The remaining 20 games of the 60-game schedule were interleague contests. To reduce travel, the interleague division match-ups were AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West.[9] At 60 games, this was the shortest regular season since 1878.[10]\n\n\nSeveral international and neutral-site games originally scheduled for the season were canceled due to COVID-19:\n\n\n\n* On March 19, the Mexico Series and Puerto Rico Series games were canceled; the former would have featured the San Diego Padres and the Arizona Diamondbacks at Mexico City's Estadio Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa, and the latter featuring the New York Mets and the Miami Marlins at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan.\n* On April 1, MLB canceled the London Series, which would have featured the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals at London Stadium.[11]\n* On April 30, MLB canceled the MLB Little League Classic at BB&T Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, coinciding with the Little League World Series, which was scheduled to be played on August 23 between the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles.[12] This cancellation coincided with the cancellation of the 2020 Little League World Series.[13]\n* On August 3, MLB canceled MLB at Field of Dreams \u2014 a game that was scheduled to be played on August 13 between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago White Sox at a temporary 8,000-seat ballpark on the Dyersville, Iowa farm site of the 1989 sports film *Field of Dreams*. The game was postponed to 2021.[14][15]\n\n\n### March agreement between MLB and MLBPA[edit]\n\n\nOn March 26, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached an agreement on multiple considerations related to the start of the season being delayed, including:[16]\n\n\n\n* The 2020 MLB draft was to be held by July 20 and reduced from 40 rounds to five rounds.\n* Player salaries were pro-rated, based on the length of the regular season.\n* Players will receive full service time for the season, regardless of the length of the season\n* Roster moves were frozen as of March 27, until the season began.\n\n\n### Possible schedules[edit]\n\n\nThe indefinite delay of the season caused MLB to internally consider a number of scenarios for playing the season, as well as analysts suggesting ways it could be done. A shortened regular season, a season with many doubleheaders, and a postseason extending into late November with a World Series at an indoor or warm-weather neutral site were suggested.[17][18]\n\n\nIn early April, Jeff Passan of ESPN reported that MLB was \"increasingly focused on a plan that could allow them to start the season as early as May and has the support of high-ranking federal public health officials\".[19] The plan would have involved all 30 teams playing games with no fans in stadiums around the Phoenix metropolitan area, including Chase Field and spring training complexes. Players would have lived in isolation at local hotels.\n\n\nAnother report from *USA Today* baseball writer Bob Nightengale detailed another MLB proposal utilizing the Phoenix metro sites, but with the additional use of spring training sites in Florida, Marlins Park in Miami, and St. Petersburg's Tropicana Field. In addition, the 30 teams would be re-aligned for the season depending on their spring training sites into six divisions based upon their locations in Arizona and Florida and agnostic to the usual AL/NL demarcations and traditional geographic rivalries, effectively making the spring training Cactus League and Grapefruit League regular-season leagues.[20] No interleague play would take place and the designated hitter rule would be utilized for all 30 teams, with the World Series occurring in November utilizing the larger MLB sites.[21]\n\n\n\n### Disagreement over plans for a shortened season[edit]\n\n\nDuring May and June, MLB and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) were unable to agree on a specific plan for a shortened season.\n\n\nIn mid-May the MLB owners proposed a schedule of 82 games, to begin in July, with games to be played without fans in attendance. To minimize travel, teams would play only against other teams in their geographical division, plus interleague games against teams in the corresponding division of the other league. A team would play 13 games against each division rival and six games against each team in the other league's division.[22] Postseason play would be expanded from 10 teams to 14, with each league fielding three division winners and four wild card teams. A designated hitter would be allowed in all games. Teams would have 30-man rosters available for each game. The proposal also outlined safety measures for health of players and staff and a modified compensation plan for players.[23][24][25]\n\n\nOn June 1, the MLBPA countered with a 114-game proposal, with a regular season running from June 30 to October 31, a November postseason, giving players the right to opt-out of participating, a salary deferral plan in the event the postseason has to be canceled due to a second wave of the virus, and a $100 million advance during the second spring training, among others.[26]\n\n\nOwners then submitted a 76-game proposal to the players on June 8, with the regular season ending on September 27, the postseason ending in October, 75 percent prorated player salaries, and playoff pool money, among others.[27] The MLBPA responded one day later with an 89-game plan with full prorated player salaries.[28] The owners then sent a 72-game plan with 70 percent prorated player salaries, to which the MLBPA replied in a statement on June 13, \"Further dialogue with the league would be futile. It's time to get back to work. Tell us when and where.\"[29] However, the week of June 15 saw the owners propose a 60-game season while MLBPA counter with a 70-game season,[30] which on June 19 was rejected by the owners.\n\n\nAmid an increase in cases in Arizona and Florida, including positive cases among staff of the Phillies, and a Blue Jays player showing signs of symptoms, it was reported on June 19 that all spring training sites would be temporarily closed for deep cleaning, and all players would be required to test negative for COVID-19 before entering.[31] It was then reported on June 20 that almost all MLB teams had elected to re-locate their training camps back to their home cities.[32]\n\n\nOn June 22, hours after the MLBPA rejected the MLB's offer to play a 60-game season, MLB owners voted unanimously to impose the 60-game plan.[33] By allowing the owners to unilaterally implement such a plan without the MLBPA, both sides retained the right to file a grievance against the other for not negotiating in good faith.[34] On June 23, both sides agreed to health and safety protocols. Players reported to training camp July 1.[35] Due to concerns related to the pandemic, several players chose not to play the season.[36]\n\n\n\n### Revised 60-game schedule[edit]\n\n\nOn July 6, MLB released the revised schedule for the shortened 60-game season.[37] In the new schedule, teams played 10 games against each of their four divisional opponents in three series, with an unequal number of home games against each opponent. Each team had 20 home games for division opponents.[37]\n\n\nInterleague play comprised the other 20 games of the schedule, all against the division of the opposite league, temporarily suspending the yearly rotation of which divisions play each other. Like normal seasons in which corresponding interleague divisions play each other (e.g. 2018), teams played six games against their \"natural rival\" and three or four games against each of the other four teams in the division.[37] However, for this year only, the Cleveland Indians were paired with the Pittsburgh Pirates instead of their normal rivals, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Detroit Tigers were paired with the Reds instead of the Pirates. This was done to reduce travel for all four teams.\n\n\nThe season started on July 23, with two games: New York Yankees at Washington Nationals and San Francisco Giants at Los Angeles Dodgers. The remaining 26 teams opened the season on July 24.[37]\n\n\nOn July 23, MLB and MLBPA announced that the postseason would be an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for 2020 only, instead of the normal 10-team tournament. All first and second place teams in the six divisions would qualify for the playoffs. The final two spots in each league would go to the remaining teams with the best win\u2013loss records. The teams in each league would be seeded by division winners (1\u20133), division runners-up (4\u20136), and best teams remaining (7\u20138). Seeding ties would be resolved by head-to-head record, intra-league record, and record in final 20 intra-league games, to remove the necessity for additional games. The first round of the playoffs would be a best-of-three series called the Wild Card Series, with all games to be played at the home of the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason would follow the usual pattern of five-game Division series, seven-game League Championship Series, and a seven-game World Series.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Postponed games[edit]\n\n\n#### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\nCOVID-19 outbreaks among the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals, as well as positive tests on the Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, Oakland Athletics, and San Francisco Giants, resulted in the postponement of a total of 40 games.\n\n\nMiami received confirmation that starting pitcher Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a had tested positive and would not be available on July 26, but the team decided to play the third and final game of their scheduled series against the Philadelphia Phillies at the direction of Major League Baseball. After additional Miami players and coaches tested positive, MLB postponed Miami's four-game home-and-home series with the Baltimore Orioles, and Philadelphia's four-game home-and-home series with the New York Yankees, both originally scheduled from July 27 to 30.[40] In order to allow for some flexibility in making games up, the Yankees and Orioles played two games against each other in Baltimore July 29 and 30, moving them up one week from their originally scheduled dates of August 3 and 4. The Marlins later confirmed that 21 players and coaches tested positive.[41] The next series for both teams, Miami's home series against the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia's series at the Toronto Blue Jays, were postponed. Both series would have taken place from July 31 to August 2.[42]\n\n\nSt. Louis had six positive tests resulting in the postponement of three games at the Milwaukee Brewers from July 31 to August 2.[43] Four additional games, a home-and-home series against the Detroit Tigers originally scheduled for August 3 to 6, were also postponed after an additional seven positive tests were reported.[42] After continued positive tests throughout the next week, St. Louis's three-game series against the Chicago Cubs, originally August 7 to 9, and their three-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, originally August 10 to 12, were postponed. A doubleheader against Detroit on August 13 which would have been made up games from August 3 and 4 was also postponed and later canceled.[44][45]\n\n\nCincinnati had a player test positive resulting in the postponement of two games against Pittsburgh on August 15 and 16.[46] Cincinnati's game against the Kansas City Royals on August 18 was postponed as well.[47]\n\n\nThe New York Mets had a player and staff member test positive resulting in the postponement of their August 20 game against Miami and their three-game series against the New York Yankees on August 21 to 23.[48][49]\n\n\nOakland had a positive test resulting in the postponement of their August 30 game against the Houston Astros.[50] As a precaution, Oakland's three-game series against the Seattle Mariners on September 1 to 3 was postponed.[51]\n\n\nSan Francisco had a positive test resulting in the postponement of two games against the San Diego Padres originally scheduled for September 11 and 12.[52]\n\n\nAll postponed games were made up except for two games between the St. Louis Cardinals and Detroit Tigers, with both teams completing 58 out of 60 games. This had no bearing on the playoff teams other than seeding.\n\n\n\n#### Shooting of Jacob Blake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 American athlete strikes\n\nPlayer protests in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin resulted in the postponement of 11 games.\n\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers announced that they would not play their August 26 game against the Cincinnati Reds in the wake of the shooting, following three NBA playoff games that were postponed the same day. Two additional games were postponed that day.[53] Seven games on August 27 and one game on August 28 were also postponed.[54]\n\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

the playoff bracket on September 15, consisting of eight teams from each league: the top two teams from each division, plus the teams from each league with the next two best records. The Wild Card Series was a best-of-three series at the home field of the higher-seeded team, while the Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series were their normal lengths, played at neutral sites, similar to those used for both the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League playoffs, to limit the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak that could both disrupt the schedule and affect competitive integrity.[55] Specifically, the American League played at the San Diego Padres' Petco Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Dodger Stadium, while the National League played at the Texas Rangers' Globe Life Field and the Houston Astros' Minute Maid Park so that no teams will play at their home ballparks in the weightiest rounds to avoid unfair advantage.[56] The World Series then took place at Globe Life Field.[57]\n\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers and Houston Astros became the first teams to make the postseason with a record below .500 since the 1981 Royals. Both clubs went 29\u201331 (.483) in the regular season. The Astros became the first, and currently only, team with a record below .500 to win a playoff series, as they defeated the Minnesota Twins in the Wild Card Series and the Oakland Athletics in the Division Series, before losing the American League Championship Series to the Tampa Bay Rays. They also became the first, and currently only, team with a record below .500 to win a playoff game, as the 1981 Royals and Brewers were swept in the first rounds they played. They also became just the second team to force a game seven after being down 3\u20130 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS, joining only the Boston Red Sox who ended up completing the comeback against the New York Yankees in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Wild Card Series(ALWCS, NLWCS)\n |  |  | Division Series(ALDS, NLDS)\n |  |  | League Championship Series(ALCS, NLCS)\n |  |  | World Series\n |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 1\n | **Tampa Bay** | **2** |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | 8\n | Toronto\n | 0\n |  |\n|  |  | 1\n | **Tampa Bay** | **3** |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 5\n | NY Yankees\n | 2\n |  |\n|  | 4\n | Cleveland\n | 0\n |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 5\n | **NY Yankees** | **2** |  |\n|  |  | 1\n | **Tampa Bay** | **4** |  |\n|  | **American League** |  |\n|  |  |  | 6\n | Houston\n | 3\n |  |\n|  | 3\n | Minnesota\n | 0\n |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 6\n | **Houston** | **2** |  |\n|  |  | 6\n | **Houston** | **3** |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 2\n | Oakland\n | 1\n |  |\n|  | 2\n | **Oakland** | **2** |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 7\n | Chicago White Sox\n | 1\n |  |\n|  |  | AL1\n | Tampa Bay\n | 2\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | NL1\n | **LA Dodgers** | **4** |  |\n|  | 1\n | **LA Dodgers** | **2** |  |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 8\n | Milwaukee\n | 0\n |  |\n|  |  | 1\n | **LA Dodgers** | **3** |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 4\n | San Diego\n | 0\n |  |\n|  | 4\n | **San Diego** | **2** |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 5\n | St. Louis\n | 1\n |  |\n|  |  | 1\n | **LA Dodgers** | **4** |  |\n|  | **National League** |  |\n|  |  |  | 2\n | Atlanta\n | 3\n |  |\n|  | 3\n | Chicago Cubs\n | 0\n |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 6\n | **Miami** | **2** |  |\n|  |  | 6\n | Miami\n | 0\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 2\n | **Atlanta** | **3** |  |\n|  | 2\n | **Atlanta** | **2** |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | 7\n | Cincinnati\n | 0\n |  |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Major League Baseball rosters \u00a7\u00a0Changes effective 2020\n\n### Permanent changes announced prior to season[edit]\n\n\nThe following changes, effective for the 2020 season,[58][59][60] were officially announced by MLB on February 12:[61]\n\n\n\n* The size of the active roster expands from 25 players to 26 players, through August 31.\n\t+ During this time, and during the postseason, clubs can carry a maximum of 13 pitchers.\n\t+ Any team that is playing the second game of a doubleheader or a scheduled neutral-site game (such as the MLB Little League Classic) may carry a 27th player for that game only. This player can either be a position player or pitcher.\n* The size of the expanded roster in September is reduced from 40 players to 28 players.\n\t+ During this time, clubs can carry a maximum of 14 pitchers.\n\t+ Any team that is playing the second game of a doubleheader or a scheduled neutral-site game may carry a 29th player for that game only. This player can either be a position player or pitcher.\n* Teams must designate players as either \"position players\" or \"pitchers\" before the start of the season.\n\t+ Only players designated as pitchers will be allowed to pitch in any regular-season or postseason game, with limited exceptions (such as one team leading by at least seven runs, or the game going into extra innings).\n\t+ Once a position player has pitched at least 20 innings *and* made at least three plate appearances as a position player or designated hitter in each of 20 games, he earns the status of \"two-way player\" for the remainder of the season plus all of the next season. Players with this status may pitch at any time during a game. For this season only, any player who met the above requirements in either the 2018 or 2019 season qualifies for two-way status.\n\t+ Players designated as pitchers, if placed on the injured list, must spend a minimum of 15 days on the IL prior to being eligible for activation. Position players may be activated after a minimum of 10 days on the IL. Two-way players are subject to the rules for pitchers. The seven-day minimum on the IL for concussions remains unchanged.\n* Pitchers and two-way players optioned to the minor leagues must remain there for at least 15 days before being eligible for recall to the major league club, rather than the previous 10-day minimum. The minimum option period for position players remains 10 days.\n* A pitcher must face at least three batters unless the inning ends or the pitcher is injured.\n* Managers now have up to 20 seconds to challenge a play (reduced from 30 seconds).\n\n\nAdditionally, Rule 7.04 governing protested games was amended to read \"Protesting a game shall never be permitted, regardless of whether such complaint is based on judgement decisions by the umpire or an allegation that an umpire misapplied these rules or otherwise rendered a decision in violation of these rules.\"[62]\n\n\n\n### Temporary rules for shortened 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nThe following temporary rules for the shortened 2020 season were announced on June 24. Note that some of these additional changes supersede the rule changes which were announced in February.[63]\n\n\n\n* Each club could invite up to 60 players to its July training camp. The 60-man pool is composed of players on the 40-man roster and players currently signed to minor league contracts. Clubs were not required to include all members of their 40-man roster in the 60-man pool. The transaction freeze in place since March 27 was lifted on June 26. Only players eligible to play in the 2020 season could be invited to July camp, and only the 60 players included on the list submitted to the league office may be used by the team in regular season and postseason games for the 2020 season. If a player is added to the 60-man pool via trade, free agent signing, or other transaction, a corresponding transaction must be made to keep the total number of eligible players at 60. Players in the 60-man pool who were not on a club's 40-man roster at the start of July camp must be added to the 40-man and active rosters in the usual fashion before they may play in regular season or postseason games. Those not on the active roster train at an alternate training site.[64]\n* The designated hitter was used in both the American and National Leagues.\n* Teams could have up to 30 active players on their opening day rosters. The active roster was reduced to 28 after the first two weeks of the season. Originally, the roster was set to reduce to reduce to 26 players after four weeks, but this reduction was eliminated on August 4.[65]\n* The minimum option period for players optioned to their club's training site is 10 days for both pitchers and position players. The provision requiring pitchers to remain in the minor leagues for 15 days is not in effect this season.\n* The trade deadline was August 31 (moved from July 31).\n* To be eligible for the postseason, a player must have been added to a club's 40-man roster by September 15.\n* Clubs were permitted to carry a taxi-squad of players for away games. Originally, the squad was limited to three players. On August 4, the squad was expanded to five players. The original rule stipulated that if three players were carried, at least one had to be a catcher. It is unclear if that restriction remains under the new rule.[65]\n* In regular-season games, extra innings used the World Baseball Softball Confederation softball tiebreaker rule. Each half-inning of an extra inning automatically started with a runner on second base. The runner was the player in the batting order position immediately before the lead-off batter for the inning (or a pinch-runner, subject to the usual substitution rules). Should this runner score, it was considered an unearned run. This rule does not apply to postseason games.\n* There was a 10-day injured list for both pitchers and position players. The 60-day IL was reduced to 45 days.\n* A separate IL exists for players who test positive for, have symptoms of, or have confirmed exposure to COVID-19. There is no maximum or minimum number of days for this IL.\n* There are no limitations on eligible pitchers. The \"two-way player\" provisions announced in February do not apply for this season.\n* Once the game has started, the postseason rule adopted in 2009 will be in effect in case of inclement weather until it has reached official game status. The game was declared a suspended game, continuing from the point of interruption instead of completely restarting.\n* The postseason was expanded to include eight teams from each league. The first round was a best-of-three series with the better seed hosting all three games.\n* The final three rounds of postseason were to be played at neutral sites.\n\t+ Globe Life Field and Minute Maid Park were chosen to host the National League playoffs; each stadium hosted one Division Series and Globe Life Field hosted the National League Championship Series. Spectators were permitted at Globe Life Field starting with the National League Championship Series.\n\t+ Petco Park and Dodger Stadium were chosen to host the American League playoffs; each stadium hosted one Division Series and Petco Park hosted the American League Championship Series.\n\t+ The World Series was held at Globe Life Field.\n* Clubs were required to have an expanded dugout in order to practice social distancing.\n* Celebrations (such as those after a walk-off hit) were socially distanced.\n* Pitchers were allowed to use wet rags.\n* In the postseason, alcohol and champagne were banned from playoff celebrations, with celebrations on the field, at least six feet apart, and not in the clubhouse.\n* No physical lineup cards were exchanged. Instead, lineups are now exchanged publicly through a push notification on the MLB app which is also pushed to fans following each team.\n\n\nThe following temporary rule was announced on July 30, to be effective on August 1.\n\n\n\n* Doubleheaders consisted of two seven-inning games, as is the case in minor leagues. One doubleheader, which was played on July 28 before the rule change, featured two nine-inning games.\n\t+ If a suspended game resumes with the trailing team having played less than five innings, the game played after the completion of the suspended game will be seven innings.\n\t\t- However, if a game is halted after the fifth inning for a reason that enables it to be a suspended game (like a field issue or equipment failure or if the game was tied when stopped), the game played afterwards retains its nine-inning length.\n\t+ In all cases, a suspended game retains the length (seven or nine innings) that it was scheduled for at the time it started.\n\n\n## Players opting out[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| \\*\n | Opted out after playing during the 2020 season\n |\n| \\*\\*\n | Player subsequently opted back in\n |\n\n\n\n\nPlayers who opted out of the 2020 season[66]\n| Player\n | Position\n | Team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lorenzo Cain\\*\n | Outfielder | Milwaukee\n |\n| Welington Castillo | Catcher | Washington\n |\n| Yoenis C\u00e9spedes\\*\n | Outfielder | New York (NL)\n |\n| Tim Collins | Relief pitcher | Colorado\n |\n| Ian Desmond | Outfielder | Colorado\n |\n| Isan D\u00edaz\\*\\*\n | Second baseman | Miami\n |\n| F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez | Starting pitcher | Atlanta\n |\n| Jordan Hicks | Relief pitcher | St. Louis\n |\n| Michael Kopech | Starting pitcher | Chicago (AL)\n |\n| Mike Leake | Starting pitcher | Arizona\n |\n| Francisco Liriano | Relief pitcher | Free agent\n |\n| Nick Markakis\\*\\*\n | Outfielder | Atlanta\n |\n| Shelby Miller | Starting pitcher | Milwaukee\n |\n| Collin McHugh | Starting pitcher | Boston\n |\n| H\u00e9ctor Noes\u00ed | Relief pitcher | Pittsburgh\n |\n| Buster Posey | Catcher | San Francisco\n |\n| David Price | Starting pitcher | Los Angeles (NL)\n |\n| Joe Ross | Starting pitcher | Washington\n |\n| Tyson Ross | Starting pitcher | Free agent\n |\n| Andrelton Simmons\\*\n | Shortstop | Los Angeles (AL)\n |\n| Kohl Stewart | Starting pitcher | Baltimore\n |\n| Marcus Stroman | Starting pitcher | New York (NL)\n |\n| Mark Zagunis | Outfielder | Chicago (NL)\n |\n| Ryan Zimmerman | First baseman | Washington\n |\n\n\n## Managerial changes[edit]\n\n\n### General managers[edit]\n\n\n#### Offseason[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Former GM\n | Reason For Leaving\n | New GM\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Boston Red Sox | Dave Dombrowski | Fired\n | Brian O'Halloran | Dombrowski, whose title was President of Baseball Operations, was unexpectedly fired on September 9, 2019, less than one year after the Red Sox won the World Series.[67]On October 25, 2019, the Red Sox hired the 36-year-old Chaim Bloom as Chief Baseball Officer, succeeding Dombrowski as head of their baseball operations, with Brian O'Halloran named general manager and reporting to Bloom.[68] |\n| Pittsburgh Pirates | Neal Huntington | Ben Cherington | Huntington was fired on October 28, 2019.

Cora had been under investigation by MLB over the Houston Astros' use of hidden cameras to steal signs during that team's 2017 championship season (while Cora was the bench coach) as well as under investigation of allegations that the Red Sox engaged in impermissible electronic sign stealing in 2018 (while Cora was the manager). In his two seasons as Red Sox manager, he compiled a record of 192\u2013132 (.593), winning the 2018 World Series.[93]\nRoenicke was promoted from bench coach to interim manager on February 11. A longtime coach, his only managerial experience was with the Milwaukee Brewers from 2011 to 2015, compiling a record of 342\u2013331 (.508), with one playoff appearance and a 5\u20136 (.455) record in the postseason.[94] On April 22, the \"interim\" tag was removed from Roenicke's title, following MLB's findings about the 2018 Red Sox, which focused on the team's video replay operator.[95]\n |\n\n\n#### In-season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Former manager\n | Interim manager\n | Reason for leaving\n | New manager\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Detroit Tigers | Ron Gardenhire | Lloyd McClendon | Retired\n | A.

He joins Sammy Sosa and Johnny Mize as the only other players to accomplish this feat.[98]\n* Luis Garcia (WAS):\n\t+ Became the first Major League player born in the 2000s to hit a home run. He accomplished this feat on August 17 against the Atlanta Braves.[99]\n* Jos\u00e9 Abreu (CWS):\n\t+ Abreu hit home runs in four consecutive at-bats over two days to tie the Major League record. Abreu hit home runs in his last three at-bats on August 22 against the Chicago Cubs and then connected on his first at-bat on August 23. Abreu's feat was the 43rd in league history.[100]\n* Ian Happ / Jason Heyward / Kyle Schwarber (CHC):\n\t+ All three outfielders each hit two home runs on August 30 against the Cincinnati Reds.

LeMahieu recorded a batting average of .364, while Voit hit 22 home runs.[106]\n* Alex Kirilloff (MIN):\n\t+ Made his Major League debut against the Houston Astros on September 30 during the Wild Card Series. This marks the first time a player has made his debut by starting a postseason game.[107]\n* Josh Naylor (CLE):\n\t+ Became the first player in Major League history to record a hit in each of his first five postseason plate appearances.

Although they were allowed to conduct training camp with stricter protocols than those mandated by MLB, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino cited that repeated cross-border travel by players would carry a major risk due to the higher number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.[165] Mendicino did not rule out the permission being granted for postseason games, depending on the status of the pandemic in the U.S. by then, however the Blue Jays would not have any home postseason games.\n\n\nOn July 20, the Pittsburgh Pirates offered the use of PNC Park as a site for Blue Jays home games.[166][167] However, health officials in Pennsylvania denied permission for this arrangement, citing concerns over additional travel to and from Pittsburgh amid an increase in local cases.[168]\n\n\nOn July 24, the Blue Jays announced that they would play the majority of their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, home of the Jays' AAA affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons.[169][170][171] The Jays' first game in Buffalo was August 11 against the Miami Marlins. The Jays' first two home series against the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies were relocated to the visiting teams' venues, Nationals Park and Citizens Bank Park, respectively, with the Jays as designated home team.[169][171][172] However, the Phillies series was postponed and made up in Buffalo.[173]\n\n\n\n## Broadcast rights[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n#### National[edit]\n\n\nThis is the seventh year of the current eight-year deals with Fox, ESPN, and TBS. Fox was to televise the MLB at Field of Dreams game on August 13. FS1 televised games on Tuesday nights and on Saturdays both during the afternoon and night. ESPN televised games on its flagship telecast *Sunday Night Baseball* as well as Monday and Wednesday nights. Fox and *ESPN Sunday Night Baseball* telecasts were exclusive; all other national telecasts were subject to local blackout.\n\n\nTBS televised one AL Wild Card Series, both American League Division Series matchups and the American League Championship Series. ESPN televised seven of the eight Wild Card Series with live look-ins and alternate broadcasts on ESPN+.[174][175][176] On September 28, it was announced that ABC would broadcast at least four of ESPN's Wild Card Series games, marking the first time a national MLB game had aired on the network since 1995 (via the ill-fated *The Baseball Network* arrangement).[177] FS1 and MLB Network will televise both National League Division Series matchups. Fox and FS1 televised the National League Championship Series, and the World Series was on Fox for the 21st straight year.\n\n\n\n#### Local[edit]\n\n\n* In Chicago, new television deals resulted in the end of free-to-air regional telecasts for the city's two franchises. In February, the Cubs launched the team-owned Marquee Sports Network, a joint venture with Sinclair Broadcast Group. The White Sox signed exclusively with NBC Sports Chicago under a multi-year deal.[178][179][180]\n* In November 2019, MLB owners voted unanimously to revert \"certain in-market digital [streaming] rights\" to the teams themselves.[181][182]\n* On April 1, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Spectrum SportsNet LA reached a carriage deal with AT&T (covering AT&T TV, U-verse, and DirecTV), concluding a seven-year impasse that had hindered the network's local availability.[183]\n* Long-time Cincinnati Reds television play-by-play announcer Thom Brennaman resigned on September 26 after he was caught using a homophobic slur in a game on August 19 against the Kansas City Royals.[184][185] Sideline host Jim Day took over Brennaman's duties for the rest of the season, beginning August 20.\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n#### National[edit]\n\n\n* ESPN Radio will air its 23rd season of national coverage, including *Sunday Night Baseball*, Saturday Games, Opening Day, Labor Day games, and the entire Major League Baseball postseason.\n\n\n#### Local[edit]\n\n\n* The Oakland Athletics were briefly the first MLB team to abandon terrestrial radio in their primary market in favor of internet radio; the team initially carried games on TuneIn via the \"A's Cast\" channel, with plans for some games to be aired without commercial interruptions. The decision was prompted by competition with other local sports teams for time on stations, resulting in frequent pre-emptions and lowered priorities, and conflicts with regular station programming. The broadcasts were still carried on some terrestrial radio stations outside the Bay Area (with the closest being Sacramento's KHTK).[186][187] However, on July 30, 2020, it was reported that the team had backed out of the arrangement and signed with iHeartMedia to make 960 KNEW the team's flagship station (with its streaming platform shifting to iHeartRadio), beginning July 31. Team president Dave Kaval cited people having become \"budget-conscious\" due to the pandemic as having influenced the decision.[188]\n* Entercom's KMNB/Minneapolis will join WCCO as the FM flagship for the Minnesota Twins in an extension of rights until the 2023 season.[189]\n* Chicago White Sox radio play-by-play announcer Ed Farmer, a former pitcher for the team who had been part of the team's radio broadcast staff since 1991, died on April 1 after a long-term battle with polycystic kidney disease.[190] On June 30, the team and its radio network named Andy Masur (the former pre-game host) as Farmer's successor.[191]\n\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cutout images of Washington Nationals fans placed in Nationals Park seats in August 2020\nIn order to reduce avoidable travel and the amount of personnel on-site for each game, most MLB broadcasters commentated away games remotely from either their broadcaster's studio, or their home stadium's broadcast booths. MLB safety protocols mandated remote broadcasts for away games on television, but radio broadcasters were allowed to be present on-site for away games if they so chose.[192] Some teams had their commentators on-site for home games only, and called away games from their studio.[193][194]\n\n\nFurthermore, the home team's local television rightsholder served as the host broadcaster for each game, providing a neutral video feed to media partners (including the away team's local rightsholder, and in some cases, a national broadcaster), which added commentary, graphics, and other surrounding coverage for their audience.[195][196] MLB Network assisted with providing and using existing infrastructure for this arrangement.[197] Audio from Sony Interactive Entertainment's *MLB: The Show* video game franchise was used as artificial crowd noise for all games, and was played over the stadiums' audio systems on-site.[196]\n\n\nFox announced plans to use augmented reality \"virtual fans\" in its games,[198] while ESPN leveraged experience from its remote broadcasts of KBO League games over the suspended pre-season.[199][200]\n\n\nThe pandemic also led to changes in broadcast arrangements for several teams:\n\n\n\n* Due to health risks, the Baltimore Orioles announced that Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer could not call its games for MASN this season.[201] Local sports radio personality Scott Garceau replaced Thorne on play-by-play; in 2021, the team would not renew the contracts of Thorne, Palmer, or analysts Mike Bordick and Rick Dempsey, with Garceau remaining part of the revamped team.[202]\n* Sportsnet's Toronto Blue Jays color commentator Pat Tabler (who is a U.S. citizen) took on a reduced analyst role this season, leaving the team's alternate commentary team of Dan Shulman (play-by-play) and Buck Martinez (color; he normally performs play-by-play on games where Shulman is not present) for all regular-season games.[193][203] Due to his commitments to ESPN Radio coverage, Shulman was replaced by Joe Siddall for Toronto's Wild Card Series games.[204]\n* Prior to the pandemic, the San Francisco Giants and NBC Sports Bay Area had already planned to have color commentator Mike Krukow broadcast 22 NL West road games remotely from the network's studios (with his play-by-play partner Duane Kuiper commentating on-site as normal) to accommodate his inclusion body myositis, which had made him unfit to travel. The need for this arrangement was ultimately rendered moot, with Krukow and Kuiper calling all Giants' games together from booths at Oracle Park.[192][205]\n* On July 31, Texas Rangers radio voice Matt Hicks tested positive for COVID-19. His partner Eric Nadel subsequently opted out from broadcasting that weekend's games.[206] After television voice C. J. Nitkowski tested positive in mid-September, Fox Sports Southwest switched to using a simulcast of the radio broadcast.[207]\n\n\n## Retirements[edit]\n\n\nThe following players retired during the 2020 season and before the start of 2021 campaign:\n\n\n\n* Alex Wilson \u2013 July 28[208]\n* Jos\u00e9 Reyes \u2013 July 29[209]\n* Chris Iannetta \u2013 August 8[210]\n* Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez \u2013 September 17[211]\n* Alex Gordon \u2013 September 24 retired at the end of the season[212]\n* Hunter Pence \u2013 September 26[213]\n* Francisco Cervelli \u2013 October 3[214]\n* Hisashi Iwakuma \u2013 October 20 retired at the end of the current Nippon Professional Baseball season[215]\n* Kyuji Fujikawa \u2013 November 10[216]\n* Yonder Alonso \u2013 November 20[217]\n* Howie Kendrick \u2013 December 21[218]\n* Phil Hughes \u2013 January 3, 2021[219]\n* Danny Hultzen \u2013 January 14, 2021[220]\n* Daniel Murphy \u2013 January 29, 2021[221]\n* Dustin Pedroia \u2013 February 1, 2021[222]\n* Josh Phegley \u2013 February 3, 2021[223]\n* Jared Hughes \u2013 February 14, 2021[224]\n* Nate Orf \u2013 February 16, 2021[225]\n* Cody Allen \u2013 February 17, 2021[226]\n* Tim Tebow \u2013 February 17, 2021[227]\n* Brian Dozier \u2013 February 18, 2021[228]\n* Kelvin Herrera \u2013 February 26, 2021[229]\n* Tim Dillard \u2013 March 10, 2021[230]\n* Nick Markakis \u2013 March 12, 2021[231]\n* Dan Otero \u2013 March 22[232]\n* Gio Gonzalez \u2013 March 25, 2021[233]\n\n\n## Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\n* Dick Allen had his #15 retired on September 3 by the Philadelphia Phillies. He is the seventh player to have his number retired by the franchise.[234]\n\n\nDue to the delayed start of the season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the following retirement ceremonies have been postponed.

The 118th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros and the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Astros defeated the Phillies in six games to earn their second championship. The series was broadcast in the United States on Fox television and ESPN Radio.[1]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB postseason as the AL West champions and the top-seeded AL team, while the Phillies won a wild card, earning the sixth and final NL playoff berth. The Phillies took a 2\u20131 lead after three games, before the Astros won the final three games to win the series. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first position player to win the award as a rookie.[2]\n\n\nThe series was notable for having the first World Series no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, when Astros pitchers Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly combined to leave the Phillies hitless in Game 4. It was also the third postseason no-hitter in MLB history, after Roy Halladay's no-hitter (also at Citizens Bank Park) in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series.\n\n\nMLB has sold sponsorships to various postseason series since 2017, with YouTube TV serving as the official presenting sponsor of the World Series from 2017 through 2019.[3] The World Series did not have a presenting sponsor in 2020 or 2021, but resumed sponsorship in 2022.[4] As a result of a new multi-year agreement with Capital One, this World Series was officially known as the *2022 World Series presented by Capital One*.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies following their 1980 National League Championship Series[a] encounter, which was won by Philadelphia, 3\u20132, en route to winning the 1980 World Series.[6]\n\n\nHouston and Philadelphia met in the last series of the 2022 MLB season in Houston. Houston won two of the three games, although Philadelphia clinched their postseason berth in the first game with a win.[7] The 19-game gap between the Astros and Phillies is the second largest in World Series history, trailing only the 23-game gap in 1906 between the 93-win Chicago White Sox and the 116-win Chicago Cubs.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Houston Astros season\n\nThis is the fifth World Series appearance for the Astros, and the fourth[a] as the American League team.[11] The Astros qualified for the 2022 postseason as the American League (AL) West division winner.[12] It was their fifth AL West championship in six years and their second straight divisional championship. The Astros entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League. In the Division Series, they swept the fifth-seeded Seattle Mariners. In the American League Championship Series, they swept the second-seeded New York Yankees to make it to the World Series for the fourth time in the previous six seasons (2017, 2019, 2021) and the second consecutive season.[13]\n\n\nHouston's pitching staff led the American League in 2022 with the fewest runs allowed, lowest opponent's batting average and walks plus hits per inning pitched, the most strikeouts, and posted an MLB-best 2.78 bullpen earned run average (ERA).[14] Justin Verlander, who had missed Houston's postseason runs in 2020 and 2021, made his return from Tommy John surgery and led the AL in wins, ERA, and walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio.[15] Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting 6-for-18 (.333) with two home runs and two doubles in the ALCS.[16]\n\n\nDusty Baker, in his 25th season as a major league manager, was seeking his first World Series win as a manager (he won the 1981 World Series as a player with the Dodgers). At 73 years of age, Baker was the oldest manager in World Series history.[17]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Philadelphia Phillies season\n\nThis was the eighth World Series appearance for the Phillies and the first since 2009.[18] The Phillies struggled at the start of the 2022 season. On June 3, and at a record of 22\u201329 (.431), manager Joe Girardi was fired, and Rob Thomson, their bench coach, was named their interim manager.[19] From there, the Phillies went 65\u201346 (.586).[20] They clinched a postseason berth on the third to last day of the season; they were the last postseason team of the 12 to clinch a berth. They qualified for the postseason as the sixth seed wild card entrant with an 87\u201375 (.537) record.[7][21]\n\n\nIn the National League Wild Card Series, they swept the National League Central division winner St. Louis Cardinals, who were ranked third in the National League. In the National League Division Series, they defeated the defending World Series champion and National League East division winner Atlanta Braves in four games, the NL's second seed. In the National League Championship Series (NLCS), they defeated the fifth-seeded San Diego Padres in five games to clinch a World Series berth for the first time since 2009, which the Phillies lost in six games to the New York Yankees.[22] Bryce Harper won the most valuable player award for the NLCS after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs and three doubles.[23] With their third-place finish, the Phillies were the first team to finish in third place in their division to advance to a World Series since the 1981 New York Yankees.[24]\n\n\nDave Dombrowski, the Phillies' president of baseball operations, made his fifth World Series appearance. Dombrowski is the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.[25]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Houston won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 28 | **Philadelphia Phillies** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 5 (10) | Minute Maid Park | 4:34 | 42,903[26] |\n| 2 | October 29 | Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 2, **Houston Astros** \u2013 5 | Minute Maid Park | 3:18 | 42,926[27] |\n| 3 | November 1\u2020 | Houston Astros \u2013 0, **Philadelphia Phillies** \u2013 7 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:08 | 45,712[28] |\n| 4 | November 2 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 5, Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 0 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:25 | 45,693[29] |\n| 5 | November 3 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 3, Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 2 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:57 | 45,693[30] |\n| 6 | November 5 | Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 1, **Houston Astros** \u2013 4 | Minute Maid Park | 3:13 | 42,958[31] |\n\n\n\u2020 Game 3 was postponed from October 31, due to rain; consequently, all subsequent games were postponed by one day from the original schedule.\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)J.

Realmuto hit the game-winning home run of Game 1 in the 10th inning for the Phillies.\n\n\nOctober 28, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Philadelphia** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Luis Garc\u00eda (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** David Robertson (1)**Home runs:**PHI: J. T. Realmuto (1)HOU: Kyle Tucker 2 (2)**Attendance:** 42,903Boxscore |\n\n\nThis was the first World Series since 1915 to begin on a Friday.[32][33] Prior to Game 1, Eric Burton of the band Black Pumas sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".[34] Terry Puhl threw the ceremonial first pitch and Simone Biles called \"play ball!\".[35] Justin Verlander started for the Astros while Aaron Nola started for the Phillies.[36]\n\n\nKyle Tucker hit a solo home run off of Nola in the bottom of the second inning. Nola then gave up two singles to Yuli Gurriel and Chas McCormick.[37] With runners at the corners, Mart\u00edn Maldonado hit a run batted in single scoring Gurriel. Jos\u00e9 Altuve grounded into a double play to end the inning. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a doubled to start the third for Houston and Alex Bregman drew a walk. Tucker hit a three-run home run into the Astros bullpen to give Houston a 5\u20130 lead. Verlander took a no-hit bid into the top of the fourth inning when he gave up a single to Rhys Hoskins. Bryce Harper singled, moving Hoskins to third. Nick Castellanos drove in Hoskins with a single, and Alec Bohm drove in Harper and Castellanos with a double down the left-field line to trim the lead to two.[37] In the top of the fifth inning, Verlander gave up a leadoff double to Brandon Marsh, and walked Kyle Schwarber. J. T. Realmuto hit a double off the base of the wall to score both runners and tie the game at five. Realmuto advanced to third on a Harper groundout, but Verlander struck out Castellanos, ending the inning.[37] At the top of the sixth, Nola was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Alvarado, who retired the side.[37]\n\n\nThe game remained tied through nine innings, and entered extra innings. In the top of the tenth inning, Realmuto hit a solo home run off Luis Garc\u00eda to give the Phillies a one-run lead. After a Harper single and a Bryson Stott walk, Garc\u00eda was taken out of the game and replaced with Ryne Stanek, who was able to get out of the inning. In the bottom of the tenth inning, David Robertson struck out Yordan \u00c1lvarez before giving up a double to Bregman.[38] Tucker tipped off a fair ball that bounced in front of home plate and was thrown out at first. Robertson walked Gurriel, bringing pinch hitter Aledmys D\u00edaz to the plate. Robertson threw a wild pitch to advance the runners to second and third. After working the count to 2\u20131, D\u00edaz was hit on the elbow by Robertson and started toward first base. However, the home plate umpire ruled that D\u00edaz had leaned into the pitch, resulting in ball three. On the next pitch, D\u00edaz grounded out, ending the game.[38] It was the first time since 2002 that a team had overcome a five-run deficit to win a World Series game, when the San Francisco Giants \u2013 also managed by Dusty Baker \u2013 blew such a lead in Game 6.[39]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Bregman hit a home run in the fifth inning of Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 29, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **Houston** | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 5 | 7 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Zack Wheeler (0\u20131)**Home runs:**PHI: NoneHOU: Alex Bregman (1)**Attendance:** 42,926Boxscore |\n\n\nLittle Big Town performed the national anthem before Game 2. Craig Biggio threw the ceremonial first pitch to Jeff Bagwell, and Bun B called \"play ball!\".[35] Framber Valdez started for Houston and Zack Wheeler started for Philadelphia.[40]\n\n\nIn the first inning, Jeremy Pe\u00f1a hit an RBI double to score Jose Altuve for the first run. Yordan \u00c1lvarez followed with the third straight double to bring in the second run for the Astros. With that hit, Houston became the first World Series team to start a game with three straight extra-base hits. Alvarez scored the third run on an error. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Alex Bregman hit a two-run home to left field to make the score 5\u20130. Nick Castellanos scored the first run for the Phillies on a sacrifice fly by Jean Segura in the seventh inning to make it 5\u20131. In the top of the eighth inning, Kyle Schwarber hit a foul ball that was initially ruled a two-run home run, which would have made the score 5\u20133. Schwarber ended up flying out deep to right on the next pitch, again just missing a home run.[41] In the top of the ninth inning, Alec Bohm scored on an error by first baseman Yuli Gurriel to make it 5\u20132, which proved to be the final score.[42]\n\n\nGame 2 was also notable for umpire Pat Hoberg calling a \"perfect game\" with 129 of 129 pitches called correctly. Hoberg received widespread praise from both fans and the press for this accomplishment.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bryce Harper hit the first of five home runs for the Phillies in Game 3.\n\n\nNovember 1, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Philadelphia** | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 7 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Ranger Su\u00e1rez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Lance McCullers Jr. (0\u20131)**Home runs:**HOU: NonePHI: Bryce Harper (1), Alec Bohm (1), Brandon Marsh (1), Kyle Schwarber (1), Rhys Hoskins (1)**Attendance:** 45,712Boxscore |\n\n\nOriginally scheduled for October 31, Game 3 was postponed to November 1 due to rain. Every following game was pushed back one day.[45] Bernie Parent, Mike Schmidt, Julius Erving, and Brandon Graham threw ceremonial first pitches,[46] and Chloe Bailey sang the national anthem.[47] Ranger Su\u00e1rez started for Philadelphia, taking the place of Noah Syndergaard, who would have started if it had not been postponed.[48] Lance McCullers Jr. started for Houston.[49]\n\n\nIn the bottom of the first, Kyle Schwarber drew a walk, and Bryce Harper hit a two-run home run to right field. Alec Bohm and Brandon Marsh hit solo home runs for the Phillies in the second.[50] Bohm's solo home run to left field in the second inning marked the 1,000th home run in World Series history.[51] When Marsh also homered in that inning, the Phillies became the first team to hit three home runs in the first two innings of a World Series game. In the bottom of the fifth, Schwarber hit a two-run home run to dead center, and Rhys Hoskins hit a solo home run to left, making the Phillies the fourth team to hit a record five home runs in a single World Series game, joining the 1928 Yankees (Game 4 of the 1928 World Series), 1989 Athletics (Game 3 of the 1989 World Series), and 2017 Astros (Game 5 of the 2017 World Series); they are also the only team of these four to go on to lose the World Series. Furthermore, McCullers became the first pitcher in history to surrender five home runs in a postseason game.[52][53] Ryne Stanek relieved McCullers after Hoskins' home run. Su\u00e1rez came out of the game after throwing five scoreless innings. Connor Brogdon, Kyle Gibson, Nick Nelson, and Andrew Bellatti each pitched a scoreless inning to complete the shutout as the Phillies won 7\u20130. All seven runs were scored via a home run.[54]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Pressly *(pictured in 2013 with the Minnesota Twins)* completed the combined no-hitter in Game 4.\n\n\nNovember 2, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 62\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Cristian Javier (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Aaron Nola (0\u20131)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nJimmy Rollins and Chase Utley threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 4 and *American Idol* contestant Madison Watkins sang the national anthem; Utley's pitch was caught by Rob McElhenney and Rollins' by Miles Teller.[55] An additional first pitch was thrown out by a 19-year-old cancer survivor; Jill Biden was on hand to support Stand Up to Cancer in the middle of the fifth inning.[56] Aaron Nola made his second start of the series for the Phillies, while Cristian Javier started for the Astros.[57] The Astros and Phillies remained scoreless through four innings. The Astros loaded the bases in the top of the fifth inning against Nola. Jos\u00e9 Alvarado relieved Nola and hit Yordan \u00c1lvarez with a pitch, scoring the game's first run and breaking a 16-innings scoreless streak for Houston. The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-run double, Kyle Tucker followed with a sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel singled to score Bregman.[58]\n\n\nJavier pitched six innings on 97 pitches without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters, and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning. Rafael Montero pitched a hitless eighth inning for the Astros. Ryan Pressly, the Astros closer, pitched in the ninth inning for the Astros, only allowing a one-out walk to Kyle Schwarber, to complete the no-hitter. It was the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and the second no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.[59] It was also the third no-hitter in postseason history, after Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter for the Phillies in the 2010 National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Coincidentally, both no-hitters took place at Citizens Bank Park, and Dusty Baker was involved as a manager in both as he had managed the Reds in 2010.[60]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justin Verlander earned his first career World Series win in Game 5.\n\n\nNovember 3, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Justin Verlander (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Noah Syndergaard (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (1)**Home runs:**HOU: Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (1)PHI: Kyle Schwarber (2)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore Game 5, Meek Mill performed a song on the field and rode with the Phillie Phanatic on an ATV.[61] Philadelphia native Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem[62] and Brad Lidge threw the ceremonial first pitch to Carlos Ruiz.[63] Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies[64] and Justin Verlander started for the Astros.[65] The Phillies donned powder blue throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange jerseys.[66]\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve led off the game with a double, advanced to third base on an error, and scored on a single by Jeremy Pe\u00f1a. Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run to tie it. Schwarber's home run was the tenth given up by Verlander in the World Series, passing Catfish Hunter for the most allowed in World Series history.[67] Pe\u00f1a hit a home run to put the Astros ahead at 2\u20131 in the fourth inning, becoming the first rookie shortstop to hit a home run in the World Series. The Phillies, who had put runners in scoring position throughout the next four innings, did not score another run off of Verlander, who finished his appearance with six strikeouts and four walks allowed in five innings. In the top of the eighth inning, Altuve scored from third base on a ground out by Yordan \u00c1lvarez, widening the Astros' lead to 3\u20131. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Nick Castellanos scored on an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Phillies' deficit and putting runners on the corners. Ryan Pressly entered to try for a five-out save, his fourth appearance in the series. He recorded a strikeout and a hard-hit groundout to Trey Mancini to end the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, Chas McCormick made a leaping catch at the right-center wall on a flyball hit by J. T. Realmuto for the second out, preventing a likely extra-base hit. The next batter, Bryce Harper, was hit by a pitch, putting the tying run on first base, but Castellanos hit a groundball to short that led to the game-ending putout from Pe\u00f1a to Mancini to end the game. The victory was the first World Series pitching win of Verlander's career, who had gone 0\u20136 in his previous eight World Series starts, including Game 1.[68]\n\n\nThe change in the World Series schedule due to rain meant Game 5 went up directly against a *Thursday Night Football* game between the NFL franchises of both World Series cities, in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Houston Texans, 29\u201317. Estimates from Nielsen Media Research showed the baseball game drew an average of five million more viewers, with a share of at least 50 in both Philadelphia and Houston. Meanwhile, the football game, originally scheduled to air on the Fox affiliates in both markets per NFL rules, moved to the MyNetworkTV affiliates in both markets.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit a home run to center field, to a distance estimated at 450 feet, to give the Astros the lead in Game 6.\n\n\nNovember 5, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Zack Wheeler (0\u20132) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (2)**Home runs:**PHI: Kyle Schwarber (3)HOU: Yordan \u00c1lvarez (1)**Attendance:** 42,958Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 6 set the record for the latest date that a World Series game has been played. The latest a World Series game had previously been played was November 4, in both 2001 and 2009.[71] The Astros replaced Yuli Gurriel, who exited Game 5 with a knee injury, on their roster with Korey Lee.[72] Gallery Furniture's Jim McIngvale threw the ceremonial first pitch, Andy Grammer sang the national anthem, and George Strait called \"play ball!\" In a rematch from Game 2, Framber Valdez started for the Astros, while Zack Wheeler started for the Phillies.[73]\n\n\nThe game remained scoreless through five innings before Kyle Schwarber hit a solo home run to right field for the Phillies in the top of the sixth inning. Wheeler allowed Jose Altuve and Jeremy Pe\u00f1a to reach base and was relieved by Jos\u00e9 Alvarado in preparation for Yordan \u00c1lvarez. Alvarado then gave up a three-run home run to \u00c1lvarez.[74] Later in the inning, Christian V\u00e1zquez hit an RBI single, allowing Alex Bregman to score. Pressly pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his sixth save of playoffs, with Nick Castellanos flying out to Kyle Tucker in foul territory for the final out and season's conclusion.\n\n\nManager Dusty Baker won his first career Fall Classic victory as a manager (after 3,884 games managed, a record for a first-time winner) and Houston was the first team since the Red Sox in 2013 to officially clinch the championship in their home stadium (the Dodgers won as the home team in 2020, but that was played at a neutral site due to the COVID-19 pandemic).[75] Pe\u00f1a, who was 2-for-4 in Game 6, won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He batted 10-for-25 (.400) with one home run in the series. Pe\u00f1a became the first-position player (and the third player overall) to win the award in his rookie season.[76] In total for the postseason, the Houston bullpen allowed five total runs over 54+1\u20443 innings for an ERA of 0.83, becoming the first team to throw at least 40 postseason innings of the bullpen with an ERA below 1.00 in major league history.[77] The Astros became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing the previous year, with the last having been the Kansas City Royals in 2015.[78]\n\n\nWith the win, the Astros finished 11\u20132 in the postseason, the fourth team to win a World Series while losing fewer than three games in the Wild Card era after the 1998 New York Yankees (11\u20132), the 1999 New York Yankees (11\u20131), and the 2005 Chicago White Sox (11\u20131).[79]\n\n\n\n### Composite line score[edit]\n\n\n2022 World Series (4\u20132): **Houston Astros** beat Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia Phillies | 3 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 18 | 31 | 3\n |\n| **Houston Astros** | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 7 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 48 | 2\n |\n| **Home runs:**PHI: Kyle Schwarber (3), Alec Bohm (1), Bryce Harper (1), Rhys Hoskins (1), Brandon Marsh (1), J.

Play-by-play announcer Joe Davis called the event for the first time, succeeding Joe Buck following the latter's departure from the network after 25 years as its lead World Series voice.[81] Davis was joined by Baseball Hall of Famer John Smoltz as color analyst, and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, and David Ortiz.[82]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, MLB Network produced an international feed through MLB International,[83] which aired on Sportsnet in Canada,[84] BT Sport in the United Kingdom,[85] and ESPN in Australia.[86] Dave Flemming called the play-by-play of the games for Anglophone viewers, with Dan Plesac as color analyst.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nAudience includes Fox and Fox Deportes\n\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 5.69 | 11.68 | [87][88] |\n| 2\n | 5.34 | 10.99 | [89][88] |\n| 3\n | 6.11 | 11.37 | [90][91] |\n| 4\n | 6.48 | 12.06 | [92][91] |\n| 5\n | 6.92 | 13.01 | [93][91] |\n| 6\n | 6.11 | 12.87 | [94][91] |\n\n\n*Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.*\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFor the 25th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States. Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo P\u00e9rez as color analysts and Buster Olney as field reporter. Kevin Winter and Doug Glanville hosted the pregame coverage.[95] This was Shulman's 12th and final World Series broadcast for ESPN Radio, with Jon Sciambi succeeding him in 2023.[96][97]\n\n\nTUDN Radio broadcast the series in Spanish, with an announcing crew including Jes\u00fas Acostas, Enrique Burak, Alberto Ferreiro, Jos\u00e9 Luis N\u00e1poles, Luis Eduardo Qui\u00f1ones and Antonio de Valdes.[98] The flagship radio stations for both teams broadcast the series locally. In Philadelphia, WIP-FM and WTTM aired the games in English and in Spanish respectively, while KBME and KLAT did so in Houston.[98] During the Phillies-Eagles conflict for Game 5, WIP-FM aired the Eagles game while the Phillies aired on KYW and WPHT.[99]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe 2022 World Series was sponsored by Capital One, the credit card provider, as part of a new multi-year agreement. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.[4]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Houston[edit]\n\n\nShortly after his contract expired after the 2022 World Series, James Click rejected a one-year contract offer from the Astros and the team announced that they would move on without Click.[100] Click became the first GM since 1947 to leave an MLB franchise this quickly after winning the World Series. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan covered the shocking departure, characterizing owner Jim Crane as extremely hands-on and at odds with Click\u2019s management style.[101] \u201cSometimes I wonder if [Crane] thinks he\u2019s Jerry Jones,\u201d one Astros employee told Passan. The The Astros hired Atlanta Braves scout Dana Brown as their general manager on January 26, 2023.[102] A few week later, the Toronto Blue Jays hired James Click to be the vice president of baseball strategy. Additionally, with Click's departure, former Astros star Jeff Bagwell gained more power within the organization.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Astros won the AL West in 2023, but they did not do it in dominant fashion like their teams' from 2017-2019 and 2021-2022. Injuries and poor performance to their rotation saw the team trade young prospects for Justin Verlander at the trade deadline, who had signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets in the off-season.[105] Overall, they finished tied with the Texas Rangers in first-place in the AL West, but won the tie-breaker thus giving them the division. However, in the postseason, the Astros were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, with the visitor winning all seven games on the road similar to the 2019 World Series. After the season, Dusty Baker retired as manager.[106]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nThree months later, the Philadelphia Eagles lost in Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs, suffering the third championship defeat of a Philadelphia sports team in as many months following the Union and the Phillies losses.[107] Philadelphia was the first sports city in history to lose three straight professional sports championship games in one season.[108][109]\n\n\nAfter the season, Bryce Harper underwent Tommy John surgery for his ligament tear. Despite big free agent signings such as Trea Turner and Taijuan Walker, the Phillies started off similarly in 2023 as they did in 2022, particularly without Harper until May, finishing with a sub .500 record at the start of June. They would go 65\u201342 from June until the rest of the season and finish as the first wildcard. They would again defeat the NL East-winning Atlanta Braves in the NLDS before being upset loss by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2022 Japan Series\n* 2022 Korean Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Houston Astros were members of the National League until the 2013 season.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Harrigan, Thomas (November 6, 2022). \"MLB announces 2022 playoff schedule\". *mlb.com*.

The Astros entered the season as both the defending AL and AL West champions, and they looked to avenge their 2021 World Series loss to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\n\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) expired on December 1, 2021. With no new agreement in place, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced a lockout of players the following day. On March 10, 2022, MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new CBA, thus ending the lockout. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, instead took place on April 7, and a full 162-game season was played.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Regular season accomplishments\n |\n| --- |\n| Regular season accomplishments[edit]\nWith a 106-win season in 2022, the Astros became the first major league team to reach 100 wins four times in a six-year span. Over the previous fifty seasons, they had tallied five 100-win seasons, tying the Los Angeles Dodgers and trailing only the Atlanta Braves (7) and New York Yankees (10).[224]\nThe following accomplishments were rate-statistic qualifying records for a 162-game season, and in second place inclusive of all qualifying seasons:\n* Astros pitching registered a 2.90 earned run average (ERA), a franchise record over a 162-game season, Only the 1981 club posted a lower ERA, at 2.66, over an entire season, which was shortened to 110 games due to the players\u2019 strike.[225] Maldonado was recognized with the 2022 Darryl Kile Award due in large part to his work handling the pitching staff.[226]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB season as runners-up in the 2021 World Series championship, falling to the Atlanta Braves in six games. It was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, including a route to their fifth consecutive American League (AL) Championship Series. They had won the AL West division with 95\u201367 record, their fourth division championship in five seasons.\n\n\n\n#### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 2021, the day following the ending of the World Series, seven Astros were declared free agents, including Carlos Correa, Yimi Garc\u00eda, Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez, Kendall Graveman, Zack Greinke, Brooks Raley, and Justin Verlander.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHouston Astros 2022 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 2 Alex Bregman\n3 Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (ALCS & World Series MVP)\n9 Christian V\u00e1zquez\n10 Yuli Gurriel\n14 Mauricio Dub\u00f3n\n15 Mart\u00edn Maldonado\n16 Aledmys D\u00edaz\n17 David Hensley\n20 Chas McCormick\n26 Trey Mancini\n27 Jos\u00e9 Altuve\n30 Kyle Tucker\n35 Justin Verlander (AL CYA)\n38 Korey Lee\n43 Lance McCullers\n44 Yordan \u00c1lvarez\n45 Ryne Stanek\n47 Rafael Montero\n50 H\u00e9ctor Neris\n51 Will Smith\n52 Bryan Abreu\n53 Cristian Javier\n55 Ryan Pressly\n58 Hunter Brown\n59 Framber Valdez\n65 Jos\u00e9 Urquidy\n77 Luis Garc\u00eda\n |\n| Manager\n12 Dusty Baker\nCoaches\nBench 19 Joe Espada\nFirst base 22 Omar L\u00f3pez\nThird base 8 Gary Pettis\nHitting 37 Alex Cintr\u00f3n\nAssistant Hitting 46 Troy Snitker\nPitching 41 Bill Murphy\nBullpen 36 Josh Miller\nQuality control 54 Dan Firova\nCatching Coach 29 Michael Collins\nBullpen catcher 85 Javier Bracamonte\n |\n| Regular season\nAmerican League Division Series\nAmerican League Championship Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

On November 5, they beat the Phillies 4-1 in Game 6 at Minute Maid Park to win their second world championship and first since 2017. A historic bullpen that allowed just five earned runs all postseason was boosted by contributions by players such as Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (ALCS and World Series MVP) and Yordan Alvarez (who had go-ahead home runs in three of the eleven Astro postseason wins). Dusty Baker earned his first championship as a manager with the win. The Astros became the first team to have a winning percentage of .622 (or better) in a six-season span (2017-2022) with multiple World Series titles since the 1953-1958 New York Yankees, and they became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing it the previous year.\n[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Summary of Astros' offseason[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMajor League Baseball announced merchandising sales records established by Astros team sh0ps during the 2022 World Series. During Games 1 the Astros' nine retail outlets within Union Station and Minute Maid Park recorded the highest single-day merchandise sale total in World Series history, surpassing those during an 18-inning contest at Dodger Stadium between the Red Sox and Dodgers in 2018. Game 2 achieved the second-highest total on record. Thus, the Astros held the four highest sales totals during the World Series, to include both Games 1 of the 2019 and 2021 World Series.[248]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBehind a three-home-run game from \u00c1lvarez and five hitless innings from Verlander on September 16, the Astros secured a sixth consecutive playoff berth \u2014 also their seventh in the last eight seasons. On September 19, the Astros clinched the AL West, their fifth division title in the last six seasons. This made them the first team to win the AL West five times in six years since the Anaheim Angels from 2004 to 2009. They swept Seattle in the Division Series to reach the AL Championship Series (ALCS) for a sixth straight season, in doing so becoming the first team in major league history to win a postseason series in six consecutive seasons.[2] They swept the New York Yankees in the ALCS and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games in the World Series, becoming just the third team after the 1995 Atlanta Braves and the 2019 Washington Nationals to sweep the LCS since it became a best-of-seven-game series and subsequently win the World Series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Astros won, 7\u20135, to sweep the doubleheader and win the season series, 5\u20132.[134] Per ESPN Stats and Info, the Yankees hit .151 (33-for-229) in the seven games versus Astros pitching, the lowest mark in franchise history with at least five games played against one opponent in a single season. New York had the best record in baseball and were on pace to win 110 games.[135]\n**July 22\u201324 at Seattle Mariners: Houston won series, 3\u20130**\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSources\n1. **^** McTaggart, Brian (June 25, 2022). \"Javier (13 K's) leads Houston's 'shocking' combined no-hitter vs. Yanks\". *MLB.com*.

Reliever Will Smith joined Joc Pederson, Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist as the only players to win back 2 back World Series' on two different teams.\nDuring the Astros' championship run, the Astros bullpen became the first to hurl at least 40 innings and allow an ERA of less than 1.00 (0.83), per ESPN Stats & Info, and also surpassed the 1973 Oakland Athletics (1.05) for lowest with a minimum 35 innings, per MLB.com.[260]\nAs a result of the Astros' championship season, furniture store owner \"Mattress Mack\" Jim McIngvale was awarded $75 million in total sports betting payouts\u2014the highest total in sports betting history\u2014from a total of $10 million placed earlier in the season.[261]\n\nGame 1, October 28 at Minute Maid Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPursuant to the new CBA, several new rules were instituted for the 2022 season. The National League adopted the designated hitter full-time, a draft lottery was implemented, postseason eligibility was expanded from ten teams to twelve, and advertising patches appeared on player uniforms and helmets for the first time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Spring Training[edit]\n\n\nTwo players continued recovery from injuries sustained in the 2021 American League Division Series (ALDS) and missed the start of the regular season with estimated return dates uncertain. Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. (right forearm strain)[18] was still unable to throw in spring training.[19] Jake Meyers, who torn the labrum in his left shoulder, underwent surgery following the conclusion of the World Series.[20] Forrest Whitley, on the Astros' 40-man roster, was recovering from Tommy John surgery as of the start of the 2022 season.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**September 27\u201328 vs Arizona Diamondbacks: Houston split series with ARI, 1\u20131**\nOn September 27, Jos\u00e9 Altuve hit two of the Astros' five home runs as Houston won the opener of a two-game set, 10\u20132.

Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit a two-run double in the third inning, and Yuli Gurriel and Alex Bregman later homered to cut the Mariners' lead to 7\u20135 through eight innings. \u00c1lvarez also threw out France at home plate in the fourth inning. In the bottom of the ninth, David Hensley, making his postseason debut as a pinch hitter, was hit by a Paul Sewald delivery, before Jeremy Pe\u00f1a reached with a single. Lefty Robbie Ray relieved Sewald with two outs, and the left-handed-hitting \u00c1lvarez hit a three-run walk-off home run to secure an 8\u20137 win for the Astros.

The Phillies got the scoring started with a 2-out, 2-run homer from Bryce Harper and never looked back, getting homers from Alec Bohm, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber and Rhys Hoskins to back starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez. Bohm's home run represented a milestone in World Series history as the 1,000th hit all-time. The five home runs represented another milestone and record, albeit dubiously for McCullers, who became the first pitcher to allow that many in a World Series contest. Su\u00e1rez, who worked 5 scoreless innings and struck out four, was the winning pitcher as Philadelphia mounted a 2\u20131 Series lead.[249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| June\n |\n| --- |\n| June[edit]\nThe Astros won their fourth game in row on June 1.

Elvis Andrus hit an RBI double to end Verlander's no-hit bit, tying the game at 1, and Christian Bethancourt succeeded with a two-run home run. Houston answered with four ninth inning runs, including a bases loaded double by Alvarez. Verlander received a no-decision and Bryan Abreu (3\u20130) produced a scoreless eighth inning.

After trailing by five runs in opener versus the Royals, \u00c1lvarez provided a second consecutive walk-off. Starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi struggled with command, unable to get ahead of hitters, to induce swings and misses, or weak contact. The Astros found themselves in a 5\u20130 deficit after three innings. MJ Melendez homered twice for Kansa City, including once versus Odorizzi, whose afternoon concluded after four innings and 90 pitches. Houston starters had yielded a 0.67 ERA and the staff 10 earned runs overall in the previous ten contests. The Astros scored once each in the fourth, fifth and seventh innings. In the eighth, Royals reliever Amir Garrett walked two of three batters he faced before both runners scored on a Kyle Tucker single to center field. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n353. **^** \"MLB player pitching stats 2022\". *ESPN.com*.

Jeremy Pe\u00f1a homered in the first inning for Houston, who had won five in a row in the since the All-Star break, and were an AL-leading 28\u201310 since June 12.[141] Chad Pinder hit his second grand slam in two weeks as the A's held on to defeat the Astros, 5\u20133, on July 26. Kyle Tucker hit his 19th home run and Yordan \u00c1lvarez collected two hits for the Astros.[142] The A's also won the series' final game on July 27, 4\u20132, for their first sweep of the season. \u00c1lvarez hit his 29th home of the season. Tony Kemp tallied another strong game, collecting three hits and one RBI.

The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-RBI double, Kyle Tucker followed with an RBI sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel hit a single to score Bregman. Javier threw six innings without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning.

A home run to Shohei Ohtani in the first inning was the only baserunner that Javier (6\u20133) allowed aboard. The 14 strikeouts established another new career high, and the 27 counting those from the previous start made Javier the only pitcher in the modern era to achieve that number of strikeouts in a span of two starts while allowing one or fewer hits. He was the fourth pitcher in franchise history to attain 13 or more strikeouts in consecutive starts, and the first since Gerrit Cole in 2019. In the sixth inning, Chas McCormick made a key leaping catch in front of the left field wall to rob Andrew Velazquez of a hit.
