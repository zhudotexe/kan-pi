The ensemble was originally referred to as the \"**Not Ready for Prime Time Players**\".[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Complete list[edit]\n\n\nThe list below includes both repertory and featured players past and present, but omits *SNL* writers and others who were not listed as cast members during the show's credits. The dates given are those of the years they were part of the cast. The chart also shows whether the cast member has served as a guest host, appeared as the anchorperson of the \"Weekend Update\" segment (by any of its titles), or has been the subject of their own \"Best of\" home video collection. Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983. \n\n\n\n### Table[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTable of *Saturday Night Live* cast members\n| Performer\n | Time on *SNL* | No. of seasons\n | Repertory Player\n | Featured Player\n | Middle Group\n | \"Weekend Update\" Anchor\n | Hosted\n | Best\u00a0of... | Writer |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fred Armisen | 2002\u20132013 | 11\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Aristotle Athari | 2021\u20132022 | 1\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Dan Aykroyd | 1975\u20131979 | 4\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Peter Aykroyd | 1980 | 1\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Morwenna Banks | 1995 | 1\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Vanessa Bayer | 2010\u20132017 | 7\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Jim Belushi | 1983\u20131985 | 2\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| John Belushi | 1975\u20131979 | 4\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Beck Bennett | 2013\u20132021 | 8\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Jim Breuer | 1995\u20131998 | 3\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Paul Brittain | 2010\u20132012 | 2\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| A.

Bush during 2003. He, Joe Piscopo, and Phil Hartman are the only cast members to have portrayed two sitting presidents. Jason Sudeikis portrayed two sitting presidents, but the portrayal of the second president was performed as a host, rather than a cast member.\n\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush grew fond of Dana Carvey's impersonation of him. Carvey was invited to headline a White House Christmas party in 1992, during the lame duck period after Bush had lost the election.[13] Two years later, on October 22, 1994, when Carvey hosted the show for the first time, Bush appeared in pre-recorded videos, in both the cold open and the opening monologue, critiquing Carvey's impersonation of him.[14][15]\n\n\nPresidents are not usually portrayed on *Saturday Night Live* after they leave office. Exceptions are limited to the portrayal of former president Richard Nixon who left office prior to the launch of the show in 1975, Bill Clinton who appeared in sketches related to the presidential campaigns of his wife, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump who continued to be politically active after leaving office. Dan Aykroyd portrayed Nixon from 1975\u201379, and Darrell Hammond portrayed Nixon on episode 12 of season 34. James Austin Johnson portrayed Trump in several episodes of season 47.[16]\n\n\n\n### Impersonation of Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saturday Night Live parodies of Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump, having been a public figure before being president, was portrayed by several cast members over the years. He was portrayed by Phil Hartman (1988\u20131990), Darrell Hammond (1999\u20132011, 2015\u20132016), Jason Sudeikis (2012) and Taran Killam (2015). Alec Baldwin started impersonating Trump as a guest during the 42nd season of *SNL* in late 2016, when Trump was the Republican nominee during the 2016 United States presidential elections. Baldwin continued with the guest impersonations of Trump after the elections when Trump was president-elect, as well as after Trump was sworn in as president. Baldwin continued to impersonate Trump throughout Trump's presidency.\n\n\nAlec Baldwin's impersonation of Donald Trump earned him an Emmy award in 2017, in spite of his public declaration that he \"loathes the role.\" At the end of Season 44, Baldwin publicly announced that he will cease impersonating Trump, but changed his mind prior to the beginning of Season 45 after *SNL* executive producer Lorne Michaels convinced him to continue with the impersonation. [17][18] Following the 2020 presidential elections in which Trump lost re-election, Baldwin tweeted \"I don't believe I've ever been this overjoyed to lose a job before!\"[19]\n\n\nTrump has criticized Baldwin's portrayal on multiple occasions. In response, Baldwin taunted Trump with statements such as \"release your tax returns and I'll stop.\"[20] In June 2021, after Trump had left office, it was reported that while Trump was in office he had inquired if the Federal Communications Commission or the United States Justice Department could force *SNL* to stop portraying him. Trump denied that he has ever made such an inquiry, but claimed that his portrayal by *SNL* \"should be considered an illegal campaign contribution from the Democrat Party.\" He also criticized Baldwin's portrayal of him, but praised Darrell Hammond's portrayal of him.[21]\n\n\n\n## Returning to host[edit]\n\n\nSeveral former *SNL* cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).\n\n\nEddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show. There was a 35 year and 6 day gap between his second and third hosting of the show.\n\n\nAdam Sandler and Dan Aykroyd tie the record of the longest gap between leaving the show as a cast member and returning as a host. Both hosted the show for the first time nine days shy of 24 years from last appearance as cast. However, both made appearances on the show during the gap. On the flip side, Bill Murray holds the record for having the shortest gap between leaving the show and returning to host at 287 days after leaving the cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Saturday Night Live* cast members who have hosted\n| Host\n | Number ofepisodes\n | First hosted\n | Last hosted\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fred Armisen | 1\n | May 21, 2016\n |\n| Dan Aykroyd | 1\n | May 17, 2003\n |\n| Dana Carvey | 4 | October 22, 1994 | February 5, 2011\n |\n| Chevy Chase | 8[22] | February 18, 1978 | February 15, 1997\n |\n| Billy Crystal | 2 | March 17, 1984 | May 12, 1984\n |\n| Pete Davidson | 1\n | October 14, 2023[23] |\n| Robert Downey Jr. | 1\n | November 16, 1996\n |\n| Jimmy Fallon | 3 | December 17, 2011 | April 15, 2017\n |\n| Chris Farley | 1\n | October 25, 1997\n |\n| Will Ferrell | 5 | May 14, 2005 | November 23, 2019\n |\n| Tina Fey | 6 | February 23, 2008 | May 19, 2018\n |\n| Will Forte | 1\n | January 22, 2022\n |\n| Bill Hader | 2 | October 11, 2014 | March 17, 2018\n |\n| Phil Hartman | 2 | March 23, 1996 | November 23, 1996\n |\n| Julia Louis-Dreyfus | 3 | May 13, 2006 | April 16, 2016\n |\n| Jon Lovitz | 1\n | November 8, 1997\n |\n| Norm Macdonald | 1\n | October 23, 1999\n |\n| Michael McKean | 1\n | November 3, 1984\n |\n| Seth Meyers | 1\n | October 13, 2018\n |\n| Tracy Morgan | 2 | March 14, 2009 | October 17, 2015\n |\n| Eddie Murphy | 3 | December 11, 1982 | December 21, 2019\n |\n| Bill Murray | 5 | March 7, 1981 | February 20, 1999\n |\n| Mike Myers | 1\n | March 22, 1997\n |\n| Don Novello | 2 | January 14, 1984 | May 12, 1984\n |\n| Amy Poehler | 2 | September 25, 2010 | December 19, 2015\n |\n| Chris Rock | 3 | November 2, 1996 | October 3, 2020\n |\n| Maya Rudolph | 2 | February 18, 2012 | March 27, 2021\n |\n| Andy Samberg | 1\n | May 17, 2014\n |\n| Adam Sandler | 1\n | May 4, 2019\n |\n| Paul Shaffer | 1\n | January 31, 1987\n |\n| Molly Shannon | 2\n | May 12, 2007\n | April 8, 2023\n |\n| Martin Short | 4 | December 6, 1986 | December 10, 2022\n |\n| Sarah Silverman | 1\n | October 4, 2014\n |\n| David Spade | 2 | November 7, 1998 | March 12, 2005\n |\n| Jason Sudeikis | 1\n | October 23, 2021\n |\n| Ben Stiller | 2 | October 24, 1998 | October 8, 2011\n |\n| Damon Wayans | 1\n | April 8, 1995\n |\n| Kristen Wiig | 4 | May 11, 2013 | December 19, 2020\n |\n\n\n## The \"*SNL* Curse\"[edit]\n\n\nAlthough *SNL* is best known as the launchpad for many successful careers, eight former cast members have died before the age of 60. This has given rise to a superstition known as the \"*Saturday Night Live* Curse\".[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegedly \"cursed\" *Saturday Night Live* cast members\n| Cast member\n | Age\n | Date of death\n | Cause of death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Belushi | 33 | March 5, 1982 | Belushi died of a drug overdose from a speedball injection (cocaine and heroin). His death led to the conviction of Cathy Smith for administering the fatal injection.\n |\n| Gilda Radner | 42 | May 20, 1989 | Radner died from ovarian cancer. She was originally scheduled to host the season 13 finale, a first for a former female cast member. However, *SNL* was canceled due to a 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Radner's health worsened the following year. Moments before the season 14 finale, news broke of Radner's death. In lieu of the opening monologue Steve Martin, visibly shaken, introduced a replay of the \"Dancing in the Dark\" sketch he and Radner had performed in a 1978 episode;[26] her ex-husband G. E. Smith performed a musical tribute to Radner with the SNL Band.\n |\n| Danitra Vance | 40 | August 21, 1994 | Vance died of breast cancer, which had returned after a remission three years earlier.\n |\n| Michael O'Donoghue | 54 | November 8, 1994 | O'Donoghue died from cerebral hemorrhage after suffering from severe chronic migraine headaches for most of his life. Bill Murray honored O'Donoghue's memory in an appearance on a season 20 episode[27] (hosted by Sarah Jessica Parker with musical guest R.E.M.) by replaying his sketch \"Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories: The Soiled Kimono\" from 1977.[28] |\n| Chris Farley | 33 | December 18, 1997 | Similar to Belushi, Farley died of a drug overdose from a speedball. His death occurred less than two months after he came back to host *SNL*, which turned out to be his final television appearance.\n |\n| Phil Hartman | 49 | May 28, 1998 | Hartman was murdered by his wife, Brynn, while he slept in his Encino, California, home. Before committing this crime, Brynn had allegedly consumed a combination of cocaine, alcohol, and the antidepressant drug Zoloft, and then committed suicide. During *SNL*'s 25th anniversary special in 1999, several of Hartman's peers honored his memory by replaying his sketch \"Love Is a Dream\" from 1988.\n |\n| Charles Rocket | 56 | October 7, 2005 | Rocket was found dead in his Canterbury, Connecticut, backyard. Local police concluded his death a suicide; Rocket had allegedly taken his own life by slashing his throat with a box cutter.\n |\n| Jan Hooks | 57 | October 9, 2014 | Hooks died after battling throat cancer for several months.

Thompson has been a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series *Saturday Night Live* since 2003, making him the longest-tenured cast member in the show's history.[2] He was also the first regular cast member born after the show's premiere in 1975. Outside of *SNL*, Thompson starred on NBC's sitcom *Kenan* from 2021 to 2022.\n\n\nThompson began his acting career in the early 1990s, and was an original cast member of Nickelodeon's sketch comedy series *All That* (1994\u20132005), where he often collaborated with co-star Kel Mitchell. Beginning in 1996, they starred in their own sitcom *Kenan & Kel* (1996\u20132000). Thompson also had roles in *The Mighty Ducks* franchise, *Good Burger*, and as the title character in the 2004 film *Fat Albert*.\n\n\nHe has been nominated six times for a Primetime Emmy Award for his work on *SNL*, winning once.[3] He is ranked at No. 88 on VH1's 100 Greatest Teen Stars.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThompson was born on May 10, 1978, in Columbus, Ohio.[4] His parents are Fletcher and Elizabeth Ann Thompson. He has two siblings: an older brother and a younger sister. His family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, when he was 9 months old.[4] Thompson's mother enrolled him in acting classes at age five. His first role as Toto in a church production of *The Wiz* had no lines.[2] He continued acting throughout his youth, appearing in school plays such as *The Gingerbread Duck*.[5] He auditioned for a theater company, The Youth Ensemble of Atlanta (YEA).[6] As a child, he was a fan of *The Price Is Right,* which he has called \"my first love\" and \"very joyful viewing\" that shaped his acting style.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nOne of Thompson's earliest roles was as an entertainment reporter for CNN's \"Real News for Kids\".[8] He went on to star in the original run of *All That* for its first five seasons, playing such characters as Principal Pimpell, Miss Piddlin, Pierre Escargot, and Superdude. He starred as Kenan Rockmore on Nickelodeon's *Kenan & Kel* from 1996 to 2000, mostly while still working on *All That*.[8] He began acting in his first movie, *D2: The Mighty Ducks, w*hile attending Tri-Cities High School, a visual and performing arts magnet school in East Point, Georgia.\n\n\n\n### Later career[edit]\n\n\nThompson has starred in several films including *Good Burger*, based on the *All That* sketch of the same title, and *Fat Albert*, in which he played the title character. He has also had supporting roles in the movies *Heavyweights*, *D2: The Mighty Ducks*, *D3: The Mighty Ducks*, *Love Don't Cost a Thing*, *Barbershop 2: Back in Business*, *My Boss's Daughter*, and *Snakes on a Plane*.\n\n\nIn 2009, Thompson was a regular voice actor in the Fox cartoon series *Sit Down, Shut Up*, portraying Sue Sezno who, like her last name, always says no.[9] The series premiered on April 19, 2009,[9] but was canceled after only four episodes due to low ratings and poor reviews. Thompson voiced the LeBron James puppet in Nike's MVP \"Most Valuable Puppets\" commercials, which were produced to be shown throughout the 2009 NBA playoffs. Thompson also guest-starred as Gus's estranged college singing buddy on the USA Network series *Psych* in the fourth-season episode \"High Top Fade Out\". In 2011, he returned to Nickelodeon, guest-starring in \"iParty with Victorious\", a crossover episode of sitcoms *iCarly* and *Victorious*.\n\n\nThompson appeared as a host of sorts of TeenNick's retro programming block, *The '90s Are All That*, appearing in many of the block's early bumpers and hyping material. He would return to the block, eventually called NickRewind but at the time called The Splat, for *All That*'s 22nd anniversary, with segments filmed at the 2015 New York Comic Con.[10]\n\n\n\n![Thompson waving](image)Thompson at a Washington Capitals event with the Stanley Cup in 2018\nIn 2015, movie ticketing website Fandango announced that Thompson would play their brand character, Miles Mouvay. Thompson would play Mouvay in 18 videos, eight 30-second commercials, and a few comedic skits.[11]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2015, Thompson appeared on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* alongside former *All That* co-star Kel Mitchell in which they reprised their popular *Good Burger* roles as \"Ed\" and \"Lester Oakes, Construction Worker\". They later competed against one another in an episode of the revived Nickelodeon game show *Double Dare* that aired in November 2018.[12]\n\n\nIn 2019, Thompson served as a judge for NBC's comedy competition series *Bring the Funny*.[13] He also became an executive producer with Mitchell for Nickelodeon's *All That* revival, premiering in June.[14] In May 2019, NBC announced they had picked up Thompson's single-camera comedy *The Kenan Show* to series. The series, retitled *Kenan*, premiered in 2021 on NBC, featuring Thompson as a newly-widowed father determined to be a \"super dad\".[15] He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series after its first season. In May 2022, the series was canceled after its second season.[16]\n\n\nIn 2020, he became the spokesman for Universal Destinations & Experiences\u2019 \"Let Yourself Woah\" campaign,[17] and was set to host the 2020 White House Correspondents' Dinner before it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[18]\n\n\n2021 would also see Thompson be named host of that year's Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards[19] and People's Choice Awards.[20] He also hosted *The Jonas Brothers Family Roast* on Netflix.[21]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Thompson co-founded the production company and talent incubator Artists for Artists (AFA). Their first announced project, *Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth Part 2* is in collaboration with Mike Tyson and wife Lakiha \"Kiki\" Spicer and a sequel to the boxer's 2013 HBO special. In March 2022, AFA fully funded the launch of Twenty Two Entertainment, led by actors Michael Rainey Jr. and Gianni Paolo, best known from the Starz series *Power Book II: Ghost*.[22][23]\n\n\nHe appears in the third episode of the revival of *The Kids in the Hall* as Ron, a Friend of the Kids in the Hall[24] and hosted the NHL Awards in June 2022.[25]\n\n\nHe hosted the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 12, 2022.[26]\n\n\n\n### *Saturday Night Live*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thompson in 2012\nThompson returned to sketch comedy when he joined the cast of *Saturday Night Live* in 2003, becoming the show's first cast member born after its 1975 premiere.[27] Thompson said he had sent several audition tapes to *SNL,* which dismissed him as looking too young; he said \"it was a couple years' worth of that\".[7] Thompson said that he feared his addition to the cast would be a \"disservice\" to the show: \"It was weird for me for a long time\".[7] Thompson was a featured player until 2005 (spanning the 29th and 30th seasons) and was promoted to repertory player at the beginning of season 31 (the 2005\u20132006 season).\n\n\nIn 2013, he refused to play any more black women on the show and demanded *SNL* hire black women instead.[28][29]\n\n\nThompson has been a cast member on *SNL* for 21 seasons,[30][31] breaking the record for the longest-tenured cast member in the show's history previously held by Darrell Hammond, who was on the show for 14 years. Thompson became the most senior cast member in the second half of the 2013\u201314 season, following the departure of Seth Meyers. He is also the longest-serving African-American cast member, surpassing Tim Meadows, who stayed on the show for ten seasons.[32] Thompson also holds the record for most celebrity impressions performed on the show, performing 139, beating Hammond's previous record of 107.[33] Although early on he planned to stay on the show until something else came along, by 2019 he noted that *SNL* was his \"forever plan\".[34][35]\n\n\nThompson has been nominated for five Primetime Emmys for his work on *SNL*, winning once. He has thrice been nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, in 2018, 2020 and 2021. For co-writing the song \"Last Christmas\", in 2017 he was nominated for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, an award he then won in 2018 for the lyrics to \"Come Back Barack\" (along with Chris Redd and Will Stephen).[36]\n\n\nIn 2014, *SNL* head writer Brian H. Tucker noted that simply putting \"KENAN REACTS\" would get a script more laughs, further elaborating, \"Put him in your sketch somewhere, anywhere, and your sketch will get better. Because Kenan knows how to take ordinary lines and make them funny, and take funny lines and make them special.\"[37] Similarly, Lorne Michaels in a 2019 article referred to Thompson as \"the person I most rely on in the cast\".[35] *Vulture* referred to him as the \"heir apparent\" to Phil Hartman, both being \"the glue\" of their respective casts.[38]\n\n\nThompson's celebrity impressions on *SNL* include Al Sharpton, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Cosby, Charles Barkley, David Ortiz, O. J. Simpson, and Steve Harvey.[39]\n\n\nHe has performed in over 1,500 sketches, hitting the mark during the March 5, 2022, episode hosted by Oscar Isaac.[40]\n\n\nIn commemoration of his 20th anniversary on the show, Thompson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 11, 2022. It was placed next to Lorne Michaels' star.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Recurring characters[edit]\n\n\n* Darnell Hayes, the host of *Black Jeopardy!*[39]\n* Diondre Cole, the host of *What Up with That?* (*What's Up with That?* in some episodes), who is repeatedly distracted by the show's theme song\n* Reese De'What, the host of *Cinema Classics*\n* Willie, Michael Che's overly optimistic neighbour\n* Jean K.

Hammond was a regular cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series *Saturday Night Live* from 1995 to 2009, and has been its announcer since 2014.\n\n\nUpon his departure from the cast in 2009, Hammond, at age 53, was the oldest cast member in the show's history. He has made more *SNL* appearances than any other cast member besides Kenan Thompson, and impersonated more than 107 celebrities, with Bill Clinton as his most frequent impression.[2] On September 19, 2014, Hammond was announced as the new announcer of *SNL,* replacing Don Pardo, who had died the month before.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHammond was born in Melbourne, Florida, the son of Margaret and Max Hammond.[1] He was severely abused by his mother, contributing to his lifelong struggles with depression and substance abuse.[4] Hammond's father, dealing with his own psychological issues resulting from his military service during World War II, often drank heavily and acted out violently. Hammond found as a child that doing impressions was the only thing he did his mother liked.[5]\n\n\nHe played baseball in high school and at Brevard Community College. In high school, he was a teammate of future San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy.[6] He went on to attend the University of Florida, where he graduated in 1978 with a degree in advertising and a 2.1 GPA.[6] He credits UF theater professor David Shelton for encouraging his work.[6] After completing college, Hammond moved to New York City where he worked as a waiter, studied at HB Studio, played roles in theater productions, and performed one set at a comedy club at age 26. Hammond then returned to Florida where he was a radio DJ at BJ 105 FM, telling Howard Stern in 2002, \"First I tried to be a jock, which I really sucked at,\" followed by being a voiceover artist in the Orlando area.[6][7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### *Saturday Night Live*[edit]\n\n\nAt 32 years old, Hammond moved back to New York to make one last attempt at being a stand-up comedian. After seven years and two failed *Saturday Night Live* auditions, he was spotted in 1995 by an SNL producer while doing a Bill Clinton impression - shortly after Phil Hartman, who had portrayed Clinton, left the show. After an exclusive audition for creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels, Hammond was brought on board as a cast member and performed for 14 seasons.[8] He previously held the record for the longest consecutive tenure of any *SNL* cast member in the show's history, until he was surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.[9]\n\n\nHe also holds *SNL* records for the second most impressions by a single cast member (107, as of the Zac Efron/Yeah Yeah Yeahs episode), beat only by Thompson, and also for the most times saying the show's catchphrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" to start the show (76 times, beating out Dana Carvey).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe is best known on the show for not only his impersonations of Bill Clinton, but also Al Gore, Donald Trump, John McCain, Regis Philbin, Dick Cheney, Chris Matthews, Phil Donahue, Phil McGraw, Ted Koppel, John Travolta, Jesse Jackson, Geraldo Rivera, Dan Rather, and Sean Connery, in the recurring \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" skits. His impression of Clinton is currently the most frequent *SNL* impression of all time, appearing in 87 sketches over 14 years in the cast and numerous cameos. Hammond also impersonated *SNL* announcer Don Pardo, filling in for Pardo on occasions when the announcer was unavailable.[10]\n\n\nAfter the end of the 34th season, Hammond retired from the show after a record-breaking 14 years as a repertory player. Hammond was the last *SNL* cast member from the 1990s to leave the show. After leaving the show, he has made multiple cameo appearances.\n\n\nIn 2014 Hammond took over the announcer role on *SNL* starting with the 40th-season premiere, replacing Pardo, who had died that August.[3] Since he began as announcer, he has also appeared in skits numerous times reprising his Clinton and Trump impersonations.[11]\n\n\nThe following season Hammond reappeared on the show, doing his impression of Trump just as the real Trump began performing well in the Republican primaries. Hammond moved back to New York in 2016 after Trump won the nomination, expecting to be appearing on a weekly basis during the election. However, *SNL* producer Lorne Michaels decided instead to go with Alec Baldwin's impression, believing that it more effectively captured the contemporary Trump.[5]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Hammond gained fame for his impersonations of Elmer Fudd and other Looney Tunes characters in the comedy single \"Wappin'.\" The song was popular enough with *Dr. Demento* listeners to be included on the show's 20th-anniversary compilation.\n\n\nHammond is a frequent guest on *The Howard Stern Show.* He has also guest-starred in episodes of *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit* and *Law & Order: Criminal Intent;*. He had his own stand-up comedy special on Comedy Central: *Comedy Central Presents Darrell Hammond.* Hammond can frequently be seen at The Comedy Cellar in New York City.\n\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Hammond made his Broadway theatre debut, playing the role of Vice Principal Douglas Panch in *The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.* In 2009, Hammond had a guest starring role on the FX drama *Damages.* The same summer, Hammond appeared with Eli Manning, Peyton Manning, and Donald Trump in an Oreo commercial, where he does an impression of Trump.[12]\n\n\nBeginning in May 2015, Hammond began playing the role of fast-food mascot Colonel Sanders in an ad campaign for KFC, until Norm Macdonald replaced him on August 17, 2015.[13]\n\n\nSince returning to Los Angeles in 2017, Hammond has appeared in episodes of *Criminal Minds,* *At Home with Amy Sedaris*, and a *Friday Night Lights* spoof series on sports website *The Kicker*.[5]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHammond married his wife, Elizabeth, on May 9, 1990.[14] The couple divorced in the early 1990s, then remarried in 1997. They have a daughter together, Mia (born 1998). Hammond was seen with another woman several times in May and June 2011, prompting speculation about their marriage.[*citation needed*] During a 2012 appearance on the *Imus in the Morning* radio program, Hammond revealed that the couple was in the process of divorcing,[15] and later that same year the divorce became final.\n\n\nHammond has admitted to struggling with alcoholism and cocaine addiction.[16] The death of a close friend in 1991 led to a relapse of drug and alcohol abuse.[17] Hammond regularly wears all black when not performing as an homage to another friend who committed suicide in 1992.[5] After another relapse in 2009, Hammond went to rehab.[16]\n\n\nIn August 2011, Hammond filed a lawsuit against Jose Mendez and Dona Monteleone after a car accident in which he was the passenger. Monteleone, who was driving Hammond's vehicle at the time of the accident, is a Manhattan real estate agent.[18]\n\n\nDuring an October 2011 interview with CNN, Hammond revealed that his mother had abused him during his childhood. His anxiety from abuse led to cutting, several hospitalizations due to psychiatric issues, and diagnoses which initially included bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder.[19]\n\n\nHammond says that he was medicated throughout his tenure on *Saturday Night Live,* and that he cut himself backstage and was once taken from the studio to a psychiatric ward.[20] The incident helped him come to terms with what he and the doctor who treated him realized was his fundamental issue, the posttraumatic stress disorder stemmed from his abusive childhood.[5] Just prior to his 2000 appearance as Al Gore in a sketch parodying that year's first presidential debate, he had a panic attack due to forgetting his lines. However, he gave a performance so effective that Gore's campaign staff made him watch it to understand why he had aroused negative reactions in some viewers.[5]\n\n\nHarperCollins published Hammond's memoir, *God, If You're Not Up There, I'm F\\*cked*, in 2011. It is an account of his abusive childhood, psychiatric issues, struggles with substance abuse, and experiences on *Saturday Night Live.*[16] In 2015 he adapted it into a one-man play starring himself, directed by Christopher Ashley, which debuted in San Diego, California, at La Jolla Playhouse to positive reviews. The director has expressed plans for a Broadway residency, although Hammond stated he would prefer an actor to play him instead, as he found the tour so stressful he had to be hospitalized twice during the Los Angeles run.[5]\n\n\nIn 2015 Hammond revived his Trump impression on *SNL*, after Taran Killam's attempt failed to gain public interest. The following year he returned to New York after five years, expecting that with Trump having received the Republican presidential nomination that year, he would be appearing on the show more in the fall. When Alec Baldwin replaced him, he fell into a deep depression and was prescribed Antabuse and a beta blocker to prevent a relapse of his addiction issues. Hammond and his girlfriend eventually moved back to Los Angeles, where reminders of Baldwin's Trump impression were less advertised.[5]\n\n\n\n### Entrapment incident[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Hammond said that he worked briefly as a stand-up comedian on Premier Cruise Line ships.[21][22] One evening, while the ship was docked in the Bahamas, Hammond says he visited a restaurant, where he consumed the equivalent of 16 shots of rum.[23] He claimed that a man repeatedly asked him throughout the evening to take a dollar bill with trace amounts of cocaine on it.[21] When he left the bar to use the restroom, the man followed him into the stall and told him, \"I think you should take this with you.\"[21] Believing he was about to be mugged, he relented, and the man placed the bill inside Hammond's pocket.[21] Local police were waiting outside the restroom and quickly arrested him. According to Hammond, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration later told him that the episode had been a setup, and that local authorities regularly entrap American tourists;[21] he spent a weekend in jail. Hammond was released after his father traveled to the Bahamas and paid $3,000 for his son's release.[21]\n\n\nHammond first publicly mentioned his incarceration in the Bahamas as a guest on a 1998 episode of the radio show *Loveline*;[21] and again when he returned to *Loveline* in 2000 and 2004, as well as during an appearance on the *Opie & Anthony* show in 2012.[22][23][24]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n | *Celtic Pride* | Chris McCarthy\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Blues Brothers 2000* | Robertson\n |  |\n| 1999\n | *The King and I* | Master Little\n | Voice\n |\n| 2003\n | *Agent Cody Banks* | Earl\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Scary Movie 3* | Father Muldoon\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *New York Minute* | Hudson McGill\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Kiss Me Again* | Michael\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Puff, Puff, Pass* | Jonathan\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Ira & Abby* | Dr. Lawrence Rosenblum\n |  |\n| 2007\n | *Epic Movie* | Captain Jack Swallows |  |\n| 2007\n | *Netherbeast Incorporated* | Turner Claymore\n |  |\n| 2007\n | *Shortcut to Happiness* | Andrew Bailey\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Wieners* | Dr. Dwayne\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *BuzzKill* | Karaoke Killer\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Nature Calls* | Ranger Deakins\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Scary Movie 5* | Dr. Hall\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Cora Bora* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\u20132009, 2014\u2013present\n | *Saturday Night Live* | Various (1995\u20132009); announcer (2014\u2013present)\n | 308 episodes\n |\n| 1997\n | *A Freezerburnt Christmas* | Voice\n | Television film\n |\n| 2000\n | *3rd Rock from the Sun* | Darrell Hammond\n | Episode: \"Dick'll Take Manhattan: Part 2\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit* | Ted Bolger\n | Episode: \"Runaway\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Primetime Glick* | Dick Cheney | Episode: \"Kathie Lee Gifford/Dick Cheney\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Law & Order: Criminal Intent* | Leonard Timmons\n | Episode: \"No Exit\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Starved* | Josh\n | Episode: \"3D\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Las Vegas* | Ben Carlson / Carlos / Ted Waters\n | Episode: \"Double Down, Triple Threat\"\n |\n| 2009\n | *Damages* | The Deacon\n | 7 episodes\n |\n| 2012\n | *Are We There Yet?* | Brick Street\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| 2014\n | *Deadbeat* | Don Soderbergh\n | Episode: \"The Knockoff\"\n |\n| 2016\n | *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt* | Announcer\n | Episode: \"Kimmy Goes Roller Skating!\"\n |\n| 2016\n | *Brad Neely's Harg Nallin' Sclopio Peepio* | Various\n | 10 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Criminal Minds* | Lawrence Coleman\n | Episode: \"The Bunker\"\n |\n| 2017\u20132020\n | *At Home with Amy Sedaris* | Various\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| 2018\n | *The Last Sharknado: It's About Time* | George Washington | Television film\n |\n| 2018\n | *Dream Corp LLC* | Bill Ruff\n | Episode: \"Wild Bill\"\n |\n| 2019\n | *Bizaardvark* | Red Duckworth\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2021\n | *What If...?* | Nazi General (voice)\n | Episode: \"What If...

He currently hosts *Late Night with Seth Meyers*, a late-night talk show on NBC. Prior to *Late Night*, Meyers was a cast member on NBC's sketch comedy series *Saturday Night Live* from 2001 to 2014, and served as the show's head writer and anchor of their news parody segment, *Weekend Update*, from 2006 until his departure.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMeyers was born in Evanston, Illinois,[2] and was raised in Okemos, Michigan, from four to ten years of age, and Bedford, New Hampshire, after that. Meyers's mother, Hilary Claire (n\u00e9e Olson), was a French teacher, and his father, Laurence Meyers Jr., worked in finance.[3] His younger brother, Josh Meyers, is an actor and comedian.\n\n\nHis paternal grandfather was an Ashkenazi Jewish emigrant from Kalvarija near Marijampol\u0117 in modern-day Lithuania.[4][5][6][7] The rest of his ancestry is Czech, Austrian, Croatian (from his paternal grandmother), Swedish (from his maternal grandfather), English, and German.[8] Meyers discovered on the show *Finding Your Roots* that his family's original surname, Trakianski, was changed by his great-grandfather to Meyers, after his own father Mejer Trakianski.[6]\n\n\nMeyers attended Edgewood Elementary in Okemos.[9] He graduated from Manchester High School West in New Hampshire. He graduated in 1996 from Northwestern University in Evanston (the town of his birth), where he became a member of the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta. His college roommate was fellow actor Peter Grosz.[10] He majored in film and television production. In 2011, he was the Grand Marshal for the school's homecoming parade.[11] In 2016, he delivered the commencement address at Northwestern's graduation.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nWhile attending college at Northwestern University, Meyers began performing improv comedy as a member of the Northwestern University improv sketch group Mee-Ow Show. He continued his career at ImprovOlympic with the group Preponderate as well as overseas as a cast member of Boom Chicago, an English language improv troupe based in Amsterdam,[13] where his brother was also a cast member.[14] When a Boom Chicago show he developed was mounted in Chicago, he was noticed by *Saturday Night Live* talent scouts and invited to audition.\n\n\n\n### *Saturday Night Live*[edit]\n\n\nMeyers joined the *Saturday Night Live* cast in 2001.[14] In 2005, he was promoted to writing supervisor, and in January 2006, he became co-head writer, sharing the role with Tina Fey and Andrew Steele.[15] In 2004, he auditioned to co-anchor *Weekend Update* with Fey, but lost to Amy Poehler.[16] With Fey's departure, Meyers became head writer for the 2006\u20132007 season and also assumed the role of *Weekend Update* co-anchor with Amy Poehler, though around this time, his cast contract was up. The show wanted him to sign a contract in which he would solely be the head writer, if he didn't get Weekend Update. Meyers refused to sign the contract, and waited to see what the plans for Update were. He considered leaving SNL altogether if he wasn't added to Update.[17][18][19] In fall 2009, Meyers co-anchored two episodes of *Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday* with Poehler.[20] After Poehler's departure, Meyers anchored solo between 2008 and 2013. In the 2013\u20132014 season, Cecily Strong joined Meyers as co-anchor until his departure mid-season.\n\n\nOn *SNL*, Meyers impersonated such figures as John Kerry, Michael Caine, Anderson Cooper, Carrot Top, Prince Charles, Ryan Seacrest, Sean Penn, Stone Phillips, Tobey Maguire, Peyton Manning, Ben Curtis (also known as the Dell Dude), Ty Pennington, Bill Cowher, Brian Williams, Nicollette Sheridan, Wade Robson, Donald Trump Jr., Tom Cruise, and Kevin Federline.[14] His recurring characters included Zach Ricky, host of the kids' hidden camera show \"Pranksters\"; Nerod, the receptionist in the recurring sketch \"Appalachian Emergency Room\"; David Zinger, a scientist who often insults his fellow workers; DJ Johnathan Feinstein, the DJ on the webcam show \"Jarett's Room\"; Dan Needler, half of a married couple \"that should be divorced,\" (opposite Amy Poehler); William Fitzpatrick, from the Irish talk show \"Top o' the Morning,\" and Boston Powers (one of the comedians in the \"Original Kings of Catchphrase Comedy\" series). In the season 29 episode hosted by Lindsay Lohan, he portrayed Ron Weasley in a parody of *Harry Potter*.\n\n\nMeyers received critical praise for his part in several iconic *SNL* sketches during his tenure. During the 2008 United States presidential election, Meyers wrote the sketches for former *SNL* cast member Tina Fey, who returned as a guest star to impersonate Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Meyers created the famed phrase uttered by Fey's Palin, \"I can see Russia from my house.\"[21][22][23]\n\n\nDuring their time as hosts on *Weekend Update*, Meyers and Poehler had a popular recurring bit, \"Really!?! with Seth and Amy.\" Both hosts would take turns mocking people in the news, ending each point with a heavily sarcastic \"Really!?!\", which *Rolling Stone* writer Jon Blistein characterized as a \"torrent of exasperation and bewilderment.\" Following Poehler's departure from the show in 2008, they revived the \"Really!?!\" segment several times when she returned as a guest.[24][25] After Meyers left the show for his own talk show, Poehler made a surprise appearance on *Late Night with Seth Meyers* in June 2015 to join Meyers in mocking *Sports Illustrated* sportswriter Andy Benoit, after he disparaged women's sports as \"not worth watching.\"[22][26][27]\n\n\nAdditionally, the \"Abe Lincoln\" sketch Meyers wrote for Louis C.K., done in the style of his sitcom, *Louie*, and the *Girls* parody, starring Tina Fey as the new Albanian \"girl\", were praised by critics as among the best sketches Meyers contributed to *SNL*.[22][23]\n\n\nMeyers supported and picketed during the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike. When interviewed, he said, \"We all know how lucky we are to have the jobs we have. We're not asking for much. You have to change the rules because people are watching TV in a different way.\"[28] Even so, he mentioned in interviews that he regretted missing much of the presidential election primary season.[29][30]\n\n\nMeyers performed in his final episode of *SNL* February 1, 2014.[22] Strong, Poehler, Bill Hader (in character as Stefon), Andy Samberg, and Fred Armisen (as former New York state governor David Paterson) joined him at the Weekend Update desk. Meyers returned to host the show in 2018, with Paul Simon as the musical guest.[31]\n\n\n\n### *Late Night*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Late Night with Seth Meyers\n\nNBC announced on May 12, 2013, that Meyers would be the new host of *Late Night* in 2014, succeeding Jimmy Fallon, as Fallon became host of *The Tonight Show*. Meyers assumed his role on *Late Night* on February 24, 2014, and his first guest was former *SNL* castmate and Weekend Update anchor Amy Poehler.[32] Meyers announced February 10, 2014, that the bandleader for his house band \"The 8G Band\" would be his former SNL colleague Fred Armisen.[33] More recently, he and his Sethmaker Shoemeyers Productions company signed an overall deal with NBCUniversal.[34]\n\n\n\n## Other pursuits[edit]\n\n\nMeyers won the third season of Bravo's *Celebrity Poker Showdown* in 2004, and donated the $100,000 prize to the Boston-based Jimmy Fund.[35][36] Meyers and *SNL* castmate Bill Hader penned a *Spider-Man* one-off entitled *The Short Halloween*. It was illustrated by Kevin Maguire and was published May 29, 2009. Benjamin Birdie of Comic Book Resources gave the work three and a half stars on a scale of five.[37] Meyers, along with Mike Shoemaker of *SNL*, created an animated half-hour series titled *The Awesomes*, produced by Lorne Michaels' company, Broadway Video, that aired on Hulu beginning August 2013.[38] He and his brother Josh Meyers host a podcast called *Family Trips with the Meyers Brothers*; the first episode was released on June 27, 2023.[39][40] On August 30, 2023, Meyers began hosting the comedy podcast *Strike Force Five* with Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver to support their staff members out of work due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n### Awards hosting[edit]\n\n\nMeyers has hosted the Webby Awards twice, in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, Meyers hosted the Microsoft Company Meeting at Safeco Field in Seattle.[44] Meyers hosted the 2010 and 2011 ESPY Awards on ESPN.[45] In April 2011, Meyers was the keynote speaker at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. During his introductory remarks, he made a joke about Osama bin Laden's actions while in hiding; namely, that bin Laden was hosting his own afternoon television show on C-SPAN.[46] Meyers was unaware that US intelligence had located bin Laden and the Navy SEALs planned an attack on his location for the next day. In the same speech, he mocked Donald Trump (who was in attendance) for his attempts in finding then US President Barack Obama's birth certificate. He also mocked Trump's intention of running for president, which many later jokingly said was the reason for Trump's later candidacy in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2014, Meyers hosted the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards.[47] In 2018, Meyers hosted the 75th Golden Globe Awards.[48][49]\n\n\n\n## Influences[edit]\n\n\nMeyers has said that his comedy influences are David Letterman,[50] Monty Python,[51] Steve Martin,[52] Dennis Miller,[53] Mel Brooks,[54] Woody Allen,[55] Richard Pryor,[55] P. G. Wodehouse,[55] Conan O'Brien,[55] and Jon Stewart.[56]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMeyers became engaged to his girlfriend of five years, attorney Alexi Ashe, in July 2013.[57][58] The two married in a Jewish ceremony September 1, 2013, on Martha's Vineyard.[59][60] Their first son, Ashe Olson Meyers (named after his wife and his mother's maiden names, respectively[61]), was born at Lenox Hill Hospital on March 27, 2016.[62] On April 8, 2018, the couple's second son, Axel Strahl Meyers, was delivered in the lobby of their apartment building.[63] On November 24, 2021, he announced the birth of his daughter, Adelaide Ruth Meyers, during *Late Night*'s *Corrections* segment.[64]\n\n\nWhile interviewing Jake Tapper on the December 4, 2018, episode of *Late Night*, Meyers said that while he is not Jewish, his wife is; consequently, their children are being raised Jewish.[65] Their son Axel's middle name Strahl is after the surname of his wife's Holocaust survivor grandparents.[66][67][68]\nBeginning in July 2013, Alexi Ashe worked as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, assigned to the Sex Crimes Bureau.[69] She has since joined Sanctuary for Families as an advocate for victims of gender violence.[70][71]\n\n\nMeyers's children, dressed as \"murder hornets\", made a quick appearance during one COVID-19 episode of *A Closer Look*, filmed in the family's attic.[72]\n\n\nMeyers is a fan of the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Celtics, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Pittsburgh Penguins (his father being a Pittsburgh native), the Northwestern Wildcats (his alma mater), and two soccer teams, namely the Netherlands national football team and the Premier League club West Ham United.[73][74]\n\n\nA fan of comics, he has cited Joe Hill's supernatural comic book series *Locke & Key* as one of his favorite comic book series. IDW Publishing gave him some of the replica keys they had licensed.[75]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | *See This Movie* | Jake Barrymore |  |\n| *Maestro* | Tim Healy | Short film\n |\n| *Thunder Road* | Voice-over | Short film\n |\n| 2005 | *Perception* | Steven |  |\n| *The Adventures of Big Handsome Guy and his Little Friend* | Disgruntled Dork | Short film\n |\n| 2006 | *American Dreamz* | Chet Krogl |  |\n| 2007 | *Hot Rod* | none | Co-producer\n |\n| 2008 | *Journey to the Center of the Earth* | Professor Alan Kitzens |  |\n| *Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist* | Drunk Guy in Yugo |  |\n| 2009 | *Spring Breakdown* | William Rushfield |  |\n| 2010 | *MacGruber* | none | Executive producer\n |\n| 2011 | *I Don't Know How She Does It* | Chris Bunce |  |\n| *New Year's Eve* | Griffin Byrne |  |\n| 2014 | *The Interview* | Himself | Cameo\n |\n| 2019 | *Late Night* | Himself | Cameo\n |\n| 2022 | *Bros* | Harvey Milk |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001 | *Spin City* | Doug | Episode \"Rain on My Charades\"\n |\n| 2001\u201314 | *Saturday Night Live* | Himself / Various | 253 episodes; also head writer\n |\n| 2008\u201312 | *Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday* | Himself | 8 episodes; also head writer\n |\n| 2010 | *2010 ESPY Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| 2011 | *White House Correspondents' Dinner* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| *2011 ESPY Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| 2012\u201316 | *The Mindy Project* | Matt / Himself | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2013 | *70th Golden Globe Awards* | none | TV specialWriter\n |\n| *The Office* | Himself | Episode: \"Finale\"\n |\n| 2013\u201315 | *The Awesomes* | Prock (voice) | Also creator, writer, executive producer\n |\n| 2014 | *71st Golden Globe Awards* | none | TV specialWriter\n |\n| 2014\u2013present | *Late Night with Seth Meyers* | Himself (host) | Also writer\n |\n| 2014 | *66th Primetime Emmy Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| 2015 | *72nd Golden Globe Awards* | none | TV specialWriter\n |\n| *4th Annual NFL Honors* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| *Portlandia* | Chad Koop | Episode: \"Dead Pets\"\n |\n| 2015\u2013present | *Documentary Now!* | none | Co-creator, writer, executive producer\n |\n| 2015 | *Difficult People* | Dog Park Guy | Episode: \"Premium Membership\"\n |\n| 2016 | *Lady Dynamite* | Himself | Episode: \"Mein Ramp\"\n |\n| *This Is Us* | Himself | Episode: \"The Best Washing Machine in the Whole World\"\n |\n| 2018 | *75th Golden Globe Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| 2018\u201321 | *A.P.

With his comedy partner Carrie Brownstein, Armisen was the co-creator and co-star of the IFC sketch comedy series *Portlandia*. He also co-created and stars in the mockumentary IFC series *Documentary Now!* alongside Bill Hader and Seth Meyers as well as the Showtime comedy series *Moonbase 8,* alongside John C. Reilly and Tim Heidecker. He also voiced Speedy Gonzales on *The Looney Tunes Show*. \n\n\nArmisen is the bandleader and frequent drummer for the *Late Night with Seth Meyers* house band, The 8G Band. He is also well-known for being a cast member on the late-night sketch comedy and variety series *Saturday Night Live* from 2002 to 2013.\n\n\nArmisen has acted in comedy films, including *Melvin Goes to Dinner* (2003), *The Ex* (2006), and *The Dictator* (2012). He is also notable for his guest-starring appearances in television shows such as *30 Rock*, *Parks and Recreation*, *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*, *New Girl*, *Broad City*, *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt*, *Difficult People*, *The Last Man on Earth*, *Toast of London*, *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, *Modern Family*, and *Barry.*\n\n\nHe received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Comedy Album for *Standup for Drummers* in 2019. He has also won two Peabody Awards, one in 2008 as part of the *Saturday Night Live* political satire cast[1] and one in 2011 for *Portlandia*.[2] From 2019 to 2022, he co-starred and served as writer and executive producer on the Spanish-language series *Los Espookys*, which he co-created.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family history[edit]\n\n\nFereydun Robert Armisen was born on December 4, 1966, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.[3] He moved with his family to New York as a baby[4] and briefly lived in Brazil in his youth. He was raised on Long Island in Valley Stream, New York,[4] where he was a high school classmate of fellow *SNL* alumnus Jim Breuer.[5] Armisen attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan[6] before dropping out to begin a career as a rock drummer.[4] He has mentioned excitement at seeing the bands The Clash and Devo perform on television and wanting to be a performer since he was a child.[7]\n\n\nHis mother, school teacher Hildegardt Mirabal Level, was born in San Fernando de Apure, Venezuela,[8][9] and he has family from both San Rafael de Atamaica and from Apure.[10] His father, Fereydun Herbert \"Fred\" Armisen, who worked for IBM, was born in Soltau, Lower Saxony, Germany, to a German mother and a Korean-born father.[10][11]\n\n\nFor much of his life, Armisen thought his paternal grandfather was Japanese. However, his grandfather\u2014Ehara Masami, better known by his professional pseudonym Masami Kuni or birth name Park Yeong-in[10][12]\u2014was actually born in Ulsan, Korea, and had adopted a Japanese name and persona after the massacre of Koreans in 1923 when he was a high school student.[13][10] Park studied aesthetics at Tokyo Imperial University and became a professional dancer before moving to Germany.[14][12] After the war, he returned to Japan, and formed a premier modern dance company. He eventually emigrated to the US, where he taught dance at what is now Cal State Fullerton from 1964 to 1975.[12][11] Park Yeong-in's family were members of the Korean aristocracy, and Armisen's Korean lineage can be verifiably traced back to the 1600s.[11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, Armisen played drums in a local band along with his high school friends in Valley Stream, New York, but the group soon ended. In 1988, he moved to Chicago to play drums for the punk rock band Trenchmouth,[15] and in the 1990s he played background drums with Blue Man Group.\n\n\nArmisen played drums on three tracks for Les Savy Fav's 2007 album *Let's Stay Friends*,[16] as well as tracks for Matthew Sweet's 2011 album *Modern Art*[17] and Wandering Lucy's 1996[18] album *Leap Year*.[17]\n\n\nArmisen is the music director and frequent drummer[19] of the 8G Band, the house band for *Late Night with Seth Meyers*, since February 24, 2014.[20]\n\n\nIn 2018, Armisen played drums as part of Devo at John Waters' Burger Boogaloo festival in Oakland, California.[21][22]\n\n\nIn July 2021, he performed at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island.[23]\n\n\n\n### Television and film[edit]\n\n\nWhile not playing with the band Trenchmouth, Armisen's interests switched to acting. In a January 2006 interview, he said, \"I wanted to be on TV somehow. For some reason, I always thought it would be an indirect route; I didn't know that it would be comedy and *Saturday Night Live*. I just wanted to do something with performing that would lead me there.\"[24]\n\n\nArmisen's subsequent television work, such as some \"memorable Andy Kaufman\u2013esque appearances\"[25] on *Late Night with Conan O'Brien*, as well as work for *Crank Yankers* and *Adult Swim*, led to a role in 2002 as a featured player in the cast of *Saturday Night Live*.[25] In the 2004 season, he was promoted to repertory cast member.\n\n\nArmisen has landed several minor yet memorable roles that were defined by an interviewer as \"feral foreigners\"[26] in comedy films such as *Eurotrip*, *Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo*, *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy*, *Deck the Halls*, *The Ex*, *The Promotion*, *The Rocker*, *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny*, and *Confessions of a Shopaholic*.\n\n\nFurther television work included an appearance on *Parks and Recreation* in the 2009 episode \"Sister City\".[27] For the Cartoon Network series *The Looney Tunes Show* (2011\u20132014), Armisen voices Speedy Gonzales. He and fellow *Saturday Night Live* alums Bill Hader and Seth Meyers write, produce, and star in the IFC mockumentary series *Documentary Now!*[28] which premiered in 2015.\n\n\nArmisen starred in the IFC sketch series *Portlandia* alongside Carrie Brownstein (of Sleater-Kinney); the first season debuted on January 21, 2011.[29] With Brownstein, he appeared on the 2012 *Simpsons* episode \"The Day the Earth Stood Cool\", in which they play the Simpsons' new neighbors, who encourage everyone to be cool like them.[30][31]\n\n\nSince 2014, Armisen has been music director and sometimes bandleader and drummer on *Late Night with Seth Meyers*, for which he received positive reviews for his deadpan comedy and especially for his interplay with the host.[32]\n\n\nFor his work on *Portlandia*, Armisen was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in 2012, 2013, and 2014[33] and for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2014.\n\n\nIn 2021, Armisen was executive producer on the documentary *Charm Circle*, directed by Nira Burstein.[34]\n\n\n\n### *Saturday Night Live*[edit]\n\n\nArmisen joined the cast of *Saturday Night Live* in 2002.[35] He was promoted to a repertory player in 2004. After 11 years as a cast member, he decided to leave the show. At the time of his 2013 departure from the show,[36][37] Armisen was the third-longest-tenured cast member (behind Seth Meyers and Darrell Hammond), and he appeared in the second-highest number of sketches (856) of any cast member. Since then, Armisen has come back for multiple cameo appearances on the show, including when he hosted the season 41 finale on May 21, 2016, with musical guest Courtney Barnett.\n\n\nThe following is a partial list of notable roles Armisen has played in *Saturday Night Live* sketches.\n\n\n\n#### Recurring characters[edit]\n\n\n* Billy Smith \u2013 a Native American stand-up comedian who tells Native-American-themed jokes that no one understands.\n* Fericito \u2013 a Venezuelan nightclub comedian who has his own TV show, *Show Biz Grande Explosion* with sidekick Manuel (Horatio Sanz).\n* Gunther Kelly \u2013 a student at George Washington University who performs songs on *Weekend Update* with his brother Patrick (played by Will Forte).\n* Leonard \u2013 the strange European host of the foreign music show *Club Traxx*.\n* Mackey \u2013 a senile drummer who often does rimshots at inappropriate moments and appears in the \"Rialto Grande\" sketches.\n* Nooni Schoener \u2013 a quirky, foreign art dealer who appears with his wife Nuni Schoener (played by Maya Rudolph) in \"the Schoeners\" sketches.\n* Frondi \u2013 a mentally challenged character who criticizes Ben Affleck's movie *Gigli* to Ben himself.\n* Manuel Ortiz \u2013 host of *The Manuel Ortiz* show on Television Dominicana where he \"helps with whatever it is\" his audience members are going through.\n* Nicholas Fehn \u2013 a political commentator whose mind wanders so much that he is incapable of finishing a sentence without starting a new one.\n* Roger A. Trevanti \u2013 a greedy studio head and AMPTP member who rails against the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike. The character's only *SNL* appearance was on the last episode of season 33, before the show went on hiatus for the WGA strike, but he appeared in several Internet videos around the same time.\n* Rodger Brush \u2013 a producer of multiple \"Dr. Phil\"-type talk shows, each focused on a different topic (teen, marital, sexual, and pregnancy issues), who fills in when the hosts are sick. He repeatedly tells guests relating their problems to speak up, and, unable to relate to their problems, offers them either useless advice based on his experience or no help at all.\n* Garth \u2013 part of Garth & Kat (with Kristen Wiig), a musical duo who appear on *Weekend Update* unprepared and make up songs on the spot.\n* Giuseppe \u2013 the saxophone player for *What's Up With That?*\n* Stuart \u2013 homeowner from *The Californians*, a soap opera parody featuring Armisen, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig and others as wealthy blondes with Valley girl accents.\n* One of the \"Dictator's Two Best Friends from Growing Up\" (with Vanessa Bayer) who come to *Weekend Update* to secretly trash-talk the various dictators (such as Muammar al-Gaddafi and Kim Jong-un) with whom they grew up.\n* Regine \u2013 a pretentious and condescending woman who exhibits blatant euphoric and erotic facial expressions when touched on certain parts of her body.\n* Ian Rubbish \u2013 A late-1970s/early-80s British punk rocker, a parody of Sex Pistols' John Lydon, who caught heat from his bandmates Derek Gash (played by Bill Hader) and Keith Grimshaw (played by Taran Killam) and fans for writing and performing songs supporting Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\n#### Celebrity impressions[edit]\n\n\nArmisen's list of notable impressions has included:\n\n\n\n* Barack Obama \u2013 recurring in Season 33 and Season 34 episodes as the Democratic presidential candidate (Season 33), the Democratic nominee, President-elect, and President (Season 34), beginning on February 23, 2008. As of season 38, Jay Pharoah replaced Armisen as Obama.\n* Prince \u2013 parody of the musician as the host of a talk show called *The Prince Show*, with Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles (played by Maya Rudolph) as his co-host.

Armisen has stated that Steve Jobs is the celebrity he most enjoys portraying.[38]\n* Ira Glass \u2013 After seeing an unused *SNL* sketch, Glass invited Armisen to co-host a *This American Life* episode about doppelg\u00e4ngers.[39]\n* David Paterson \u2013 Governor of New York.\n* Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 There were four sketches between the years 2010 and 2012 where he played the Queen of the United Kingdom.\n* Michael Bloomberg \u2013 numerous sketches between 2011 and present, including recurrent segments during the 2020 Democratic Primaries.\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, he posed as a music journalist for the short film *Fred Armisen's Guide to Music and South by Southwest*. It was filmed by then-girlfriend Sally Timms and featured Armisen's \"pranking musicians and industry types\" during the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.[40] In various segments he asked self-described \"stupid\" questions, pretended to be German, and also acted blind.[41] A year later, Armisen starred with alternative rock legend Steve Albini in Chevelle's *Point No. 1 EPK*.\n\n\nArmisen is part of ThunderAnt, a comedy duo with Sleater-Kinney guitarist Carrie Brownstein. The duo specializes in creating comedic short skits often about independent vocations such as one-man shows, feminist bookstores, and bicycle rights activists. Armisen founded ThunderAnt.com, a website that features the comedy sketches created with Brownstein. \n\n\nArmisen has directed music videos for bands like The Helio Sequence. Armisen also had a role in the Wilco documentary *I Am Trying to Break Your Heart*, which featured footage from his stint opening for front man Jeff Tweedy's 2001 solo tour. He also appeared in video segments on Blue Man Group's How to be a Megastar Tour 2.0. Armisen occasionally writes for Pitchfork Media and interviewed Cat Power for that company.[42] He appeared as Jens Hannemann on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* on October 19, 2007, promoting a 28-minute DVD called *Fred Armisen presents Jens Hannemann: \"COMPLICATED DRUMMING TECHNIQUE\"*.[43] In 2010, Armisen briefly joined Joanna Newsom's tour for her album *Have One on Me* as his character Jens Hannemann.[44] On *SNL*, Armisen often plays musical instruments in sketches, has two recurring characters who are musicians (Mackey the drummer from the Rialto Grande and Ferecito from *Showbiz Grande Explosion*), or impersonates famous figures in the music world such as Liberace, Phil Spector, Lou Reed, and Prince.\n\n\nArmisen appeared in the official music video for Man Man's song \"Rabbit Habits\", playing a man who charms his blind date (Charlyne Yi) but runs away after she turns into a werewolf.[45]\n\n\nIn 2013, Armisen appeared in the official music video for Portland, Oregon-based band Red Fang's song \"Blood Like Cream\". In 2021, he appeared as the protagonist in the official music video for the 2020 mix of George Harrison's song \"My Sweet Lord\".[46][47]\n\n\nAlong with Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis, Armisen voiced radio characters in the video game *Grand Theft Auto IV*. Armisen would also continue to appear in other titles from Rockstar Games, such as a pharmacist in Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto V as a judge on an in-game reality TV show, strongly parodying Simon Cowell, and Red Dead Redemption 2 as a host at an in-game theatre you can attend. \n\n\nArmisen performed as a singer/drummer/comedic actor in the Blue Man Group's \"How to be a Megastar Live!\". He played the part of a salesman on TV who advertises for the Megastar Rock Manual. He also drummed in the performance and was a backup singer.\n\n\nIn late 2014, Armisen was featured on the popular comedy web series *Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee* with host Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n\nArmisen is a longtime fan of punk rock music and can be seen in the documentaries *Salad Days* and *The Damned: Don't You Wish That We Were Dead*.\n\n\nIn 2015, Armisen was the recipient of *Smithsonian* magazine's American Ingenuity Award for Performing Arts.[48]\n\n\nIn 2018, Armisen provided the foreword to *The Yacht Rock Book* by author Greg Prato.[49]\n\n\nHe appears as Michael on the sixth episode of the revival of *The Kids in the Hall*, released on May 13, 2022.[50]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nArmisen was married to English singer and songwriter Sally Timms from 1998 to 2004[51] and to actress Elisabeth Moss from 2009 to 2011.[52][53] Moss described their time together as \"extremely traumatic, awful and horrible\". She also said Armisen could be best summed up as follows: \"He's so great at doing impersonations. But the greatest impersonation he does is that of a normal person.\"[54]\n\n\nDuring an interview with Howard Stern, Armisen was quoted as saying, \"I think I was a terrible husband. I think I'm a terrible boyfriend,\" and \"I feel bad for everyone I've gone out with.\"[54]\n\n\nHe started dating actress Natasha Lyonne in 2014.[55][56] Lyonne confirmed that they had ended their relationship in April 2022. She stated, \"We love each other just about as much as two people can love each other and we're still talking all the time.\"[57] Armisen began dating American actress, comedian and musician, Erika \"Riki\" Lindhome in 2022 and they purchased a home together in late 2022 in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California.[58]\n\n\nSince working together on ThunderAnt, Carrie Brownstein and Armisen developed what Brownstein has called \"one of the most intimate, functional, romantic, but nonsexual relationships [they have] ever had.\"[59] According to Armisen, their relationship is \"all of the things that I've ever wanted, you know, aside from like the physical stuff, but the intimacy that I have with her is like no other.\"[60]\n\n\nIn addition to having his own voice work in it, Armisen is a fan of the video game *Red Dead Redemption*.[61] On a 2018 episode of *Larry King Now*, he described himself as being \"very good\" at the game.[62] He is also a fan of black metal and death metal.[63]\n\n\nArmisen has stated that he is an atheist.[64]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n**As a member of Trenchmouth**:\n\n\n\n* *Snakebite [EP]* (1989)\n* *Kick Your Mind And Make It Move [EP]* (1991)\n* *Construction of New Action* (1991)\n* *Trenchmouth / Circus Lupus [Split]* (1992)\n* *Inside the Future* (1993)\n* *The Position of the Right Hand: Trenchmouth / Bliss [Split]* (1993)\n* *Achtung Chicago!

Strong is most notable for being a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series *Saturday Night Live* from 2012 to 2022.[4] She is the longest-tenured female cast member in the show's history.[5]\n\n\nStrong has a starring role in the Apple TV+ musical comedy series *Schmigadoon!* (2021\u20132023), which she also co-produced. Her other roles include voice work on *The Awesomes* (2013\u20132015), supporting roles in films like *Ghostbusters*, *The Meddler*, and *The Female Brain*. She hosted the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2015. Her first book, the memoir *This Will All Be Over Soon*, was published in 2021.\n\n\nFor her work on *Saturday Night Live*, Strong was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 72nd and 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nStrong was born in Springfield, Illinois, and was raised in Oak Park, an inner ring suburb of Chicago.[6] She is the daughter of Penelope and William \"Bill\" Strong, who worked as an Associated Press bureau chief and as of 2013 ran his own public relations firm.[2][6] Penny Legler Strong is a nurse practitioner, having worked extensively at area hospitals. Strong's parents are divorced.[7] Strong grew up adoring *SNL* as a child, reenacting sketches with her friend[8] and watching old *SNL* commercials on VHS. \"I had a tape of the best commercials, and I wore it out, every day.\" She has stated that she was inspired by Phil Hartman.[9]\n\n\nIn a 2021 interview with Terry Gross on the National Public Radio program *Fresh Air*, Strong said that because her uncle is a Broadway producer, as a child she often was able to attend Broadway shows and sometimes go back stage to meet their casts.[10]\n\n\nShe attended Oak Park and River Forest High School until her sophomore year, when she was expelled for bringing marijuana to school. She then attended a private Catholic school until transferring for her senior year to the Chicago Academy for the Arts, where she graduated in 2002.[7][11] She then studied acting at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), graduating in 2006 with a BFA in theatre.[12][13][14] After graduating, Strong returned to Chicago where she studied at the Second City Conservatory and iO Chicago.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nStrong performed regularly at The Second City and iO Chicago.[7] Strong performed on a cruise ship with other Second City members for four months.[15] She appeared at the Chicago Sketch Fest, Chicago Just for Laughs, the New York Sketchfest, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival,[13] the Goodman Theater, the Bailiwick Theater, the Mercury Theater, and with the all-female improv troupe Virgin Daiquiri.[16]\n\n\n\n### *Saturday Night Live*[edit]\n\n\nStrong debuted as a featured player on *Saturday Night Live* on September 15, 2012.[13][17][18] The next season, Strong became a repertory player and co-anchored the recurring *Weekend Update* segment with Seth Meyers, beginning with the season 39 premiere. Strong later co-anchored with Colin Jost,[19] and was replaced on *Weekend Update* with writer Michael Che, beginning with the season 40 premiere in September 2014, partly at her own request to focus on doing sketches as a part of the regular cast.[20] In 2020, Strong was nominated for her first Primetime Emmy award for Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Comedy Series for her work on the show.[21] She was nominated again in 2021.[22] She was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 12th Critics' Choice Television Awards.[23]\n\n\nStrong drew praise from abortion-rights supporters, and strong backlash from abortion opponents, after appearing in a comedy skit, \"Goober the Clown Who Had An Abortion When She Was 23,\" during a *Weekend Update* sketch on the November 6, 2021, episode.[24] The sketch followed U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments in two cases relating to the Texas Heartbeat Act.[25] Strong later confirmed on her Instagram account that the sketch referenced her own abortion.[26] Strong followed up on the commentary a year later, during a *Weekend Update* sketch on the November 5, 2022, episode, appearing as \"Tammy the Trucker on Gas Prices and Definitely Not Abortion\" before the 2022 midterm elections.\n\n\nStrong returned to *SNL* for season 48, and passed former castmate Kate McKinnon as the longest-running female cast member in the show's history,[27] though she missed the first three shows of the season reprising her role in the play *The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe* in Los Angeles.[28] She returned on the October 29, 2022, episode.[29] Strong passed McKinnon's record with the December 17, 2022, episode,[30] her last.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Recurring characters[edit]\n\n\n* The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation with at a Party, an unintelligent, unnamed pseudo-activist,[32]\n* Dana, a loud-mouthed, unfriendly retail employee who along with Niff (played by Bobby Moynihan) always insults her coworkers out of fear of being fired,\n* Donna Fingerneck, The Art of the Encounter and Women in the Workplace co-host with Jodi Cork (played by Kate McKinnon),\n* Heather, a one-dimensional female character from a male-driven comedy,\n* Kyra, co-host of The Girlfriends Talk Show, alongside Morgan (played by Aidy Bryant),\n* Cathy Anne, the drug-addicted neighbor of Michael Che (usually introduced by Che as \"the woman who's always yelling outside my window\"), who has strong opinions on current events,\n* An unnamed blond former porn star-turned-model/commercial actress who hawks elegant items alongside Brecky (played by Vanessa Bayer),\n* Gemma, an aspiring British singer with various boyfriends,\n* Gracelynn Chisholm, co-host of morning show Right Side of the Bed with her husband Cory (played by Taran Killam),\n* Joelle LaRue, one of the two French animal-based video clip show presenters, alongside Noelle LeSoup (played by Kate McKinnon),\n* Lonnie, one of the two unintelligent kids (the other being Josh, played by Mikey Day) in the Science Room sketches.[33][34]\n\n\n#### Celebrity impersonations[edit]\n\n\n* Abby Huntsman\n* Alanis Morissette\n* Anjelica Huston\n* Ariana Grande\n* Brooke Baldwin\n* Christina Aguilera\n* Dianne Feinstein\n* Erin Burnett\n* Fergie\n* Fran Drescher\n* Gretchen Whitmer\n* Hope Hicks\n* Judge Jeanine Pirro\n* Julie Andrews\n* Kari Lake\n* Kate Middleton\n* Kendall Jenner\n* Khloe Kardashian\n* Kimberly Guilfoyle\n* Kyrsten Sinema\n* Lin-Manuel Miranda\n* Liz Cheney\n* Liza Minnelli\n* Marie Yovanovitch\n* Marion Cotillard\n* Marjorie Taylor Greene\n* Marsha Blackburn\n* Megyn Kelly\n* Melania Trump\n* Olivia Colman\n* Rachel Brosnahan\n* Rachel Maddow\n* Rosie Perez\n* Sarah Koenig\n* Sofia Vergara\n* Stormy Daniels\n* Susan Collins\n* Tulsi Gabbard\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nStrong was the featured entertainer at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Association dinner.[35] She took digs at the various news organizations in attendance, politicians of all persuasions, and President Obama.

Starting in 2020 she starred in a series of Prego Spaghetti sauce commercials and in 2022 she was in several Verizon commercials featuring Apple+ TV with several co-stars including Adam Scott and Julian Edelman.\n\n\nHer first book, a memoir titled *This Will All Be Over Soon*, was published on August 10, 2021.[39][40] The book addresses \"the challenges of beginning in a relationship during the pandemic; the pain of losing family and friends; the pivotal events of her life that shaped her; and the importance of gratitude for each passing day.\"[41] It developed from an essay she wrote about grieving the loss of her cousin Owen to brain cancer in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic that was first published on Vulture.com in 2020.[42][43]\n\n\nIn 2021, Strong appeared in HBO Max's six-part comedy series *That Damn Michael Che*, featuring *SNL* castmate Michael Che.[44] The same year, she starred in, and was a producer for, *Schmigadoon!*, a musical parody series on Apple TV+. Developed by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, and produced by *SNL*'s Lorne Michaels, the series centers around a couple (played by Strong and Keegan-Michael Key) stuck in a 1940s studio musical town until they find \"true love\".[45][46]\n\n\nIt was announced in October 2021 that Strong would make her New York stage debut at the end of the year in an Off Broadway revival of Jane Wagner's one-woman play *The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe*, which starred Lily Tomlin in 1985.[47] Directed by Leigh Silverman, the show opened at The Shed on January 11, 2022.[48][49]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Other notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012 | *How to Sponsor a Uterus* | Karen Rigsby | Short film\n |\n| 2015 | *The Bronze* | Janice Townsend |  |\n| 2015 | *Slow Learners* | Amber the ex |  |\n| 2015 | *The Meddler* | Jillian |  |\n| 2015 | *Staten Island Summer* | Mary Ellen |  |\n| 2016 | *The Boss*[50] | Dana Dandridge |  |\n| 2016 | *Ghostbusters* | Jennifer Lynch |  |\n| 2018 | *The Female Brain* | Zoe |  |\n| 2022 | *Sparring Partner* | Woman | Short film\n |\n| 2023 | *Leo* | Mrs. Malkin (voice) | Post-production[51] |\n| 2024 | *The Garfield Movie* | (voice) | In production\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Other notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012\u20132022 | *Saturday Night Live* | Herself, Various | 212 episodes\n |\n| 2012 | *Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday* | Various | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2013\u20132015 | *The Awesomes* | Various Voices | 13 episodes\n |\n| 2015 | *White House Correspondents' Dinner* | Herself (host) | Featured entertainer\n |\n| 2016 | *Angie Tribeca* | Samantha Stevens | Episode: \"Tribeca's Day Off\"\n |\n| 2016 | *Years of Living Dangerously* | Herself | Episode: \"A Race Against Time\"\n |\n| 2016 | *Netflix Presents: The Characters* | Herself | Episode: \"Natasha Rothwell\"\n |\n| 2016 | *Superstore* | Missy Jones | Episode: \"Olympics\"\n |\n| 2016 | *Maya & Marty* | Various | Episode: \"Ricky Gervais and Cecily Strong\"\n |\n| 2016 | *Scream Queens* | Catherine Hobart | Episode: \"Scream Again\"\n |\n| 2017 | *Man Seeking Woman* | CCN Reporter | Episode: \"Horse\"\n |\n| 2017 | *Detroiters* | Roz Chunks | Episode: \"Dream Cruise\"\n |\n| 2017 | *Great News* | Jessica | Episode: \"Night of the Living Screen\"\n |\n| 2018 | *The Simpsons* | Megan Matheson (voice) | Episode: \"Homer Is Where the Art Isn't\"\n |\n| 2018 | *Nature Cat* | Petunia (voice) | Episode: \"Garden Impossible\"\n |\n| 2019 | *RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars* | Herself (guest judge) | Episode: \"Roast in Peace\"\n |\n| 2019 | *I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson* | Brenda | Episode: \"It's the Cigars You Smoke That Is Going to Give You Cancer\"\n |\n| 2020 | *Loafy* | Becca | Main cast\n |\n| 2021 | *That Damn Michael Che* | Woman in elevator | Episode: \"Policin'\"\n |\n| 2021\u2013present | *Schmigadoon!* | Melissa Gimble | Main cast; also producer\n |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Title\n | Result\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Drama League Awards | Distinguished Performance Award\n | *The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe* | Nominated\n | [52] |\n| Grammy Awards | Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media | *Schmigadoon!* | Nominated\n | [53] |\n| 2021 | Critics' Choice Television Awards | Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series | *Saturday Night Live* | Nominated\n | [23] |\n| Primetime Emmy Awards | Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series | Nominated\n | [22] |\n| 2020\n | Nominated\n | [22] |\n| Online Film & Television\nAssociation Awards\n | Best Female Performance\nin a Variety Program\n | Nominated\n | [54] |\n| 2019\n | Nominated\n | [54] |\n| 2014\n | Online Film & Television\nAssociation Awards\n | Best Female Performance\nin a Fiction Program\n | Nominated\n | [54] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"News of the Alumni\" (PDF). *St. Andrew's*.
