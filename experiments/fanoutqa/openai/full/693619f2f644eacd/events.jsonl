He is the founder, executive chairman, and former president and CEO of Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce and cloud computing company. With a net worth of US$162 billion as of November 2023, Bezos is the third-wealthiest person in the world and was the wealthiest from 2017 to 2021, according to both the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index* and *Forbes*.[3][4]\n\n\nBorn in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in mid 1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the largest provider of virtual assistants and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.\n\n\nBezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle reached space in 2015 and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth; he flew into space on Blue Origin NS-16 in 2021. He also purchased the major American newspaper *The Washington Post* in 2013 for $250 million and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. In September 2021, Bezos co-founded the biotechnology company Altos Labs with Mail.ru founder Yuri Milner.[5]\n\n\nThe first centibillionaire on the *Forbes* Real Time Billionaires Index and the second ever to have eclipsed the feat since Bill Gates in 1999,[6] Bezos was named the \"richest man in modern history\" after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018.[7] In August 2020, according to *Forbes*, he had a net worth exceeding $200 billion.[8] In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, his wealth grew by approximately $24 billion.[9] On July 5, 2021, Bezos stepped down as the CEO and president of Amazon and took over the role of executive chairman. Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy succeeded Bezos as the CEO and president of Amazon. In September 2022, he was ranked second on the *Forbes* 400 list of wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of $151 billion.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBezos was born \"Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen\" on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico,[10] as the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Ted Jorgensen.[11] At the time of Jeff's birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high-school student and his father was 19-years-old.[12] Jorgensen was a Danish American unicyclist[13] born in Chicago to a family of Baptists.[14] After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school, bringing her baby with her.[15] Jeff attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque when he was 2-years-old.[16]\n\n\nTed Jorgensen drank and struggled financially.[17] Jacklyn left her husband to live with her parents, filing for divorce in June 1965 when Jeff was 17-months-old.[18] After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel \"Mike\" Bezos in April 1968.[19] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jeff, whose surname was then legally changed from Jorgensen to Bezos.[20] Gise, her husband and her son left the area and asked Jorgensen to discontinue contact, to which he agreed.[21]\n\n\nAfter Mike had received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston, Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon.[22] Jeff attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[23] Jeff's maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[24] Lawrence retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Jeff would spend many summers in his youth.[25] Jeff would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha).[26][27] Jeff displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[28][29] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Jeff attended Miami Palmetto High School.[30][31] While Jeff was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[32]\n\n\nBezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[33][34] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[33] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park\".[35]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1982, Bezos attended Princeton University. He initially majored in physics but later switched to electrical engineering and computer science.[36] Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[37] In addition, he was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[38][39] He had a 4.2 GPA and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi. Bezos graduated from Princeton in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE), *summa cum laude*.[40]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[41] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[42] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust from 1988 to 1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly created hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[43][41]\n\n\n\n### Amazon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon\n\n![](image)Bezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005\nIn spring 1994, Bezos read that web usage was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and eventually decided to establish an online bookstore.[44] He and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage in Bellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[45][46] With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[47] Prior to settling in Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at an Indian reservation near San Francisco in order to avoid paying taxes.[48] Bezos initially named his new company *Cadabra* but later changed the name to *Amazon* after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter *A*, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[49] At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with \"A\" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[50] In addition, he regarded \"Amazon,\" the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[50] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as an investment in Amazon.[46][51][52] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[53] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[43][49] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[54] In response to critical reports from *Fortune* and *Barron's*, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.[49]\n\n\nIn 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of other consumer goods.[49] Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance the aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[49] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[55] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[49] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[56] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[55] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[57][*failed verification*] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[58] According to a 2008 *Time* profile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a \"flow state\" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[59] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[60] In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bezos in 2010\nIn May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[62] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[63] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[64] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[65] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[66] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2 billion.[67] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[68] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by *Forbes* on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bezos receives the James Smithson Bicentennial medal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[70]\nIn March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company's supply chain routes.[71] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[72] Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[73] Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[74] During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon's face recognition software, Rekognition.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit to Los Angeles Air Force Base.[76]\nCriticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.[77] This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps.[78] While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: \"Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?\"[79] He later said: \"Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.\"[80] Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary \"misleading\" as it included part-time workers.[81] However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[82] On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[83] The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.[84]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Bezos announced that in the third quarter of 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO by Andy Jassy.[85][86][87] On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[88] to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him \"the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and [his] other passions.\"[89]\n\n\n\n### Blue Origin[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blue Origin\n\n![](image)Bezos and Rob Meyerson (fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver (fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter meets with Bezos in 2016 at The Pentagon.\nIn September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup.[90] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[34] His 1982 high school valedictorian senior graduation speech was followed up with a *Miami Herald* interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[91] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[92] Rob Meyerson led Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[93]\n\n\nAfter its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[94] After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[95] In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[96] After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his \"lucky\" Texas Cowboy boots to all rocket launches.[97] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[98] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[99]\n\n\nIn 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[100] Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[101] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[102]\n\n\nIn December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[103] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[104] Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[105][106] In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary.[107] He announced that *New Shepard* would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[107] In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[108]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2021, he launched on the NS-16 mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos, Wally Funk, and Oliver Daemen.[109] He launched nine days after Richard Branson launched onboard the Virgin Galactic Unity 22 mission. Bezos's suborbital flight lasted over 10 minutes, reaching a peak altitude of 66.5 miles (107.0 km).[110]\n\n\n\n### *The Washington Post*[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Washington Post\n\nOn August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of *The Washington Post* for $250 million in cash,[111] at the suggestion of his friend, Don Graham.[112] To execute the sale, he established limited liability company **Nash Holdings** to serve as a holding company through which he would own the newspaper.[113] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[114] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at *The Washington Post* and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[115] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[116] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[117]\n\n\n\n### Bezos Expeditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bezos Expeditions\n\nBezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[118] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[119][120] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[121] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, GRAIL, Juno Therapeutics, and Zocdoc.[122] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos's role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[123][124]\n\n\nBezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[125] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[126][127] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[128] They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July 1969.[129][130] The engines are currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Altos Labs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Altos Labs\n\nIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs with Mail.ru founder Yuri Milner. Altos Labs is a well-funded biotechnology company dedicated to harnessing cellular reprogramming to develop longevity therapeutics.[5] The company has recruited prominent scientists such as Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte (known for work on rejuvenation through reprogramming), Steve Horvath (known for work in epigenetic aging clocks), and Shinya Yamanaka (the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of cellular reprogramming in mammalian cells).[5]\n\n\nThe company left stealth mode and launched on January 19, 2022, with a start capital of $3 billion and an executive team led by Hal Barron.[133]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bezos at a naturalization ceremony on June 14, 2016\nJournalist Nellie Bowles of *The New York Times* has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of \"a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan\".[134] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[134][135] Journalist Mark O'Connell criticized Bezos's relentless customer focus as \"very small\" in terms of impact on humanity as a whole,[136] a sentiment technologist Tim O'Reilly agreed with.[137] His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. In 1999, Bezos was worth $10 billion yet drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[138] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[139][140][141]\n\n\nBezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[142][143] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as \"talking in lists\" and \"[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made.\"[139] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote a book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive,[135][142] and opined that Bezos perhaps \"bet the biggest on the Internet\" than anyone else.[144] Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[145][146]\n\n\nDuring the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[147] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[148][149] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising supervillain.[150][151][152] Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on *Saturday Night Live*, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[153][*better source needed*] In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the \"World's Worst Boss\", with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: \"Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model\",[154] while in 2019, Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's \"relatively low ESG (environment, social, and governance) scores\" that reflect \"risks created by working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues.\"[155]\n\n\nDuring the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[26] His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[156][26] Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a *New York Times* piece.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Leadership style[edit]\n\n\n\"Day 1\" Management Philosophy\n\n\n> \n> Day 1: start up  \n> Day 2: stasis  \n> Day 3: irrelevance  \n> Day 4: \"excruciating, painful decline\"  \n> Day 5: death\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nBezos has stated \"it is always Day 1\" to describe his growth mindset.[159][160]\nBezos used what he called a \"regret-minimization framework\" while he worked at D. E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon. He described this life philosophy by stating: \"When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes.\"[161] During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[36] To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra \"Get Big Fast\", establishing the company's need to scale its operations to produce market dominance.[49] He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.[139]\n\n\nBezos uses the term \"work–life harmony\" instead of the more standard \"work–life balance\" because he believes that *balance* implies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[162] Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique should not do anything new or interesting \"The Bezos Principle\".[163] Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for two pizzas to feed everyone in the boardroom.[164] When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[165]\n\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[164] Instead of using presentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[166] Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks for market leadership; facilitate staff morale; build a company culture; and empower people.[167][168] Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[169] as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives, who then attempt to address the issues.[170] Bezos has cited Jeff Immelt of New Enterprise Associates,[171] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and Bob Iger of The Walt Disney Company as major influences on his leadership style.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\n* In 1999, Bezos received his first major award when *Time* named him Person of the Year.[173]\n* In 2008, he was selected by *U.S. News & World Report* as one of America's best leaders.[174]\n* Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008.[175]\n* In 2011, *The Economist* gave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for the Amazon Kindle.[176]\n* In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year by *Fortune*.[177]\n* He is also a member of the Bilderberg Group and attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland,[178] and the 2013 conference in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. He was a member of the executive committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.[179]\n* 2014–2018, he was ranked the best-performing CEO in the world by *Harvard Business Review*.[155]\n* He has also figured in *Fortune*'s list of 50 great leaders of the world for three straight years, topping the list in 2015.[180]\n* In September 2016, Bezos received a $250,000 prize for winning the Heinlein Prize for Advances in Space Commercialization,[181] which he donated to the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[182][*better source needed*]\n* In February 2018, Bezos was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for \"leadership and innovation in space exploration, autonomous systems, and building a commercial pathway for human space flight\".[183]\n* In March 2018, at the Explorers Club annual dinner, he was awarded the Buzz Aldrin Space Exploration Award in recognition of his work with Blue Origin.[184]\n* He received Germany's 2018 Axel Springer Award for Business Innovation and Social Responsibility.[185] *Time* magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world on five separate occasions between 2008 and 2018.[186]\n* In 2019, Bezos was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation, being awarded with the Jeff Bezos Freedom's Wings Award and the Kenn Ricci Lifetime Aviation Entrepreneur Award.[187]\n* In February 2023, Bezos was presented with the Légion d'honneur, the highest French order of merit. Bezos had been designated a member of the Légion d'Honneur about 10 years earlier but was not available to collect it.[188]\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Annual estimates of Jeff Bezos's net worth[a] |\n| Year\n | Billions\n | Change\n | Year\n | Billions\n | Change\n |\n| 1999\n | 10.1\n | ![Steady](image) 0.0%\n | 2009\n | 6.8\n | ![Decrease](image) 17.1%\n |\n| 2000\n | 6.1\n | ![Decrease](image) 40.5%\n | 2010\n | 12.6\n | ![Increase](image) 85.3%\n |\n| 2001\n | 2.0\n | ![Decrease](image) 66.6%\n | 2011\n | 18.1\n | ![Increase](image) 43.7%\n |\n| 2002\n | 1.5\n | ![Decrease](image) 25.0%\n | 2012\n | 23.2\n | ![Increase](image) 28.2%\n |\n| 2003\n | 2.5\n | ![Increase](image) 66.6%\n | 2013\n | 28.9\n | ![Increase](image) 24.5%\n |\n| 2004\n | 5.1\n | ![Increase](image) 104%\n | 2014\n | 30.5\n | ![Increase](image) 5.5%\n |\n| 2005\n | 4.1\n | ![Decrease](image) 19.6%\n | 2015\n | 50.3\n | ![Increase](image) 60.9%\n |\n| 2006\n | 4.3\n | ![Increase](image) 5.1%\n | 2016\n | 45.2\n | ![Decrease](image) 10.1%\n |\n| 2007\n | 8.7\n | ![Increase](image) 102.3%\n | 2017\n | 72.8\n | ![Increase](image) 61.6%\n |\n| 2008\n | 8.2\n | ![Decrease](image) 5.7%\n | 2018\n | 112.0\n | ![Increase](image) 53.8%\n |\n| Main data source: *Forbes* *World's Billionaires Estimates*\nAdditional reference(s): *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*\n |\n\n\nBezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54 million through Amazon's initial public offering (IPO).[189] He was first included on the *Forbes* *World's Billionaires* list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1 billion, which placed his on the 19th position in the world and 10th in the USA.[190] His net worth decreased to $6.1 billion a year later, a 40.5% drop.[191] His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0 billion.[192] He lost $500 million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5 billion.[193] The following year, his net worth increased by 66.66% to $2.5 billion.[194] From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7 billion.[195] After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would decrease to $6.8 billion—a 17.7% drop.[196][197] His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6 billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.[196][198]\n\n\nAfter a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos's net worth rose to $30.5 billion in 2014.[199][200] A year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3 billion. Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7 billion in one hour.[201] By the time the *Forbes* list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2 billion.[202] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2 billion to $66.5 billion, unofficially ranking him the third-richest person in the world, behind Warren Buffett.[203] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The net worth of Jeff Bezos from 1999 to 2018 as estimated by *Forbes* magazine, in the nominal U.S. dollar. His net worth is calculated in the billions by March of each year.\nBezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's share price fluctuated.[205] His net worth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's share price increased by more than 2.5%.[206] When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos's net worth was registered at $72.8 billion, adding $27.6 billion from the previous year.[207] His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24 billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual gross domestic product of Kyrgyzstan.[208]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2018, Bezos was designated the wealthiest person in the world, with a registered net worth of $112 billion.[209] He unseated Bill Gates ($90 billion), who was $6 billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84 billion), ranked third.[210] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[b]\n\n\nHis wealth, in 2017–18 terms, equaled that of 2.7 million Americans.[215] Bezos's net worth increased by $33.6 billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world.[216] During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds.[217] *The Motley Fool* estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181 billion in 2018.[218] According to *Quartz*, his net worth of $150 billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran.[219] Following the report by *Quartz*, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers.[220] On July 17, 2018, he was designated the \"wealthiest person in modern history\"[c] by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[223] *Fortune*,[224] *MarketWatch*,[225] *The Wall Street Journal*,[226] and *Forbes*.[222]\n\n\nIn 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by the divorce from his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[227][228] According to *Forbes*, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos's wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife;[229][230] however, she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36 billion, making her the third-richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in *The Washington Post* and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.[231]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of US$80 million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019.[232] Bezos had also purchased three adjoining apartments at 25 Central Park West in Manhattan for $7.65 million in 1999;[233][234] he bought a fourth unit in that building for $5.3 million in 2012.[234]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bezos purchased the Warner Estate from David Geffen for $165 million,[235][236] a record price paid for a residence in the Los Angeles area. The previous record high price of $150 million was paid by Lachlan Murdoch for the Chartwell Mansion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported that Bezos's fortune had grown by $24 billion, citing a surge in demand from households on lockdown shopping on Amazon.[9] He further expanded his residential holdings in February 2022, purchasing a $16.13-million-dollar apartment at a 24-story boutique condominium, located across from Madison Square Park in the Flatiron neighbourhood, where he already owns all the units on the top floors.[237] Bezos is the owner of the *Y721*, a luxury superyacht estimated to cost more than $500,000,000; it is the largest yacht in the world.[238]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nBezos is known for creating an adversarial environment at Amazon, as well as insulting and verbally abusing his employees. As journalist Brad Stone revealed in his book *The Everything Store*, Bezos issued remarks to his employees such as \"I'm sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?\", \"Are you lazy or just incompetent?\", and \"Why are you ruining my life?\".[145] Additionally, Bezos reportedly pitted Amazon teams against each other, and once declined to give Amazon employees city bus passes in order to discourage them from leaving the office.[145]\n\n\nThroughout his early years of ownership of *The Washington Post*, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[239] Bezos and the newspaper's editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper's content and Bezos maintains the paper's independence.[240][117] Bezos treatment of employees at *The Washington Post* has also drawn scrutiny.[241] In 2018, more than 400 *Washington Post* employees wrote an open letter to Bezos criticizing his poor wages and benefits for his employees. The letter demanded \"Fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security\".[241]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Family of Jeff Bezos\n\n![](image)Bezos in 2017\nIn 1992, Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan when he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later.[43][242] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[243] Bezos and his now ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons and one daughter adopted from China.[92][244]\n\n\nIn March 2003, Bezos was a passenger in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas while surveying land to buy for Blue Origin; the other 3 occupants in the helicopter were pilot Charles \"Cheater\" Bella, Amazon lawyer Elizabeth Korrell, and local rancher Ty Holland.[245][246] All survived; Bezos sustained only minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[36]\n\n\nBezos portrayed a Starfleet official in the 2016 movie *Star Trek Beyond*, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[247] He had lobbied Paramount for the role apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition. His one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress: \"Speak Normally.\" In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create \"the *Star Trek* computer.\"[248] Bezos's family corporation Zefram LLC is named after Zefram Cochrane, a character from *Star Trek*.[249]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bezos and his wife Mackenzie released a joint statement which revealed that they would be getting divorced after 25 years together.[250][251][252] Subsequently, *National Enquirer* revealed that Bezos had an affair with media personality Lauren Sánchez; the affair with Sanchez had lasted for months.[253][254] Later, Bezos published an online essay on February 7, 2019, in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of \"extortion and blackmail\" for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and current girlfriend Lauren Sánchez[255] if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the *National Enquirer*.[256][257] Media reports have accused Sanchez's brother Michael of being the source for the photos obtained by *National Enquirer*; however, Bezos has speculated that it may have been the Saudi Arabian government.[258]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6 billion) in Amazon stock. However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[259] On May 22, 2023, Sánchez and Bezos became engaged.[260] He is the Honorary Chair of the Explorers Club.[261]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi presenting the USIBC Global Leadership Award to Bezos, in Washington, D.C. on June 7, 2016\n![](image)British Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets with Bezos during the United Nations General Assembly, in New York City on September 20, 2021.\nAccording to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported Democrats U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Republican Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues.[262] Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5 million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state.[263] Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for \"top earners\".[262] In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC),[262] which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.[264]\n\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump's Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department.[60][265] Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading \"fake news\".[266][267][268][269]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600 million.[270] A 2018, $10 billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon.[271] Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon.[272] In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased.[273][274] On July 6, 2021, the Pentagon cancelled the JEDI contract with Microsoft, citing that \"due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.\"[275] Despite Bezos's support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[276]\n\n\nIn 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1 million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the reelection bid of Seattle city council member and activist Kshama Sawant.[277]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2021, Jeff Bezos donated $100 million to the Obama Foundation to \"help expand the scope of programming that reaches emerging leaders\", and requested the Obama Presidential Center's plaza to be named after John Lewis.[278][279]\n\n\n\n### Saudi hacking claim[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jeff Bezos phone hacking\n\nIn March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[280] In March 2019, Bezos's security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos's phone. According to BBC, Bezos's top security staffer, Gavin de Becker,[281] \"linked the hack to the *Washington Post*'s coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\". Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the *Washington Post*, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[282]\n\n\nIn January 2020, *The Guardian* reported that the hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the *Washington Post*. Forensic analysis of Bezos's mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it \"highly probable\" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018.[283][284] Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[285]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bezos funded the retrieval of these F-1 engine parts from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 2015, eventually donating them to the Seattle Museum of Flight. They are from Apollo 16 (above) and Apollo 12 (below).\nBezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017.[286] In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee.[287]\n\n\nIn September 2018, *Business Insider* reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourages wealthy people to give away a majority of their wealth.[288] That same month, Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos's new § Day 1 Fund, including the fund's structure and how exactly it will be funded.[289]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Bezos gave $1 million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists.[290] On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: \"I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time—working on the long term\".[26] At the time of the post, Bezos's lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100 million.[26] Multiple opinion columnists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers.[291][292] A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018.[293] Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2 billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities.[294] As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the \"Day 1 Families Fund\" to finance \"night shelters and day care centers for homeless families\" and the \"Day 1 Academies Fund\" for early childhood education.[295][296]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Bezos made a $33 million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.[297][*better source needed*] In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy.[298] In September 2018, Bezos donated $10 million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.[299]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bezos pledged $10 billion to combat climate change through the Bezos Earth Fund.[300][301][302] Later that year, in November, Bezos announced $791M of donations to established, well-known groups, with $100M each going to Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund, and the remainder going to 11 other groups.[303][304][305] In April 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Bezos donated $100 million to food banks through Feeding America.[9][306][307] In November 2021, Bezos pledged to donate $2 billion towards restructuring food systems and nature conservation at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.[308]\n\n\nBezos Academy is a group of tuition-free preschools for students from low-income families, which was created by Bezos, and which operate in a manner similar to the Montessori method.[309]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Bezos granted a $100-million Courage and Civility Award to singer Dolly Parton in recognition of her charity work focused on improving children's literacy around the world.[310]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2022, Jeff Bezos awarded $123 million to organizations that are engaged in relocating homeless families to permanent housing. Day 1 Families Fund grants, the amounts of which vary in monetary terms, will be sent to 40 organizations across the country.[311]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Princeton University alumni\n* List of richest Americans in history\n* List of *Time* Person of the Year recipients\n* The World's Billionaires\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** All currency figures expressed in the United States dollar (US$) in nominal terms.\n2. **^** Although Bill Gates momentarily surpassed the $100 billion net worth mark in April 1999 before the Dot-com bubble,[211] Bezos was the first to register $100 billion with major wealth indexes and has retained the wealth for longer than Gates's three weeks.[212][213][214]\n3. **^** Many calculations of Bezos's wealth during the late 2010s were not adjusted for inflation. When he was designated the \"world wealthiest person\" on March 6, 2018, the *Forbes* The World's Billionaires list stipulated that although Bezos was the first centi-billionaire (i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it was Bill Gates who had the most money when taken in real terms.[221] In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[222]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999). \"Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com\". *The New York Times*.

He was Oracle's chief executive officer from 1977 to 2014 and is now its chief technology officer and executive chairman.\n\n\nAs of November 2023, he was listed by *Bloomberg Billionaires Index* as the sixth-wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated fortune of $122 billion.[2] Ellison is also known for his ownership of 98% of Lanai, the sixth-largest island in the Hawaiian Archipelago.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nEllison was born on August 17, 1944, in New York City to Florence Spellman, an unwed Jewish mother.[4][5][6][7] His biological father was an Italian-American United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption.[7] He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48.[8]\n\n\nEllison moved to Chicago's South Shore, then a middle-class neighborhood.[9] He remembers his adoptive mother, Lillian Spellman Ellison,[10] as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chosen the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.[7]\n\n\nAlthough Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration.[11] Ellison states: \"While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff.\"[12] Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.[13]\n\n\nEllison attended South Shore High School in Chicago[14] and later was admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and was enrolled as a premed student.[14] At the university, he was named science student of the year.[15][16] He withdrew without taking final exams after his sophomore year because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending the summer of 1966 in California, he then attended the University of Chicago for one term, where he studied physics and mathematics[14] and also first encountered computer design. He then moved to Berkeley, California and began his career as a computer programmer for different companies.[10]\n\n\n\n## Early career and Oracle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Larry Ellison lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010\nWhile working at Ampex in the early 1970s, he became influenced by Edgar F. Codd's research on relational database design for IBM.[17] This white paper led in 1977 to the formation of the company which later became Oracle. Oracle became a successful database vendor to mid- and low-range systems, later competing with Sybase (created 1984) and Microsoft SQL Server (a port of Sybase created in 1989) which led to Ellison being listed by *Forbes* as one of the richest people in the world.\n\n\n\n### 1977–1994[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, after a brief stint at Amdahl Corporation, Ellison began working for Ampex Corporation. His projects included a database for the CIA, which he named \"Oracle\".[18] Ellison was inspired by a paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database systems called \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".[19] In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.\n\n\nIn 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc. Ellison had heard about the IBM System R database, also based on Codd's theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R's code. The initial release of the Oracle Database in 1979 was called Oracle version 2; there was no Oracle version 1.[20] In 1983, the company officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product. In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its workforce (about 400 people) because it was losing money.[21] This crisis, which almost resulted in the company's bankruptcy, came about because of Oracle's \"up-front\" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and had to settle class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison would later say that Oracle had made \"an incredible business mistake\".[22]\n\n\nAlthough IBM dominated the mainframe relational database market with its DB2 and SQL/DS database products, it delayed entering the market for a relational database on Unix and Windows operating systems. This left the door open for Sybase, Oracle, Informix, and eventually Microsoft to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers. Around this time, Oracle fell behind Sybase. From 1990 to 1993, Sybase was the fastest-growing database company and the database industry's darling vendor, but soon it fell victim to merger mania. Sybase's 1996 merger with Powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which now markets it under the name \"SQL Server\".\n\n\nIn his early years at Oracle, Ellison was named an Award Recipient in the High Technology Category for the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Program.[23]\n\n\n\n### 1994–2010[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ellison in 2009\nIn 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison was front-page Silicon Valley news for three years. In April 1997, Informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements. Phil White eventually landed in jail, and IBM absorbed Informix in 2001. Also in 1997, Ellison was made a director of Apple Computer after Steve Jobs returned to the company. Ellison resigned in 2002. With the defeat of Informix and of Sybase, Oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of Microsoft SQL Server in the late 1990s and IBM's acquisition of Informix Software in 2001 to complement their DB2 database. As of 2013[update] Oracle's main competition for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems comes from IBM's DB2 and from Microsoft SQL Server. IBM's DB2 still dominates the mainframe database market.\n\n\nIn 2005, Ellison agreed to settle a four-year-old insider-trading lawsuit by offering to pay $100 million to charity in Oracle's name.[24]\n\n\nIn 2005, Oracle Corporation paid Ellison a $975,000 salary, a $6,500,000 bonus, and other compensation of $955,100.[25] In 2007, Ellison earned a total compensation of $61,180,524, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $8,369,000, and options granted of $50,087,100.[26] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $84,598,700, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $10,779,000, no stock grants, and options granted of $71,372,700.[27] In the year ending May 31, 2009, he made $56.8 million.[28] In 2006, *Forbes* ranked him as the richest Californian.[29] In April 2009, after a tug-of-war with IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Oracle announced its intent to buy Sun Microsystems.[30] On July 2, 2009, for the fourth year in a row, Oracle's board awarded Ellison another 7 million stock options.[31] On August 22, 2009, it was reported that Ellison would be paid only $1 for his base salary for the fiscal year of 2010, down from the $1,000,000 he was paid in fiscal 2009.[28][32]\n\n\n\n### 2010–present[edit]\n\n\nThe European Union approved Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 21, 2010, and agreed that Oracle's acquisition of Sun \"has the potential to revitalize important assets and create new and innovative products\".[33] The Sun acquisition also gave Oracle control of the popular MySQL open source database, which Sun had acquired in 2008.[34] On August 9, 2010, Ellison denounced Hewlett-Packard's board for firing CEO Mark Hurd, writing that: \"The HP board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.\" (Ellison and Hurd were close personal friends.)[35] Then on September 6, Oracle hired Mark Hurd as co-president alongside Safra Catz. Ellison remained in his current role at Oracle.[36]\n\n\nIn March 2010, the *Forbes* list of billionaires ranked Ellison as the sixth-richest person in the world and as the third-richest American, with an estimated net worth of US$28 billion.[29] On July 27, 2010, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Ellison was the best-paid executive in the last decade, collecting a total compensation of US$1.84 billion.[37] In September 2011, Ellison was listed on the *Forbes* list of billionaires as the fifth richest man in the world and was still the third richest American, with a net worth of about $36.5 billion. In September 2012, Ellison was again listed on the *Forbes* list of billionaires as the third richest American citizen, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $44 billion. In October 2012, he was listed just behind David Hamilton Koch as the eighth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[38] Ellison owns stakes in Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Quark Biotechnology Inc. and Astex Pharmaceuticals.[39][40] In June 2012, Ellison agreed to buy 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai from David Murdock's company, Castle & Cooke. The price was reported to be between $500 million and $600 million.[41] In 2013, according to *The Wall Street Journal*, Ellison earned $94.6 million.[42] On September 18, 2014, Ellison appointed Mark Hurd to CEO of Oracle from his former position as president; Safra Catz was also made CEO, moving from her former role as CFO. Ellison assumed the positions of chief technology officer and executive chairman.[43][44]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Oracle bought NetSuite for $9.3 billion. Ellison owned 35% of NetSuite at the time of the purchase making him $3.5 billion personally.[45]\n\n\nIn 2017, *Forbes* estimated that Ellison was the 4th richest person in tech.[46]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Ellison's net worth was about $54.5 billion, according to *Forbes*.[47]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Ellison became a director on the board of Tesla, Inc., after purchasing 3 million shares earlier that year.[48][49] Ellison left the Tesla Board in August 2022.[50]\n\n\nAs of June 2020, Ellison is said to be the seventh wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $66.8 billion.[51]\n\n\nAs of 2022, Ellison owns 42.9 percent of the shares of Oracle Corporation,[52] and as of June 2023, 1.4 percent of the shares of Tesla.[53]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nEllison has been married and divorced four times:[54]\n\n\n\n* Adda Quinn from 1967 to 1974\n* Nancy Wheeler Jenkins from 1977 to 1978. They married six months before Ellison founded Software Development Laboratories. In 1978, the couple divorced. Wheeler gave up any claim on her husband's company for $500.\n* Barbara Boothe from 1983 to 1986. Boothe was a former receptionist at Relational Software Inc. (RSI).[*citation needed*] They had two children, David and Megan, who are film producers at Skydance Media and Annapurna Pictures, respectively.[55]\n* Melanie Craft, a romance novelist, from 2003 to 2010. They married on December 18, 2003, at his Woodside estate. Ellison's friend Steve Jobs, former CEO and co-founder of Apple Inc., was the official wedding photographer,[56] and Representative Tom Lantos officiated. They divorced in 2010.[57]\n\n\nEllison made a brief cameo appearance in the 2010 movie *Iron Man 2*.[58] In 2010, Ellison purchased a 50% share of the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament.[59] Ellison owns many exotic cars, including an Audi R8 and a McLaren F1. His favorite is the Acura NSX, which he was known to give as gifts each year during its production.[40] Ellison is also reportedly the owner of a Lexus LFA.[60]\n\n\n\n### Yachts[edit]\n\n\nWith the economic downturn of 2010, Ellison sold his share of *Rising Sun*, the 12th largest yacht in the world, making David Geffen the sole owner.[61] The vessel is 453 feet (138 metres) long,[62] and reportedly cost over $200 million to build. He downsized to *Musashi*, a 288-foot (88-metre) yacht built by Feadship.[63]\n\n\nEllison competes in yachting through Oracle Team USA.[64] Following success racing Maxi yachts, Ellison founded BMW Oracle Racing to compete for the 2003 Louis Vuitton Cup.\n\n\nIn 2002, Ellison's Oracle's team introduced kite yachting into the America's Cup environment. Kite sail flying lasting about 30 minutes was achieved during testing in New Zealand.[65]\n\n\nBMW Oracle Racing was the \"Challenger of Record\" on behalf of the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco for the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, Spain, until eliminated from the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup challenger-selection series in the semi-finals. On February 14, 2010, Ellison's yacht *USA 17* won the second race (in the best of three \"deed of gift\" series) of the 33rd America's Cup, after winning the first race two days earlier. Securing a historic victory, Ellison and his BMW Oracle team became the first challengers to win a \"deed of gift\" match. The Cup returned to American shores for the first time since 1995. Ellison served as a crew member in the second race.[66] Previously, Ellison had filed several legal challenges, through the Golden Gate Yacht Club, against the way that Ernesto Bertarelli (also one of the world's richest men) proposed to organize the 33rd America's Cup following the 2007 victory of Bertarelli's team Alinghi.[66][67] The races were finally held[*clarification needed*] in February 2010 in Valencia.\n\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Ellison's Oracle Team USA defeated Emirates Team New Zealand to win the 34th America's Cup in San Francisco Bay, California.[68] Oracle Team USA had been penalized two points in the final for cheating by some team members during the America's Cup World Series warm-up events.[69] The Oracle team came from a 1–8 deficit to win 9–8, in what has been called \"one of the greatest comebacks in sports history\".[70]\n\n\nOracle Racing lost the 2017 America's Cup to Team New Zealand.\n\n\nIn 2019, Ellison, in conjunction with Russell Coutts, started the SailGP international racing series.[71] The series used F50 foiling catamarans, the fastest class of boat in history with regattas held across the globe. Ellison committed to five years of funding to support the series until it could become self sustaining. The first season was successful with global audiences of over 1.8 billion.[72][73][74]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nEllison is a licensed pilot who has owned several aircraft.[8] He was cited by the city of San Jose, California, for violating its limits on late-night takeoffs and landings from San Jose Mineta International Airport by planes weighing more than 75,000 pounds (34,019 kg). In January 2000, Ellison sued over the interpretation of the airport rule, contending that his Gulfstream V aircraft \"is certified by the manufacturer to fly at two weights: 75,000 pounds, and at 90,000 pounds for heavier loads or long flights requiring more fuel. But the pilot only lands the plane in San Jose when it weighs 75,000 pounds or less, and has the logs to prove it.\"[75] US District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled in Ellison's favor in June 2001, calling for a waiver for Ellison's jet, but did not invalidate the curfew.[76]\n\n\nEllison also owns at least two military jets: the Italian training aircraft SIAI-Marchetti S.211, and a decommissioned Soviet fighter MiG-29, which the US government has refused him permission to import.[8]\n\n\n\n### Tennis[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Ellison purchased the Indian Wells Tennis Garden tennis facility in California's Coachella Valley and the Indian Wells Masters tournament for $100 million, and has subsequently invested another $100 million into the club.[77]\n\n\n\n### Homes[edit]\n\n\nEllison styled his estimated $110 million Woodside, California, estate after feudal Japanese architecture, complete with a man-made 2.3-acre (0.93 ha) lake and an extensive seismic retrofit.[78] In 2004 and 2005 he purchased more than 12 properties in Malibu, California, worth more than $180 million. The $65 million Ellison spent on five contiguous lots at Malibu's Carbon Beach made this the most costly residential transaction in United States history until banker Ronald Perelman sold his Palm Beach, Florida, compound for $70 million later that same year.[79] His entertainment system at his Pacific Heights home cost $1 million, and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool, using the gaping hole as a giant subwoofer.[80][81]\n\n\nIn early 2010, Ellison purchased the Astors' Beechwood Mansion – formerly the summer home of the Astor family – in Newport, Rhode Island, for $10.5 million.[82]\n\n\nIn 2011 he purchased the 249-acre Porcupine Creek Estate and private golf course in Rancho Mirage, California, for $42.9 million.[82] The property was formerly the home of Yellowstone Club founders Edra and Tim Blixseth, and was sold to Ellison by creditors following their divorce and bankruptcy.[83]\n\n\nIn December 2020, he left California and moved to Lanai, of which he owns 98%.[84]\n\n\nIn 2022, Ellison bought a 22-acre property in Manalapan, Florida for $173 million. He purchased it from Jim Clark, who in turn had acquired it from the Ziff family. It is the most expensive residential property purchase in Florida history.[85]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992 Ellison shattered his elbow in a high-speed bicycle crash. After receiving treatment at University of California, Davis, Ellison donated $5 million to seed the Lawrence J. Ellison Musculo-Skeletal Research Center. In 1998, the Lawrence J. Ellison Ambulatory Care Center opened on the Sacramento campus of the UC Davis Medical Center.[86]\n\n\nTo settle an insider trading lawsuit arising from his selling nearly $1 billion of Oracle stock, a court allowed Ellison to donate $100 million to his own charitable foundation without admitting wrongdoing. A California judge refused to allow Oracle to pay Ellison's legal fees of $24 million. Ellison's lawyer had argued that if Ellison were to pay the fees, that could be construed as an admission of guilt. His charitable donations to Stanford University raised questions about the independence of two Stanford professors who evaluated the case's merits for Oracle.[87] In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, Ellison made a controversial offer to donate software to the federal government[88] that would have enabled it to build and run a national identification database and to issue ID cards.[89]\n\n\n*Forbes*' 2004 list of charitable donations made by the wealthiest 400 Americans stated that Ellison had donated[*when?*] $151,092,103, about 1% of his estimated personal wealth.[90] In June 2006, Ellison announced he would not honor his earlier pledge of $115 million to Harvard University, claiming it was due to the departure of former president Lawrence Summers. Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne announced, \"It was really Larry Summers' brainchild and once it looked like Larry Summers was leaving, Larry Ellison reconsidered ... [I]t was Larry Ellison and Larry Summers that had initially come up with this notion.\"[91] In 2007 Ellison pledged $500,000 to fortify a community centre in Sderot, Israel, after discovering that the building was not fortified against rocket attacks.[92] Other charitable donations by Ellison include a $10 million donation to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces in 2014.[93] In 2017 Ellison again donated to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, this time for $16.6 million. His donation was intended to support the construction of well-being facilities on a new campus for co-ed conscripts.[94]\n\n\nIn August 2010 a report listed Ellison as one of the 40 billionaires who had signed \"The Giving Pledge\".[95][96]\n\n\nIn May 2016 Ellison donated $200 million to the University of Southern California for establishing a cancer research center: the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC.[97]\n\n\n\n## Political involvement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ellison (right) with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2020\nEllison was critical of NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, saying that \"Snowden had yet to identify a single person who had been 'wrongly injured' by the NSA's data collection\".[98] In 2012, he donated to both Democratic and Republican politicians,[99] and in late 2014 hosted Republican senator Rand Paul at a fundraiser at his home.[100][101]\n\n\nEllison was one of the top donors to Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC supporting Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential bid. As of February 2016, Ellison had given $4 million overall to the PAC.[102] In 2020, Ellison allowed former president Donald Trump to have a fundraiser at his Rancho Mirage estate,[103][104] but Ellison was not present.[105] In January 2022, Ellison donated $15 million to the Opportunity Matters Fund super PAC associated with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which is one of the most significant financial contributions of the 2022 election cycle.[106]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in May 2022 that Ellison participated in a conference call days after the 2020 presidential election that focused on strategies for challenging the legitimacy of the vote. Other participants on the call included Fox News host Sean Hannity, senator Lindsey Graham, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow and James Bopp, an attorney for True the Vote. The *Post* cited court documents and a participant on the call.[107]\n\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, Ellison received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[108][109]\n\n\nIn 2013, Ellison was inducted into the Bay Area Business Hall of Fame.[110]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC honored Ellison with the first Rebels With A Cause Award in recognition of his generous support through the years.[111]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Ellison Medical Foundation\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Lawrence J.

Harper Business. p. 19. ISBN 978-0060008765. Larry was a religious skeptic from the beginning. The Ellisons, who were Jewish, attended synagogue regularly—\"and dragged me along\" he said. \"While I think I'm religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they're real. They're interesting stories, they're wonderful mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe that these are literally true, but I don't. . . . I see no evidence for this stuff.\" To please his parents, Ellison tried to study the Torah, to no avail. \"I couldn't make myself do it. ... I lost interest. My mind wandered in four seconds. It was an impossibility,\" he said.\n13. **^** Symonds, Matthew; Ellison, Larry (2003). *Softwar: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle*. New York: Simon & Schuster. p. 389.

He is currently the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. As a result of his immense investment success,[3][4] Buffett is one of the best-known fundamental investors in the world. As of November 2023,[5] he had a net worth of $118 billion, making him the seventh-richest person in the world.[5]\n\n\nBuffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. The son of congressman and businessman Howard Buffett, he developed an interest in business and investing during his youth. He entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon pursued a business career. He later began various business ventures and investment partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956 and his investment firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. Buffett emerged as the company's chairman and majority shareholder in 1970. In 1978, fellow investor and long-time business associate Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.[6][7]\n\n\nSince 1970, Buffett has presided as the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, one of America's foremost holding companies and world's leading corporate conglomerates. He has been referred to as the \"Oracle\" or \"Sage\" of Omaha by global media as a result of having accumulated a massive fortune derived from his business and investment success.[8][9] He is noted for his adherence to the principles of value investing, and his frugality despite his vast wealth.[10]\n\n\nBuffett has pledged to give away 99 percent[11] of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWarren Edward Buffett was born on 30 August 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, as the second of three children and the only son of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett.[13] He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker\".[14] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father.[15][16]\n\n\nBuffett showcased an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, *One Thousand Ways to Make $1000*.[17] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.[18] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They later sold the business to a war veteran for a tidy sum of $1200.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Investor Benjamin Graham was a major influential figure on the young Warren Buffett.\nBuffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated back to his schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. His father took interest in cultivating and educating the young Warren's curiosity surrounding the subject of business and investing, even at one point taking him to visit the New York Stock Exchange when he was 10.[20] At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (who also became a philanthropist).[21][22][23] At 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering *Washington Post* newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer.[24] He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings.[24] By the time he finished college, Buffett had amassed $9,800 in savings (about $125,000 today).[19][25]\n\n\nIn 1947, Buffett matriculated at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures, but enrolled due to pressure from his father.[19] Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.[26] He then transferred to the University of Nebraska where at 19, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration. After being rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance.[27]\n\n\n\n\n> The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety. That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing.[28][29][30]\n> \n> — Warren Buffett\n> \n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on Warren Buffett's time at Berkshire Hathaway: List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway\n\n### Early business career[edit]\n\n\nBuffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\n\nIn 1951,[31] Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C., on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's vice president, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,[32] and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an \"extraordinary man\" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.[33]\n\n\nBuffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course.[34] Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an \"Investment Principles\" night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair gas station as a side investment but it was unsuccessful.[35]\n\n\nIn 1952,[36] Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The next year they had their first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $136,000 today).[25] There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was adamant that stock picks should provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $1.95 million today)[25] and concurrently founded Buffett Partnership Ltd.\n\n\n\n![](image)Buffett's home in Omaha, Nebraska\nIn 1957, Buffett operated three investment partnerships. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for $31,500.[37][38] In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, Peter Andrew, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett operated seven investment partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually, eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own.\n\n\nIn 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company. He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at \"minus $20\". Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the board of directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight, the board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in.[39][40] Buffett had reaped a 50 percent return on investment in just two years.[41]\n\n\n\n### Assuming Berkshire[edit]\n\n\nIn 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing company, Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.[42] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold.\n\n\nIn a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business — Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents.[43] In 1969, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners including shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income.\n\n\nIn 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company. Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham, who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the *Buffalo Evening News* for $32.5 million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the *Buffalo Courier-Express*. Both papers lost money until the *Courier-Express* folded in 1982.\n\n\nIn 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced a $3.5 billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985, surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.[44] The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets.[45]\n\n\nIn 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers) surfaced. A rogue trader, Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.[46] Buffett became chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.[47]\n\n\nIn 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02 billion.[48] It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments and one which it still holds.[49]\n\n\n\n### As a billionaire[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998 Buffett acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties—according to the *Rational Walk* investment website, \"underwriting standards proved to be inadequate\", while a \"problematic derivatives book\" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss.[50] Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buffett meets with President Barack Obama at the White House in July 2011.\nDuring a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting.[52] On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6 billion fine.[53] In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92 million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case. Gen Re also made a commitment to implement \"corporate governance concessions\", which required Berkshire Hathaway's chief financial officer to attend General Re's audit committee meetings and mandated the appointment of an independent director.[50]\n\n\nIn 2002, Buffett entered in $11 billion worth of forward contracts to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2 billion. Buffett announced in June 2006 that he would gradually give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006—the largest contribution going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.[54]\n\n\nIn 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2007–08 financial crisis[edit]\n\n\nBuffett ran into criticism during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, part of the Great Recession starting in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals.[56] \"Buy American. I am.\" he wrote for an opinion piece published in the *New York Times* in 2008.[57] Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 \"poetic justice\".[58] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses.[59]\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway acquired 10% perpetual preferred stock of Goldman Sachs.[60] Some of Buffett's put options (European exercise at expiry only) that he wrote (sold) were running at around $6.73 billion mark-to-market losses as of late 2008.[61] The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, \"a more robust disclosure\" of factors used to value the contracts.[61] Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8 billion takeover of Rohm & Haas. He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3 billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets.[62]\n\n\nIn 2008, Buffett became the richest person in the world, garnering a total net worth estimated at $62 billion[63] by Forbes and at $58 billion[64] by Yahoo, dethroning Bill Gates, who had been number one on the Forbes list for 13 consecutive years.[65] In 2009, Gates regained the top position on the Forbes list, with Buffett shifted to second place. Both of the men's values dropped, to $40 billion and $37 billion respectively—according to Forbes, Buffett lost $25 billion over a 12-month period during 2008/2009.[66]\n\n\nIn October 2008, the media reported that Buffett had agreed to buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock.[67] The operation included special incentives: he received an option to buy three billion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (callable within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson shares from his personal portfolio.[68]\n\n\nIn addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report:\n\n\n\n\n> That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.[69]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had \"fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen\". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s—which led to years of painful stagflation—might re-emerge.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### A capitalized Berkshire[edit]\n\n\nOn August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328 billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2 billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report December 9, 2013, purchase of shares in USG Corporation as required.[72]\n\n\nIn 2009, Buffett invested $2.6 billion as a part of Swiss Re's campaign to raise equity capital.[73][74] Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%.[75] Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34 billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder, author of *Snowball*, said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry.[76] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500, Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009.[77]\n\n\nIn 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors,\n\n\n\n\n> I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010. This deal was valued at approximately $44 billion (with $10 billion of outstanding BNSF debt) and represented an increase of the previously existing stake of 22%.[79][80]\nIn June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming:\n\n\n\n\n> Very, very few people could appreciate the bubble. That's the nature of bubbles – they're mass delusions.[81]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs was given Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire's preferred stock in Goldman. Buffett had been reluctant to give up the stock, which averaged $1.4 million in dividends per day,[82][83] saying:\n\n\n\n\n> I'm going to be the Osama bin Laden of capitalism. I'm on my way to an unknown destination in Asia where I'm going to look for a cave. If the U.S. Armed forces can't find Osama bin Laden in 10 years, let Goldman Sachs try to find me.[84]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64 million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11 billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent—the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, \"I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM\".[85]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Buffett's acquisition of Media General, consisting of 63 newspapers in the south-eastern U.S., was announced.[86] The company was the second news print purchase made by Buffett in one year.[87]\n\n\nInterim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013, that the *Press of Atlantic City* would be sold to Buffett's BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in Pittsburgh, U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to \"move the needle\" at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The *Press of Atlantic City* became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' *Roanoke Times* and *The Tulsa World* in Oklahoma, U.S.[88]\n\n\nDuring a presentation to Georgetown University students in Washington, D.C., in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating \"$80 billion or $90 billion a year probably\" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society:\n\n\n\n\n> We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven't learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind.[89]\n> \n> \n\n\nAfter the difficulties of the economic crisis, Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4 billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period.[90]\n\n\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn a June 2021 interview with CNBC, Buffet said that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic inequality and bemoaned that most people are unaware that \"hundreds of thousands or millions\" of small businesses have been negatively impacted. He also stated that the markets and the economy will likely be unpredictable well into the post-pandemic recovery period, even with the Biden administration and the United States Federal Reserve having a plan in place. He said the unpredictability and the effects of COVID-19 are far from over.[91]\n\n\n\n## Investment philosophy[edit]\n\n\nWarren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators[92] as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:[93]\n\n\n\n\n> The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation.\n> \n> — Buffett, Fortune (1977)\n> \n\n\nIn his article, \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\", Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis, that beating the S&P 500 was \"pure chance\", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss, Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson (Tweedy, Browne LLC), William J. Ruane (Sequoia Fund), Charlie Munger (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).[94] In his November 1999 *Fortune* article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations:[95]\n\n\n\n\n> Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like—anything like—they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate—repeat, aggregate—would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%!\n> \n> — Buffett, Fortune (1999)\n> \n\n\n### Index funds vis-à-vis active management[edit]\n\n\nBuffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or don't have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that \"when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients\".[96] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett.[96]\n\n\n\n### Using investment banks[edit]\n\n\nBuffet has a long-standing aversion to using the services of investment banks via Berkshire Hathaway.[97] This dynamic was also reported in Barron's,[98] Insider,[99] and Seeking Alpha,[100] among others.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buffett with Gary Green in 2010\nIn 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt to capture her attention was unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life, and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity.[101]\n\n\nBuffett married Susan Buffett (born Thompson) in 1952. They had three children, Susie, Howard and Peter. The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan Buffett's death in July 2004. Their daughter, Susie, lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc., and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation.[102]\n\n\nIn 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old—she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977.[103][104] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed \"Warren, Susie and Astrid\".[105] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the *Charlie Rose Show* shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life.[106]\n\n\nBuffett disowned his son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary *The One Percent* about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her \"adored grandchildren\",[107] Buffett wrote Nicole a letter stating, \"I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin\".[108][109][110] By 2022, Buffett and his granddaughter had reconciled.[111][112]\n\n\nHis 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies.[113] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000.[114] He continued to live in the same house in the central Dundee neighborhood of Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500, a fraction of today's value. He also owned a vacation home in Laguna Beach, California,[115] which he purchased for $150,000 in 1971. He sold it for $7.5 million in 2018.[116] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7 million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet, Buffett named it \"The Indefensible\". This act was a break from his past condemnation of extravagant purchases by other CEOs and his history of using more public transportation.[117] Buffett sold the jet prior to mid-1999, and has since usually flown with Berkshire's flight services businesses.[118]\n\n\n\n> \n> Bridge is such a sensational game that I wouldn't mind being in jail if I had three cellmates who were decent players and who were willing to keep the game going twenty-four hours a day.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Buffett on bridge[119]\n\nBuffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with fellow fan Gates[120]—he is said to spend 12 hours a week playing the game.[121] In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup. Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf—held immediately before it in the same city—the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country.[122]\n\n\nHe is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football, and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini, following the 2007 season, stating, \"It was getting kind of desperate around here\".[123] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach.[124]\n\n\nBuffett was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009.[125]\n\n\nBuffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called \"Secret Millionaires Club\" with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment. The series features Buffett and Munger and teaches children healthy financial habits.[126][127]\n\n\nBuffett was raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as agnostic.[128] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile,[129] a Cadillac DTS.[130] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine.[131] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life.[132] In February 2020, Buffett revealed in a CNBC interview that he had traded in his flip phone for an iPhone 11.[133] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the *Omaha World Herald*, which his company acquired in 2011.\n\n\nBuffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname \"Woodstock of Capitalism\". Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West,[134] as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes.\n\n\nIn April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and shareholder in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China. Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement.[135][136]\n\n\nBuffett is very distantly related to the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama.[137] Buffett was a longtime friend of singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett until Jimmy's death in September 2023, and they would often refer to one another as \"Uncle Warren\" and \"Cousin Jimmy\". The two took a DNA test which revealed no relation.[138]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test.[139] He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt \"great – as if I were in my normal excellent health – and my energy level is 100 percent\".[139] On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying \"it's a great day for me\" and \"I am so glad to say that's over\".[140]\n\n\n\n## Wealth and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buffett, Kathy Ireland and Bill Gates at the 2015 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting In 2008, Buffett was ranked by *Forbes* as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion.[141] In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37 billion[142][143] with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5 billion as of September 2013.[144]\n\n\nIn 1999, Buffett was named the top money manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group, ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton.[145] In 2007, he was listed among *Time*'s 100 Most Influential People in the world.[146] In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[147] Buffett, along with Bill Gates, was named the most influential global thinker in Foreign Policy's 2010 report.[148]\n\n\nBuffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents.[149] His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, \"I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing\".[150]\n\n\nBuffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).[151] He pledged about the equivalent of 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately $30.7 billion as of June 23, 2006),[152] making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of philanthrocapitalism.[153] The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006. The pledge is conditional upon three requirements:\n\n\n\n* Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in BMGF\n* BMGF must continue to qualify as a charity\n* Each year BMGF must give away an amount equal to the prior year's Berkshire gift plus the additional 5% of net assets as required of all US foundations\n\n\nBuffett joined the Gates Foundation's board, but did not plan to be actively involved in the foundation's investments.[154][155] Buffett announced his resignation as a trustee of the Gates Foundation on June 23, 2021.[156]\n\n\nThis represented a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, to the effect that most of his fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation.[157] The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6 billion, went there when she died in 2004.[158] He also pledged $50 million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in Washington, where he began serving as an adviser in 2002.[159]\n\n\nIn 2006, he auctioned his 2001 Lincoln Town Car[160] on eBay to raise money for Girls, Inc.[161] In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation.[162] Later auctions raised $2.1 million[163][164] $1.7 million[165] and $3.5 million. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York's Smith and Wollensky steak house. The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal.[166]\n\n\nIn 2009, Ralph Nader wrote the book *Only the Super Rich Can Save Us*, a novel about \"a movement of billionaires led by Warren Buffett and featuring, among others, Ted Turner, George Soros and Barry Diller, who use their fortunes to clean up America\". On C-SPAN BookTV, Nader said Buffett invited him to breakfast after the book came out and was \"quite intrigued by the book\". He also told Nader of his plan to get \"billionaires all over the world to donate 50% of their estate to charity or good works\".[167] On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a promise they called the \"Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge\", in which they promise to donate to charity at least half of their wealth, and invite other wealthy people to follow suit.[12][168] In 2018, after making almost $3.4 billion donations,[169] Buffett was ranked 3rd in the *Forbes*' List of Billionaire 2018.[170]\n\n\nWarren Buffett continues to help fund and support his family's individual foundations which include Susan Buffett's *Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation*, Susan Alice Buffett's *Sherwood Foundation*, Howard Graham Buffett's *Howard G. Buffett Foundation*, and Peter Buffett's *NoVo Foundation*.[171][172] Warren Buffett was also supportive of his sister Doris Buffett's *Letters Foundation* and *Learning By Giving Foundation*.[173][174]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Warren Buffett made a donation of $750 million in Berkshire Hathaway shares to four charitable foundations run by his children. 1.5 million Class B shares of his conglomerate to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his first wife. He also transferred 300,000 Class B shares each to three funds managed by his children: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.[175]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Buffett has given over $50 billion to charitable causes.[176][177]\n\n\nA 2023 ProPublica report detailed conflict of interest issues with Buffet's personal stock portfolio.[178]\n\n\n\n## Political and public policy views[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buffett and President Obama in the Oval Office, July 14, 2010\nIn addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama's presidential campaign. On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago.[179] Buffett intimated that John McCain's views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a \"lobotomy\" for Buffett to change his endorsement.[180] During the second 2008 U.S. presidential debate, McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw, both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury.[181] Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor.[182] Buffett was also a financial advisor to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 2003 California gubernatorial election.[183]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2015, Buffett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president.[184] On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump to release his tax returns.[185][186] On October 10, 2016, after a reference to him in the second presidential debate, Buffett released his own tax return.[187][188] He said he had paid $1.85 million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6 million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8 billion worth of donations last year.[188] In response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit, Buffett said, \"I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump — at least he would have no legal problem.\"[188]\n\n\nBuffett has said he would judge President Donald Trump by his results on national safety, economic growth and economic participation when deciding if he would vote for him in the 2020 presidential election.[189][190]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nBuffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage.[191] Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs.[191] Buffett said in 2010 that it was not sustainable for the U.S. to devote 17% of its GDP to healthcare expenditure, noting that many other nations spent a much smaller proportion of their GDP on health expenditures, with better healthcare outcomes.[192] Buffett said, \"If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best\", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).[193]\n\n\nBuffett faults the incentives in the United States medical industry, that payers reimburse doctors for procedures (fee-for-service) leading to unnecessary care (overutilization), instead of paying for results.[194] He cited Atul Gawande's 2009 article in the *New Yorker*[195] as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas.[194] Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income.[196]\n\n\n\n### Curbing population growth[edit]\n\n\nBuffett has expressed concerns about unchecked population growth. In 2009, he met with several other billionaires to discuss healthcare, education and slowing population growth. Called \"The Good Club\" by an insider, the billionaires had given away $45 billion to philanthropic causes and included Oprah Winfrey, Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, Jr.[197] The meeting has drawn criticism from some right-wing blogs, with some believing the group to be a part of a secret sterilization society.[198]\n\n\nBuffett is a long time supporter of family planning. The Buffett Foundation has given over $1.5 billion to abortion research to include $427 million to Planned Parenthood.[199]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Buffett Rule\n\nPresident Obama announcing the \"Buffett Rule\"\nBuffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1 million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains) while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money.[200] Regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees, he said, \"How can this be fair? How can this be right? There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\"[201][202] After Donald Trump accused him of taking \"massive deductions\", Buffett countered, \"I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward.\"[203]\n\n\nBuffett favors the inheritance tax, saying that repealing it would be like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\".[204] In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy.[205] Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments.[206]\n\n\nBuffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos, calling it a tax on ignorance.[207]\n\n\n\n### Dollar and gold[edit]\n\n\nThe trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of gold as an investment, with his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said:\n\n\n\n\n> It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:\n\n\n\n\n> Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.[208]\n> \n> \n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nBuffett invested in PetroChina Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary[209] on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008.\n\n\nIn October 2008, Buffett invested $230 million for 10% of battery maker BYD Company (SEHK: 1211), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer BYD Auto. In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return.[210]\n\n\n\n### Tobacco[edit]\n\n\nDuring the RJR Nabisco, Inc. hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund:[211]\n\n\n\n\n> I'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty.\n> \n> — Buffett, quoted in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco\n> \n\n\nSpeaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are:[212]\n\n\n\n\n> fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration. I would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses. The economy of the business may be fine, but that doesn't mean it has a bright future.\n> \n> — Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting\n> \n\n\n### Coal[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Buffett's PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of his MidAmerican Energy Company, canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's Intermountain Power Project Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups.[213]\n\n\n\n### Renewable energy[edit]\n\n\nNative American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp which is a Berkshire Hathaway company. David Sokol responded on Buffett's behalf, stating that the FERC would decide the question.[214][215]\n\n\n\n### Expensing of stock options[edit]\n\n\nHe has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the Indiana House of Representatives to change the value of Pi from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.[216]\n\n\n\n\n> When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?[217]\n> \n> \n\n\n### High technology[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in high-technology companies such as Facebook and Google due to them in being complex and difficult to understand on top of their concomitant complications from them being hard in confidently estimating their future value. He also stated that initial public offering's (IPO) of new stock issues are almost always bad investments. Buffett has advised investors to look for companies that will have good value in ten years.[218]\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with CNBC in January 2018, Buffett said that the recent craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well, adding that \"when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know\". But he said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures.[219]\n\n\n\n## Film and television[edit]\n\n\nAside from countless television appearances on various news programs, Buffett has appeared in numerous films and TV programs, both documentary, and fiction. Some film and television cameos he has made include *Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps* (2010), *The Office* (U.S.), *All My Children,* and *Entourage* (2015).[220] He has been a guest 10 times on *Charlie Rose*, and was the subject of the HBO documentary feature *Becoming Warren Buffett* (2017) and the BBC production *The World's Greatest Money Maker* (2009).\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buffett playing cards with Bill Gates at Borsheims during the 2018 shareholder's weekend\n### Books about Buffett[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2008, *USA Today* reported at least 47 books were in print with Buffett's name in the title. The article quoted the CEO of Borders Books, George Jones, as saying that the only other living persons named in as many book titles were U.S. presidents, world political figures and the Dalai Lama.[221] Buffett said that his own personal favorite is a collection of his essays called *The Essays of Warren Buffett*,[222] which he described as \"a coherent rearrangement of ideas from my annual report letters\".[221]\n\n\nBooks or publications by Buffett:\n\n\n\n* *The Essays of Warren Buffett : Lessons for Corporate America*, Warren Buffett and Lawrence A.

In Sunday night's presidential debate in St. Louis, Trump claimed that Buffett took a \"massive deduction\" while defending his claimed $916 million loss in 1995 that allowed him to avoid federal income tax in at least some years. Buffett, a supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, said Monday that Trump \"has not seen my income tax returns.\" \"I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13. (Though, being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year.)

Mr Buffett, who himself did not sign the petition because he thought it did not go far enough, said that repealing the estate tax would be a \"terrible mistake\". It was like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\". Removing the tax would lead to the creation of an \"aristocracy of wealth\" instead of a meritocracy, he added.\n205. **^** Jim Snyder (November 15, 2007). \"Buffett tells Senate Finance panel 'dynastic' wealth on the rise in U.S.\" *The Hill*.

In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It later became the world's largest personal computer software company.[5][a] Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect.[8] During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[9] In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had established in 2000.[10] He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.[12]\n\n\nSince 1987, Gates has been included in the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he held the *Forbes* title of the richest person in the world every year except in 2008 and from 2010 to 2013.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.[16] In the *Forbes* 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2023, he was ranked 6th with a wealth of $115.0 billion.[17] As of November 2023,[update] Gates has an estimated net worth of US$133 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in the world according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*.[18]\n\n\nLater in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued other business and philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment, TerraPower, bgC3, and Breakthrough Energy. He has donated sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.[19] Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa.[20][21] In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWilliam Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington[3] as the only son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[23] His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[24] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president.He also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[25][26] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[27]\n\n\nAccording to Gates, when he was young, his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law.[28] During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[29][30][31] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.[26] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gates (right) with Paul Allen seated at Teletype Model 33 ASR terminals in Lakeside School, 1970\nAt age 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[33][34] where he wrote his first software program.[35] When he was in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[36] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.[37] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[38][26]\n\n\nThe four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.[26] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business.\n\n\nThe following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.[26]\n\n\nAt 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[39] In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[40][41] He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[42] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[43][44] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science courses.[45] While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated *magna cum laude*. Years later, Ballmer later succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[46][47]\n\n\nGates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[48] presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its successor is faster by only 2%.[48][49] His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[50]\n\n\nGates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[51] In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[52] Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[53] He explained his decision to leave Harvard: \"if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Microsoft[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Microsoft and Microsoft § History\n\n### BASIC[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk system whose first programming language was Microsoft's founding product, Altair BASIC\nGates read the January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[55] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[56] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[56] They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.[56] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.\n\n\nMicrosoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[57] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[56] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.[55]\n\n\nGates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. As the company grew, he transitioned into a manager role, then an executive.[58]\n\n\nDONKEY.BAS, is a computer game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed with the original IBM PC. It is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. The game was written by Gates and Neil Konzen.[59][60]\n\n\n\n### IBM partnership[edit]\n\n\nIBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC,[61] after Gates's mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, mentioned Microsoft to John Opel, IBM's then CEO.[62] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[63] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.[64] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC[65] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.[66]\n\n\nThe contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.[66] They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[67] The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. *PC Magazine* asked if Gates was \"the man behind the machine?\".[61]\n\n\nGates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.[55][68] Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.[26] They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.[69]\n\n\n\n### Windows[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use.[70] In August 1986, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[71] The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS prompt by default. Windows XP was released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO.[72] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W. Thompson on February 5, 2014.[73]\n\n\n\n### Management style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gates delivers a speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, January 2008\nDuring Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[74] but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989.[75] Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: \"Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[76]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He gradually divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[77] The process took two years to fully transfer his duties to Ozzie and Mundie, and was completed on June 27, 2008.[78]\n\n\n\n## Post Microsoft[edit]\n\n\nSince leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.\n\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014[update], most of Gates's assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[79] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become \"technology advisor\" at the firm to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11][80]\n\n\nGates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014, issue of *Rolling Stone* magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[81]\n\n\nGates has often expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that:\n\n\n\n\n> First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[82][83][84][85]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn an interview that was held at the TED conference in March 2015, with Baidu co-founder and CEO, Robin Li, Gates said he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies*.[86] During the conference, Gates warned that the world was not prepared for the next pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in late 2019 when the COVID-19 pandemic began.[87] In March 2018, Gates met at his home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman, the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[88][89] In June 2019, Gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android was his biggest mistake. He stated that it was within their skill set of being the dominant player, but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time.[90] That same year, Gates became an advisory board member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.[91]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Microsoft announced Gates would be leaving his board positions at Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft to dedicate himself to philanthropic endeavors such as climate change, global health and development, and education.[12]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates has widely been looked at by media outlets as an expert on the issue, despite him not being a public official or having any prior medical training.[92] His foundation did, however, establish the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator in 2020 to hasten the development and evaluation of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients for COVID-19,[93] and, as of February 2021, Gates expressed that he and Anthony Fauci frequently talk and collaborate on matters including vaccines and other medical innovations to fight the pandemic.[94]\n\n\n\n## Business ventures and investments *(partial list)*[edit]\n\n\nGates has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stakes in companies in various sectors and has participated in several entrepreneurial ventures beyond Microsoft, including:\n\n\n\n* AutoNation, an automotive retailer which trades on the NYSE and in which Gates has a 16% stake.[95]\n* bgC3 LLC, a think-tank and research company founded by Gates.[96]\n* Canadian National Railway (CN), a Canadian Class I freight railway. As of 2019, Gates is the single largest shareholder of the company.[97]\n* Cascade Investment LLC, a private investment and holding company incorporated in the United States, founded and controlled by Gates and headquartered in Kirkland, Washington.[98]\n\t+ Gates is the largest private owner of farmland in the United States with his landholdings owned through Cascade Investment totalling 242,000 acres across 19 states.[99][100] He is the 49th largest private owner of land in the US.[101]\n* Carbon Engineering, a for-profit venture founded by David Keith, which Gates helped fund.[102][103][104] It is also supported by Chevron Corporation and Occidental Petroleum.[105]\n\t+ SCoPEx, Keith's academic venture in \"sun-dimming\" geoengineering, which Gates provided most of the $12 million for.[106]\n* Corbis (originally named Interactive Home Systems and now known as Branded Entertainment Network), a digital image licensing and rights services company founded and chaired by Gates.[107]\n* EarthNow, a Seattle-based startup company aiming to blanket the Earth with live satellite video coverage. Gates is a large financial backer.[108]\n* Eclipse Aviation, a defunct manufacturer of very light jets. Gates was a major stake-holder early on in the project.[109]\n* Impossible Foods, a company that develops plant-based substitutes for meat products. Some of the $396 million Patrick O. Brown collected for his business came from Gates around 2014 to 2017.[110][111][112]\n* Ecolab, a global provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services to the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality markets. Combined with the shares owned by the Foundation, Gates owns 11.6% of the company. A shareholder agreement in 2012 allowed him to own up to 25% of the company, but this agreement was removed.[113]\n* ResearchGate, a social networking site for scientists. Gates participated in a $35 million round of financing along with other investors.[114]\n* TerraPower, a nuclear reactor design company co-founded and chaired by Gates, which is developing next generation traveling-wave reactor nuclear power plants in an effort to tackle climate change.[115][116][117][118][119]\n* Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a closed fund for wealthy individuals who seek ROI on a 20-year horizon (see next section), which \"is funding green start-ups and a host of other low-carbon entrepreneurial projects, including everything from advanced nuclear technology to synthetic breast milk.\" It was founded by Gates in 2015.[120]\n* Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotech startup that received $350 million in venture funding in 2019, in part from Gates's investment firm Cascade Investment.[121]\n* Luminous Computing, a company that develops neuromorphic photonic integrated circuits for AI acceleration.\n* Mologic, a British diagnostic technology company that Gates purchased, along with the Soros Economic Development Fund, \"which has developed 10-minute Covid lateral flow tests that it aims to make for as little as $1.\"[122]\n\n\n## Climate change and energy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gates and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November 2021\nGates considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical, interrelated issues. He has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper. Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices.[123] In 2011, he said: \"If you gave me the choice between picking the next 10 presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, I'd pick the energy thing.\"[124]\n\n\nIn 2015, he wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world's energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources. Global energy transitions have historically taken decades. He wrote, \"I believe we can make this transition faster, both because the pace of innovation is accelerating, and because we have never had such an urgent reason to move from one source of energy to another.\"[125] This rapid transition, according to Gates, would depend on increased government funding for basic research and financially risky private-sector investment, to enable innovation in diverse areas such as nuclear energy, grid energy storage to facilitate greater use of solar and wind energy, and solar fuels.[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)The European Commission, European Investment Bank and Gates' Breakthrough Energy Catalyst agreed at the 2021 UN Climate Change conference to work together to bring green technologies to market.\nGates spearheaded two initiatives that he announced at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. One was Mission Innovation, in which 20 national governments pledged to double their spending on research and development for carbon-free energy in over five years' time.[123] Another initiative was Breakthrough Energy, a group of investors who agreed to fund high-risk startups in clean energy technologies. Gates, who had already invested $1 billion of his own money in innovative energy startups, committed a further $1 billion to Breakthrough Energy.[126] In December 2020, he called for the U.S. federal government to create institutes for clean energy research, analogous to the National Institutes of Health.[127] Gates has also urged rich nations to shift to 100% synthetic beef industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production.[128]\n\n\nGates has been criticised for holding a large stake in Signature Aviation, a company that services emissions-intensive private jets.[129] In 2019, he began to divest from fossil fuels. He does not expect divestment itself to have much practical impact, but says that if his efforts to provide alternatives were to fail, he would not want to personally benefit from an increase in fossil fuel stock prices.[130] After he published his book *How to Avoid a Climate Disaster*, parts of the climate activist community criticized Gate's approach as technological solutionism.[131] In 2022, educational streamer Wondrium produced the series \"Solving for Zero: The Search for Climate Innovation\" inspired by the book.[132]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Gates's company TerraPower and Warren Buffett's PacifiCorp announced the first sodium nuclear reactor in Wyoming. Wyoming Governor Mike Gordon hailed the project as a step toward carbon-negative nuclear power. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso also said that it could boost the state's once-active uranium mining industry.[133]\n\n\nGates spent many efforts to make pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 because of his importance to climate. He tried to convince Joe Manchin to support a climate bill from the year 2019 and especially in the months before the adoption of the bill. The bill should cut the global greenhouse gas emissions in a level similar to \"eliminating the annual planet-warming pollution of France and Germany combined\" and may help to limit the warming of the planet to 1.5 degrees – the target of the Paris Agreement.[134] He thanked both Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer for their efforts in a guest essay in *The New York Times*, where he said \"Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history\" given its potential to spur development of new technologies.[135] Gates gave further insights on climate change in his commencement address at Northern Arizona University on May 6, 2023, where he was bestowed an honorary doctorate.[136]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Regulation of the software industry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bill Gates § Antitrust litigation, and United States v. Microsoft Corp.\n\nIn 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate.[137] During the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) investigation of Microsoft in the 1990s, Gates was reportedly upset at Commissioner Dennis Yao for \"float[ing] a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft's growing monopoly power\". According to one source:\n\n\n\n\n> Gates was vexed. \"He started by calling Yao's ideas socialistic,\" recalls a source familiar with the July 15 meeting, \"and as he got angrier and angrier and louder and louder, he got into calling them Communistic.\"[138]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Donald Trump Facebook ban[edit]\n\n\nOn February 18, 2021, after Facebook and Twitter had banned Donald Trump from their platforms as a result of the 2020 United States presidential election which led to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Gates said a permanent ban of Trump \"would be a shame\" and would be an \"extreme measure\". He warned that it would cause \"polarization\" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: \"I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good.\"[137]\n\n\n\n### Patents for COVID-19 vaccines[edit]\n\n\nMain article: TRIPS Agreement waiver\n\nIn April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for COVID-19 vaccines. The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines. Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated, \"Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections. It's disgusting.\"[139]\n\n\nGates is opposed to the TRIPS waiver.[140][141][142] Bloomberg News reported him as saying he argued that Oxford University should not give away the rights to its COVID-19 information, as it had announced, but instead sell it to a single industry partner, as it did.[143] His views on the value of legal monopolies in medicine have been linked to his views on legal monopolies in software.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Cryptocurrencies[edit]\n\n\nGates is critical of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. According to Gates, cryptocurrencies provide no \"valuable output\", contribute nothing to society, and pose a danger especially for smaller investors who could not survive the potentially high losses. Gates also does not own any cryptocurrencies himself.[144]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n### Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\n![](image)Gates with Bono, Queen Rania of Jordan, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, President Umaru Yar'Adua of Nigeria and others during the Annual Meeting 2008 of the World Economic Forum\nGates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation\". In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's largest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[145][146] The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[147][148] Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to the Carnegie Mellon University for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009.[149][150]\n\n\nGates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. He and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[151]\n\n\nThe foundation is organized into five program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division. Among others, it supports a wide range of public health projects, granting aid to fight transmissible diseases such AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate polio. It grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports scholarships at universities. The foundation established a water, sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services in poor countries.[152] Its agriculture division supports the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin A deficiency.[153] The foundation aims to provide women and girls in the developing world with information and support regarding contraception and, ultimately, universal access to consensual family planning.[154] In 2007, the *Los Angeles Times* criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries.[155] Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility,[156] it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gates in a fireside chat moderated by Shereen Bhan virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2020\nGates delivered his thoughts in a fireside chat moderated by journalist and news anchor Shereen Bhan virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival on December 8, 2020, on the topic, \"Building Infrastructure for Resilience: What the COVID-19 Response Can Teach Us About How to Scale Financial Inclusion\".[158]\n\n\n\n\n> Governments are there to think ahead to bad things that might happen. In the case of (the COVID-19) pandemic, not enough was done. We can't forget that another pandemic will come and we'll need to invest in being ready in that, ... while not forgetting that we were not prepared and we're going to have to invest – just like having a fire department – some money in an intelligent way and actually simulate what might happen and make sure that we're ready for it.[158]\n> \n> \n\n\nGates favors the normalization of COVID-19 masks. In a November 2020 interview, he said: \"What are these, like, nudists? I mean, you know, we ask you to wear pants, and no American says, or very few Americans say, that that's, like, some terrible thing.\"[159]\n\n\n\n### Personal donations[edit]\n\n\nMelinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, *The Power of Half*.[160] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and investor Warren Buffett each signed a commitment they called the \"Giving Pledge\", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity.[161][162][163]\n\n\nGates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[164]\n\n\nThe Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the school's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[165] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[166]\n\n\nSince 2005, Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[167] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014 – it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni Processor.[168][169] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on *The Tonight Show* and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[170]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Gates said he would give $50 million to the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital fund that seeks treatment for Alzheimer's disease. He also pledged an additional $50 million to start-up ventures working in Alzheimer's research.[171] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they are expected to give away about 99.96% of their wealth.[172] On August 25, 2018, Gates distributed $600,000 through his foundation via UNICEF which is helping flood affected victims in Kerala, India.[173]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Gates offered free ebooks, to all new graduates of U.S. colleges and universities,[174] and in 2021, offered free ebooks, to all college and university students around the world.[175][176] The Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation partially funds OpenStax, which creates and provides free digital textbooks.[177]\n\n\nIn July 2022 he reiterated the commitment he had made by starting The Giving Pledge campaign by announcing on his Twitter channel he planned to give 'virtually all' his wealth to charity and eventually 'move off of the list of the world's richest people.'[178]\n\n\n\n### Charity sports events[edit]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2017, Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in playing in the Match for Africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of the Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[179] Federer and Gates played against John Isner, the top-ranked American player for much of this decade, and Mike McCready, the lead guitarist for Pearl Jam. The pair won the match 6 games to 4. Overall, they raised $2 million for children in Africa.[180] The following year, Gates and Federer returned to play in the Match for Africa 5 on March 5, 2018, at San Jose's SAP Center. Their opponents were Jack Sock, one of the top American players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and Savannah Guthrie, a co-anchor for NBC's *Today* show. Gates and Federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6–3 and the event raised over $2.5 million.[181]\n\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\nGates has so far authored four books:\n\n\n\n* *The Road Ahead*, co-authored with Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold and journalist Peter Rinearson, was published in November 1995. It summarized the implications of the personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global information superhighway.\n* *Business @ the Speed of Thought*, co-authored with Collins Hemingway, was published in 1999, and discusses how business and technology are integrated, and shows how digital infrastructures and information networks can help to get an edge on the competition.\n* *How to Avoid a Climate Disaster*, published in February 2021, presents what Gates learned in over a decade of studying climate change and investing in innovations to address climate problems.[182]\n* *How to Prevent the Next Pandemic*, published in April 2022, details the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes a \"Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization\" (GERM) team with annual funding of $1 billion,[183] under the auspices of the WHO.[184]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGates is an avid reader,[185] and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from *The Great Gatsby*.[186] He also enjoys bridge, tennis and golf.[187][188] His days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similarly to the U.S. president's schedule.[189] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach (economy class) in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[190]\n\n\nGates purchased the Codex Leicester, a collection of scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci, for US$30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[191] In 1998, he reportedly paid $30 million for the original 1885 maritime painting *Lost on the Grand Banks*, at the time a record price for an American painting.[192] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind.[193] On May 10, 2022, Gates said that he tested positive for COVID-19 and was experiencing mild symptoms.[194] Gates has received three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[194]\n\n\n\n### Marriage and divorce[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gates and Melinda, 2009\nGates married Melinda French on the Hawaiian Island of Lanai on January 1, 1994.[195] They met in 1987 after Melinda began working at Microsoft.[196] At the time of their marriage, Gates was given permission by Melinda to spend limited time with his ex-girlfriend, businesswoman Ann Winblad.[197] Bill and Melinda have three children: Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe.[198] The family's residence is an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. In 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million.[199] The 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room.[200] On May 3, 2021, the Gateses announced they had decided to divorce after 27 years of marriage and 34 years as a couple.[201] They said they would keep working together on charitable efforts.[201][202] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Melinda had been meeting with divorce attorneys since 2019, citing interviews that suggested Bill's ties with Jeffrey Epstein was at least one of her concerns.[203] The divorce was finalized on August 2, 2021.[204]\n\n\n\n### Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gates meets with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, February 2017\nGates's public image has changed over the years. At first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless \"robber baron\", a \"nerd-turned-tycoon\".[205] Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education. His image morphed from \"tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior\" to a \"huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist\", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change.[205] Still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing. Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[206] This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from \"a lovable nerd who was out to save the world\" to \"a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health.\"[207]\n\n\nInvestigative journalist Tim Schwab has accused Gates of using his contributions to the media to shape their coverage of him in order to protect his public image.[92][208] In September 2022, *Politico* published an exposé critical of NGO leadership at the helm of the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic response, written in cooperation with the German newspaper *Welt.* Criticisms included the interconnectivity of the non-profits with Gates, as well as his personal lack of formal credentials in medicine.[209]\n\n\nGates and the projects of his foundation have been the subject of many conspiracy theories that proliferate on Facebook and elsewhere. He has been implausibly accused of attempting to depopulate the world, distributing harmful or unethical vaccines, and implanting people with privacy-violating microchips. These largely unfounded theories reached a new level of influence during the COVID-19 pandemic when, according to *New York Times* journalist Rory Smith, the uncertainties of pandemic life drove people to seek explanations from the Internet.[210][211] When asked about the theories, Gates has remarked that some people are tempted by the \"simple explanation\" that an evil person rather than biological factors are to blame, and that he does not know for what purpose anyone believes he would want to track them with microchips.[212][213]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Rolling Stone*, Gates said in regard to his faith: \"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\"[214] In the same 2014 interview he also said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[214]\n\n\n\n### Wealth[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed US$100 billion making him the first person ever to achieve the feat.[215][190] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings declined due to the fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he had made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates remarked that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention that it brought.[216] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person after Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[217][218] Slim retook the position again in June 2014[219][220] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to US$82 billion.[221] In October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.[16] On November 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in Microsoft shares, surpassing Bezos.[222] Gates told the BBC, \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so ... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[223] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[224]\n\n\nBy 2017, Gates had held the top spot on the list of *The World's Billionaires* in 18 out of the previous 23 years.[225] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of US$616,667 and US$350,000 bonus totalling US$966,667.[226] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a board member of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[227]\n\n\nIn 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in *Forbes* magazine's first ever America's richest issue and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.25 billion.[14] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the *Forbes* The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest person from 1995 to 1996,[228] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and held the spot until 2018 before being overtaken by Jeff Bezos.[15] Gates was number one on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans from 1993 through to 2007, 2009, and 2014 through 2017.[229][230]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Antitrust litigation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: United States Microsoft antitrust case and European Union Microsoft competition case\n\n![](image)Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998\nDuring his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 *United States v. Microsoft* case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head.[231] *BusinessWeek* reported:\n\n\n\n\n> Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying \"I don't recall\" so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[232]\n> \n> \n\n\nGates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. \"Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty ... rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[233] Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization, tying and blocking competition, each in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[233]\n\n\n\n### Treatment of colleagues and employees[edit]\n\n\nGates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[234] An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor\".[235]\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, while business partner Paul Allen was undergoing treatments for cancer, Gates — according to Allen — conspired to reduce the latter's share in Microsoft by issuing himself stock options.[236][237][238] In his autobiography, Allen would later recall that Gates was \"scheming to rip me off. It was mercenary opportunism plain and simple\".[236] Gates says he remembers the episode differently.[237] Allen would also recall that Gates was prone to shouting episodes.[238]\n\n\nGates has often been accused of bullying Microsoft employees.[239] He met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative, berating them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[240][241] Gates saw competition in personal terms; when Borland's Turbo Pascal performed better than Microsoft's own tools, he yelled at programming director Greg Whitten \"for half an hour\" because, Gates believed, Borland's Philippe Kahn had surpassed Gates.[242] Gates interrupted presentations with such comments as \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard\"[243] and \"why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[244] The target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until Gates was fully convinced.[243] Not all harsh language was criticism; a manager recalled that \"You're full of shit. That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard\" meant that Gates was amazed. \"In the lore of Microsoft, if Bill says that to you, you're made\".[245] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend\".[246][75][247]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein[edit]\n\n\nA 2019 *New York Times* article reported that Gates's relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a child for prostitution, and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with his wife in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort.[248] Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: \"His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me\".[206]\n\n\nThe depth of the friendship between Gates and Epstein is unclear though Gates generally commented that \"I met him. I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him\".[249] However, Gates visited Epstein \"many times, despite [Epstein's] past\".[248] It was reported that Epstein and Gates \"discussed the Gates Foundation and philanthropy\".[248] However, in an interview in 2019 Gates completely denied any connection between Epstein and the Gates Foundation or his philanthropy generally.[249] In August 2021, Gates said the reason he had meetings with Epstein was because Gates hoped Epstein could provide money for philanthropic work, though nothing came of the idea. Gates added, \"It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.\"[239] Gates came under further scrutiny after it was revealed that he had travelled on Epstein's private jet, though further claims about Gates travelling to Little St James proved unsubstantiated.[250]\n\n\nIt has also been reported that Epstein and Gates met with Nobel Committee chair Thorbjørn Jagland at his residence in Strasbourg, France in March 2013 to discuss the Nobel Prize.[251] Also in attendance were representatives of the International Peace Institute which has received millions in grants from the Gates Foundation, including a $2.5 million \"community engagement\" grant in October 2013.[252] In 2023, it was reported that Epstein threatened to expose an alleged affair Gates had with a Russian bridge player.[253]\n\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\nBill and Melinda Gates being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then President Barack Obama in 2016\n* *Time* magazine named Gates as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century in 1999, as well as one of the 100 most influential people in 2004, 2005, and 2006 respectively.[254]\n* *Time* also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts.[255] In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of \"Heroes of our time\" published by *New Statesman*.[256]\n* Gates was listed in the London *Sunday Times* power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by *Chief Executive Officers* magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the \"Top 50 Cyber Elite\" by *Time* in 1998, ranked number two in the *Upside* Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in *The Guardian* as one of the \"Top 100 influential people in media\" in 2001.[257]\n* Gates was elected a Member of the US National Academy of Engineering in 1996 \"for contributions to the founding and development of personal computing\".[258]\n* He was named a Honorary Member of the American Library Association in 1998.[259]\n* He was elected a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 2017.[260]\n* According to *Forbes*, Gates was ranked as the fourth most powerful person in the world in 2012,[261] up from fifth in 2011.[262]\n* In 1994, he was honored as the 20th Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS). In 1999, Gates received New York Institute of Technology's President's Medal.[263]\n* Gates has received honorary doctorates from Nyenrode Business Universiteit (1996),[264] KTH Royal Institute of Technology (2002),[265] Waseda University (2005),[266] Tsinghua University (2007),[267] Harvard University (2007),[268] the Karolinska Institute (2007),[269] the University of Cambridge (2009),[270] and Northern Arizona University (2023).[271][272]\n* He was also made an honorary trustee of Peking University in 2007.[273]\n* Gates was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[274]\n* In January 2006, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry by the then President of Portugal Jorge Sampaio.\n* In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program \"**Un país de lectores**\".[275]\n* Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[276]\n* Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[277]\n* In 2002, Bill and Melinda Gates received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged.[278]\n* He was given the 2006 James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award from the Tech Awards.[279]\n* In 2015, Gates and his wife Melinda received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award for their social work in the country.[280][281]\n* In 2016, Barack Obama honored Bill and Melinda Gates with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their philanthropic efforts.[282]\n* In 2017, François Hollande awarded Bill and Melinda Gates with France's highest national order, as Commanders in the Legion of Honour, for their charity efforts.[283]\n* In 2019 Gates was awarded the Professor Hawking Fellowship of the Cambridge Union in the University of Cambridge.[284]\n* Entomologists named Bill Gates' flower fly, **Eristalis gatesi**, in his honor in 1997.[285]\n* In 2020, Gates received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun for his contributions to Japan and the world in regards to worldwide technological transformation and advancement of global health.[286]\n* In 2021, Gates was nominated at the 11th annual Streamy Awards for the crossover for his personal YouTube channel.[287]\n* In 2022, Gates received the Hilal-e-Pakistan, the second-highest civilian award in Pakistan for his social work in the country.\n\n\n## Depiction in media[edit]\n\n\n### Documentary films about Gates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) The Machine That Changed The World; Interview with Bill Gates, 1990 (raw video), 44:03, Open Vault WGBH[288] |\n\n\n* *The Machine That Changed the World* (1990)\n* *Triumph of the Nerds* (1996)\n* *Nerds 2.0.1* (1998)\n* *Waiting for \"Superman\"* (2010)[289]\n* *The Virtual Revolution* (2010)\n* *Inside Bill's Brain: Decoding Bill Gates* (2019)\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n* 1999: *Pirates of Silicon Valley*, a film that chronicles the rise of Apple and Microsoft from the early 1970s to 1997.

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company and xAI; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$219 billion as of November 2023[update], according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*, and $241 billion according to *Forbes*, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.[5][6]\n\n\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.\n\n\nIn October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.[7]\n\n\nMusk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[8][9][10] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, transphobia[11][12][13] and antisemitic conspiracy theories.[8][14][15][16] His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including laying off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the website,[17][18] and changes to Twitter Blue verification.[19][20] In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and family[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Musk family\n\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[21][22] He has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[23][24] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[25][26][27] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika, as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[28][29][30][31] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[27][32]\n\n\nMusk's family was wealthy during his youth.[31] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[21] His maternal grandfather and namesake, Joshua Elon Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[33][34][35][36] Haldeman was a member of the Social Credit Party of Canada, possessed antisemitic beliefs, and supported the Technocracy movement.[37] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[23][28] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[38] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[33][39]\n\n\nMusk was often bullied. In one incident, after calling a boy whose father had committed suicide \"stupid\", Musk was severely beaten and thrown down concrete steps.[40] He was also an enthusiast reader of books, attributing his success in part to having read *Benjamin Franklin: An American Life*, *Lord of the Flies*, the *Foundation* series, and *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.[41][42] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[43] At age twelve, Musk sold his BASIC-based game *Blastar* to *PC and Office Technology* magazine for approximately $500.[44][45]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![An ornate school building](image)Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.[46] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[47] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[48][49] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[50] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[51]\n\n\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[52] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.[53] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[54][55] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School.[56][57][58][59] Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997.[60] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[61]\n\n\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[62][63] In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University.[64][65] However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[66][48]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n### Zip2[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Zip2\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at USC on YouTube |\n\n\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link, later renamed to Zip2.[67][68] The company was financed mainly through a financing round of US$200,000, of which 10% was contributed by his father Errol Musk.[69] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[70] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[71] with Musk coding the website every night.[71] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with *The New York Times* and the *Chicago Tribune*.[61] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[72] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[73] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[74][75] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[76]\n\n\n\n### X.com and PayPal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia\n\nLater in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[77] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[78] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[79]\n\n\nIn 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[71][79][80] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[81] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[82] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[83][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[85][86]\n\n\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[87][88] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[89][90] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[91]\n\n\n\n### SpaceX[edit]\n\n\nMain article: SpaceX\n\n![Musk shakes hands with NASA Administrator Charles Bolden before a SpaceX Dragon capsule](image)Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission\nIn early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[92] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[93] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[93] With $100 million of his own money,[94] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[95][96]\n\n\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[97] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[98]) Mike Griffin later that year.[99][100] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[97] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[101] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[102] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014\nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.[104] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[105] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[106][107] Since 2019,[108] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[109] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[110]\n\n\n\n#### Starlink[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Starlink\n\nSee also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War\n\n![](image)50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019\nIn 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[111] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[112] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[113][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[116][117][118]\n\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[119] However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[120][121] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[122] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[123][124][125]\n\n\n\n### Tesla[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla, Inc.\n\n![Musks stands, arms crossed and grinning, before a Tesla Model S](image)Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011\nTesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[126] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[127] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design,but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[128]\n\n\nFollowing a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[129][*page needed*][130] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[131] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[132][133] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[134] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[135]\n\n\n\n![Musk speaking with a microphone, a projected image of a Tesla is behind him](image)Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting\nTesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[136] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[137] A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[138] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[139] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[140][141] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[142] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[143] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[144]\n\n\nSince its initial public offering in 2010,[145] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[146][147] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[148][149] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[150] In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[151] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[151] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[152] In February 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[153] In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[154] On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[155]\n\n\n\n#### SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[156][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[156][160][161] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[162] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[163][164] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.[165] In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[166]\n\n\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[167] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[168] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[169] In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[170][171] FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[172]\n\n\n\n#### SolarCity and Tesla Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy\n\n![Two green vans sporting the SolarCity logo](image)SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[173] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[174] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[175] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[176][177]\n\n\nTesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[178] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[179][180] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[181][182] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[183]\n\n\n\n### Neuralink[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Neuralink\n\n![Musk standing next to bulky medical equipment on a stage](image)Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[184][185] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[185][186] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[187]\n\n\nIn 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[184] He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research,[188] although Musk's being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.[189] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[190][191][192] with *MIT Technology Review* describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[190] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[187] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[193]\n\n\nNeuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[194] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[195]\n\n\nIn September 2023, the company was approved to intitiate human trials; the company will conduct a six-year study.[196]\n\n\n\n### The Boring Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Boring Company\n\n![Musk speaks to a crowd of journalists. Behind him is a lighted tunnel.](image)Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California\nIn 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[197][198] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[199] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[200]\n\n\nTwo tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[201][202] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[203] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[204] In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[205]\n\n\n\n### Twitter / X[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk\n\n> \n> \n> \n> |  |  |  |\n> | --- | --- | --- |\n> | ![](image)\n>  | Elon Musk | ![Twitter logo, a stylized blue bird](image) |\n> | @elonmusk |\n> \n> \n> I made an offer  \n> https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar...\n> \n> April 14, 2022[206]\n> \n>\n\nMusk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[207] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[208][209] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[210] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[211] making him the largest shareholder.[212][e] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO.[214] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[215][216] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[212][217] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[218] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[219] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[220][221]\n\n\nTesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[222][223] He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[224] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[225] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[226] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[227] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[228] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[229] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[230]\n\n\nImmediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[230][231] Musk became the CEO instead.[232] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[233][234][19] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[235][236] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like the *Bee*,[237][238] and in December, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[239]\n\n\nComments on these internal documents by journalists, Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted at Twitter as the Twitter Files. The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023 at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony. [240]\n\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[20] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[17][12]\n\n\nIn late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that majority of user wanted him to do so.[241][242] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[243]\n\n\n\n### Leadership style[edit]\n\n\n![Musk is pictrued delivering a speech to SpaceX employees while standing at a podium besides a capsule in 2012](image)Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012\nMusk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[244] *The New York Times* has characterized his approach as absolutist.[245] Musk does not make formal business plans;[245] instead, he says he prefers to approach engineering problems[**non sequitur**] with an \"iterative design methodology\" and \"tolerance for failures\".[246] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[247] vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.[244]\n\n\nMusk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[248][249][250] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.[251] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[252][253] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[253] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[254] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[255]\n\n\nMusk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[244] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[250][256] The 2021 book *Power Play* contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[257] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[258]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n### Musk Foundation[edit]\n\n\nMusk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[259][260] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[261]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's non-profit Big Green.[262] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[263] which was a non-profit at the time.[264]\n\n\nIn 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[265] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[266]\n\n\n*Vox* said \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[263] The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.[267] In 2020, *Forbes* gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[262] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[268] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to non-profits that year.[269]\n\n\n\n### Hyperloop[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition\n\n![A long white tube about 10 feet in diameter](image)A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX\nIn August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain—a vacuum tube train—and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[270] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the hyperloop.[271] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[272] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[273] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[274]\n\n\nIn 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[275] In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[276] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from the Boring Company website in 2021.[277] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is cited to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[278]\n\n\nBiographer Ashlee Vance has noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[279]\n\n\n\n### OpenAI and xAI[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: OpenAI and xAI (company)\n\nIn December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[280] A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[38] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[281] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[282]\n\n\nIn 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[283] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text),[284] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[285]\n\n\nOn July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company has reportedly hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[286] The company, which is incorporated in Nevada, purchased 10,000 graphics processing units. Musk was reportedly obtaining funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[287]\n\n\n\n### Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tham Luang cave rescue\n\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[288] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[289] Engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[290][291] By this time, however, eight of the 12 children, had already been rescued, the rescuers employing full face masks, oxygen, and anesthesia; consequently, Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.[288] In March 2019, Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[292]\n\n\nSoon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[293] He deleted the tweets,[293] and apologized,[294] and he deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[295] In an email to *BuzzFeed News*, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[296][297]\n\n\nIn September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in the District Court for the Central District of California.[298][299] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[46] The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[300] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[301][302]\n\n\n\n### 2018 cannabis incident[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Musk was interviewed on an episode of *The Joe Rogan Experience* podcast, during which he sampled a cigar laced with cannabis.[303] In 2022, Musk said that he and other Space-X employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[304] In a 2019 *60 Minutes* interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[305]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Musk, through Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[306] The track, which refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event, was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[307] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[308] While *Guardian* critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[309] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[308]\n\n\n\n### Private jet[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions\n\nIn 2003, Musk said his favorite plane he owned was an L-39 Albatros.[310] He uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[311][312] His heavy use of the jet—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[311][313]\n\n\nHis flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. The Twitter version of the account was blocked in December 2022, after Musk claimed that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed.[314][315][316] This led to Musk banning the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, *CNN*, and *The Intercept.[317]* Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[318] The police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[319] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[320]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n### Net worth[edit]\n\n\n![A graph of Musk's net worth from 2013 to 2023, displaying a roughly exponential trend](image)Musk's net worth from 2013 to 2023 as estimated by *Forbes* magazine\nMusk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[321] He was first listed on the *Forbes Billionaires List* in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[322]\n\n\nAt the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[323] By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[324] During this period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in *Bloomberg Billionaires Index's* history at the time.[325] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[326]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[327] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[328] On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world.[329] In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.[330]\n\n\nOn December 30, 2022, it was reported that Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth due to declining stock values in Tesla, becoming the first person in history to lose such a large sum of money.[331][332] In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the \"largest loss of personal fortune in history\" with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.[333]\n\n\nMusk's personal wealth is managed by his family office called Excession LLC, formed in 2016 and run by Jared Birchall.[334][260]\n\n\n\n### Sources of wealth[edit]\n\n\nAround 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,[326] a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,[f] after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.[335] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[324] The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values.[336] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.[337] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[337][336]\n\n\nMusk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.[338] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[339] He claimed his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.[338]\n\n\nMusk has repeatedly described himself as \"cash poor\",[340][341] and has \"professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth\".[340] In May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions.[341] Musk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for humanity's outward expansion to space.[342]\n\n\n\n## Personal views and Twitter (later X) usage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Views of Elon Musk\n\nSince joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[343] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[344] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[345] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[346][347] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[348] *The New York Times* describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[349] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[350] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[351][352]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of antisemitism[edit]\n\n\nThe Israel government and several media outlets accused Musk of antisemitism due to him spreading George Soros conspiracy theories,[353] although some Israeli officials defended Musk.[354] A tweet of his in November 2023 supported white nationalist ideology[355] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[356][357] The following day, Musk made a tweet supporting white pride.[358][359] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[360] Musk wrote that he doesn’t believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League.[361]\n\n\n\n### Existential threats[edit]\n\n\n![Musk standing at a wooden podium talking at the 2006 Mars Society Conference](image)Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference\nMusk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[362] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[363][364] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[365][366] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[367] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[368][369] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[370]\n\n\nMusk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[371] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[372] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[373][374] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[375]\n\n\nMusk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[376] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[377][378] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[379] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[380][381] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[382] Speaking at *The Wall Street Journal*'s CEO Council session in 2021, Musk stated that a declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[383]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n![Musk converses with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein beside a red Tesla](image)\n![Musk converses with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, the Second Lady, and other officials](image)\nMusk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory (2010), and with Vice President Mike Pence at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch (2020)\n\nWhile often described as libertarian, Musk has called himself \"politically moderate\" and was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. *The New York Times* wrote that Musk \"expresses views that don't fit neatly into [the American] binary, left-right political framework\".[384] Historically, Musk has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[385] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[384] Beginning in the late 2010s, Musk's political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[386]\n\n\nMusk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[387] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[388] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[389] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[390] In 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[391][392] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections, which was an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy.[393][394] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and Twitter hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[395][396][397] In August 2023, Musk hosted Vivek Ramaswamy on Twitter Spaces, and shared his support.[398] As of May 2023, Musk was declining to endorse any specific candidate.[396]\n\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, June 20, 2023\nMusk opposes a \"billionaire's tax\",[399] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[400][401] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[402] and Elizabeth Warren.[403] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[404][405] Musk also promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[406] In May 2022, Musk traveled to Brazil to discuss projects to protect the Amazon rainforest with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.[407][408]\n\n\nMusk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[409] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[410]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for *China Cyberspace*, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[411][412] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[413][414][415] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[416][417] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[418][419][420] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[421][422][423] In October 2023, Musk said that \"We are sleepwalking our way into World War III with one foolish decision after the other.\"[424]\n\n\nIn a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody’s child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[425] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that users who use terms like \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that imply genocide of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[426]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\n![Musk wearing a face mask](image)Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic\nMusk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[427][428] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[429]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[430][431] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[427] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[428] *Politico* labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[432] Musk also claimed falsely that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[433][434]\n\n\nMusk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[427][435][436] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[437][438] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[438] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[439][440]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[441] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[442] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[441] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[443][444]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[445][446] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[447] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen,\" which then trended on Twitter.[447][448] In December 2021, Musk revealed that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[449]\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\nMusk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to discourage poor behavior.[450][451] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[452] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[453] In addition, Tesla made large sums from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits offered in California and at the United States federal level, which facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as the tax credits given by governments enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive, in comparison with existing lower-priced internal combustion engine vehicles.[454] Notably, Tesla generates some of its revenue from its sales of carbon credits granted to the company, by both the European Union Emissions Trading System and the Chinese national carbon trading scheme.[455][456][457][458]\n\n\nMusk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[459][460] *Wired* magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[461] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[462][463]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[464] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[465]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nMusk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[466] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[467] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[468] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[469] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[470][471]\n\n\nDespite the Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[472][473][474] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[473][475][474]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFrom the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[476] He then relocated to Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[476][477] While hosting *Saturday Night Live* in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[478][479] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for the proposed fight between himself and Mark Zuckerberg.[480] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[481][482]\n\n\n\n### Relationships and children[edit]\n\n\nMusk has 10 surviving children.[483] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[484] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[485] After his death, the couple used IVF to continue their family;[486] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[486] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody.[487][488] In 2022, one of the twins (his eldest) officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity as a trans woman and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[489] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the *Financial Times* characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists.\"[490]\n\n\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[491] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[492][493] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[494] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[494] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[495] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[496] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[497]\n\n\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.[498] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[499][500] According to Musk and Grimes, his name was \"X Æ A-12\" (/ɛks æʃ eɪ ˈtwɛlv/); however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[501][502] and was then changed to \"X Æ A-Xii\". This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.[503] The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with \"X\" as a first name, \"AE A-XII\" as a middle name, and \"Musk\" as surname.[504] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed \"Y\"), born via surrogacy.[2] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with *Time* in December 2021, he said he was single.[505][506] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[2] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[507] In September 2023 it was revealed that the pair had a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus \"Tau\" Musk.[4]\n\n\nIn July 2022, *Insider* published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[508] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[509] Also in July 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[510] Musk denied the report.[511]\n\n\nMusk has also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as “an occasional girlfriend.”[512]\n\n\n\n### Legal matters[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\n\nIn May 2022, *Business Insider* cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[513] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from *Business Insider* of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[514][515] After the release of the *Business Insider* article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[516] decreasing Musk's net worth by $10 billion.[517] *Barron's* wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[518]\n\n\nIn April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[519] In May, a judge granted the U.S. Virgin Islands' request to serve Musk electronically through Tesla after the U.S. territory had difficulty locating him.[519] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[519]\n\n\nMusk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[520][521]\n\n\nBen Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[522][523][524] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[522] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[522][523]\n\n\nIn October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he was refusing to testify in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[525][526][527] According to the lawsuit, Musk testified twice in 2022 but refused to testify a third time in 2023, claiming the SEC was harassing him.[525][527]\n\n\n\n## Public perception[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk\n\n![](image)Musk (right) and President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010\nThough his ventures were influential within their own industries in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[528]\n\n\nMusk was partly inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film *Iron Man* (2008).[529] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, *Iron Man 2*.[530] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as *Machete Kills* (2013),[531] *Why Him?* (2016),[532] and *Men in Black: International* (2019).[533] Television series in which he has appeared include *The Simpsons* (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[534] *The Big Bang Theory* (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[535] *South Park* (\"Members Only\", 2016),[536][537] *Young Sheldon* (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[538] *Rick and Morty* (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[539][540] and *Saturday Night Live* (2021).[541] He contributed interviews to the documentaries *Racing Extinction* (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed *Lo and Behold* (2016).[542][543]\n\n\nMusk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[544] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[545] and IEEE Honorary Membership.[546] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[547] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[548] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[549] *Time* has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions in 2010,[550] 2013,[551] 2018,[552] and 2021.[553] Musk was selected as *Time*'s \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. *Time* editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[554][555] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[556]\n\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** One child is deceased.[3]\n2. **^** Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[84][85]\n3. **^** SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[114][115]\n4. **^** Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[157] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[158][159]\n5. **^** He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[213]\n6. **^** According to the Wall Street Journal, he was worth $140 billion, with $52 billion of that attributable to his ownership of Tesla stock.\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Elon Musk Reflects on \"Brutal\" Relationship With Amber Heard in New Biography\". *E!
