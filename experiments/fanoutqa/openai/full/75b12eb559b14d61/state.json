He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.\n\n\nArmstrong was born and raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio. He entered Purdue University, studying aeronautical engineering, with the U.S. Navy paying his tuition under the Holloway Plan. He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Essex*. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.\n\n\nArmstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash.\n\n\nOn July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module *Eagle* spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Apollo Command Module *Columbia*. When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. President Jimmy Carter presented him with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979, and with his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.\n\n\nAfter he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle *Challenger* disaster. In 2012, Armstrong died due to complications resulting from coronary bypass surgery, at the age of 82.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nArmstrong was born near Wapakoneta, Ohio,[5] on August 5, 1930, the son of Viola Louise (n\u00e9e Engel) and Stephen Koenig Armstrong. He was of German, English, Scots-Irish, and Scottish descent.[6][7] He is a descendant of Clan Armstrong.[8][9] He had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father was an auditor for the Ohio state government,[10] and the family moved around the state repeatedly, living in 16 towns over the next 14 years.[11] Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having started at the age of two when his father took him to the Cleveland Air Races. When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio, when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor (also known as the \"Tin Goose\").[12][13]\n\n\nThe family's last move was in 1944 and took them back to Wapakoneta, where Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the Wapakoneta airfield.[5] He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed in August, all before he had a driver's license.[14] He was an active Boy Scout and earned the rank of Eagle Scout.[15] As an adult, he was recognized by the Scouts with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award.[16][17] While flying toward the Moon on July 18, 1969, he sent his regards to attendees at the National Scout jamboree in Idaho.[18] Among the few personal items that he carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.[19]\n\n\nAt age 17, in 1947, Armstrong began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana; he was the second person in his family to attend college. Armstrong was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[20] but he resolved to go to Purdue after watching a football game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Ohio Stadium in 1945 in which quarterback Bob DeMoss led the Boilermakers to a sound victory over the highly regarded Buckeyes.[21] An uncle who attended MIT had also advised him that he could receive a good education without going all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts. His college tuition was paid for under the Holloway Plan. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service as an aviator in the U.S. Navy, then completion of the final two years of their bachelor's degree.[20] Armstrong did not take courses in naval science, nor did he join the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps.[22]\n\n\n\n## Navy service[edit]\n\n\n![A black-and-white image of a light-skinned man in his early 20s.

After passing the medical examinations, he became a midshipman on February 24, 1949.[23] Flight training was conducted in a North American SNJ trainer, in which he soloed on September 9, 1949.[24] On March 2, 1950, he made his first aircraft carrier landing on USS\u00a0*Cabot*, an achievement he considered comparable to his first solo flight.[24] He was then sent to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas for training on the Grumman F8F Bearcat, culminating in a carrier landing on USS\u00a0*Wright*. On August 16, 1950, Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified naval aviator. His mother and sister attended his graduation ceremony on August 23, 1950.[25]\n\n\nArmstrong was assigned to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron\u00a07 (FASRON 7) at NAS San Diego (now known as NAS North Island). On November 27, 1950, he was assigned to VF-51, an all-jet squadron, becoming its youngest officer, and made his first flight in a jet, a Grumman F9F Panther, on January 5, 1951. He was promoted to ensign on June 5, 1951, and made his first jet carrier landing on USS\u00a0*Essex* two days later. On June 28, 1951, *Essex* had set sail for Korea, with VF-51 aboard to act as ground-attack aircraft. VF-51 flew ahead to Naval Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, where it conducted fighter-bomber training before rejoining the ship at the end of July.[26]\n\n\nOn August 29, 1951, Armstrong saw action in the Korean War as an escort for a photo reconnaissance plane over Songjin.[27] Five days later, on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. According to Armstrong, he was making a low bombing run at 350\u00a0mph (560\u00a0km/h) when 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) of his wing was torn off after it collided with a cable that was strung across the hills as a booby trap. He was flying 500 feet (150\u00a0m) above the ground when he hit it. While there was heavy anti-aircraft fire in the area, none hit Armstrong's aircraft.[28] An initial report to the commanding officer of *Essex* said that Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. The report indicated he was trying to regain control and collided with a pole, which sliced off 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of the Panther's right wing. Further perversions of the story by different authors added that he was only 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) from the ground and that 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of his wing was sheared off.[29]\n\n\n\n![Two dark-blue-painted single-seat military jets flying from left to right in echelon.

The planes have wingtip drop tanks and bubble canopies.](image)F9F-2 Panthers over Korea, with Armstrong piloting S-116 (left)\nArmstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due to the loss of the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He intended to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, but his parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of his aircraft, F9F-2 BuNo *125122*.[30]\n\n\nIn all, Armstrong flew 78\u00a0missions over Korea for a total of 121\u00a0hours in the air, a third of them in January 1952, with the final mission on March 5, 1952. Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War, 27 of them were from *Essex* on this war cruise. Armstrong received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions, two gold stars for the next 40, the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star, the National Defense Service Medal, and the United Nations Korea Medal.[31]\n\n\nArmstrong's regular commission was terminated on February 25, 1952, and he became an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. On completion of his combat tour with *Essex*, he was assigned to a transport squadron, VR-32, in May 1952. He was released from active duty on August 23, 1952, but remained in the reserve, and was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on May 9, 1953.[32] As a reservist, he continued to fly, with VF-724 at Naval Air Station Glenview in Illinois, and then, after moving to California, with VF-773 at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos.[33] He remained in the reserve for eight years, before resigning his commission on October 21, 1960.[32]\n\n\n\n## College years[edit]\n\n\nAfter his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue. His previously earned good but not outstanding grades now improved, lifting his final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and lived in its fraternity house. He wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue. The first was a version of *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*, co-directed with his girlfriend Joanne Alford from the Alpha Chi Omega sorority, with songs from the 1937 Walt Disney film, including \"Someday My Prince Will Come\"; the second was titled *The Land of Egelloc* (\"college\" spelled backward), with music from Gilbert and Sullivan but new lyrics. \n\n\nArmstrong was chairman of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the club's aircraft, an Aeronca and a couple of Pipers, which were kept at nearby Aretz Airport in Lafayette, Indiana. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, he damaged it in a rough landing in a farmer's field, and it had to be hauled back to Lafayette on a trailer.[34] He was a baritone player in the Purdue All-American Marching Band.[35] Ten years later he was made an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi national band honorary fraternity.[36] Armstrong graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in January 1955.[33] In 1970, he completed his Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC).[37] He would eventually be awarded honorary doctorates by several universities.[38]\n\n\nArmstrong met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics, at a party hosted by Alpha Chi Omega.[39] According to the couple, there was no real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley, near Edwards AFB. Janet did not finish her degree, a fact she regretted later in life. The couple had three children.[40] In June 1961, their daughter Karen was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem.[41] X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk. She died of pneumonia, related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962, aged two.[42]\n\n\n\n## Test pilot[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base.[43] NACA had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955.[43] Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted only a couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work there on July 11, 1955.[44]\n\n\n\n![A black-and-white photo of a young man with light skin and pale irises.

He also flew the modified bombers, and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, he was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress,[45] which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. He sat in the right-hand co-pilot seat while pilot in command, Stan Butchart sat in the left-hand pilot seat flying the B-29.[46]\n\n\nAs they climbed to 30,000 feet (9\u00a0km), the number-four engine stopped and the propeller began windmilling (rotating freely) in the airstream. Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller's spinning, Butchart found it slowed but then started spinning again, this time even faster than the others; if it spun too fast, it would break apart. Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of 210\u00a0mph (338\u00a0km/h) to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down attitude to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number-three engine, along with the number-one engine, due to the torque it created. They made a slow, circling descent from 30,000\u00a0ft (9\u00a0km) using only the number-two engine, and landed safely.[47]\n\n\nArmstrong served as project pilot on Century Series fighters, including the North American F-100 Super Sabre A and C variants, the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. He also flew the Douglas DC-3, Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, North American F-86 Sabre, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the Parasev paraglider research vehicle program.[48] Over his career, he flew more than 200 different models of aircraft.[37] His first flight in a rocket-powered aircraft was on August 15, 1957, in the Bell X-1B, to an altitude of 11.4 miles (18.3\u00a0km). On landing, the poorly designed nose landing gear failed, as had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X-1B. He flew the North American X-15 seven times,[49] including the first flight with the Q-ball system, the first flight of the number\u00a03 X-15 airframe, and the first flight of the MH-96 adaptive flight control system.[50][51] He became an employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) when it was established on October 1, 1958, absorbing NACA.[52]\n\n\nArmstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. During his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, Armstrong was testing the MH-96 control system when he flew to a height of over 207,000 feet (63\u00a0km) (the highest he flew before Gemini 8). He held up the aircraft nose during its descent to demonstrate the MH-96's g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around 140,000 feet (43\u00a0km). He flew past the landing field at Mach\u00a03 at over 100,000 feet (30\u00a0km) in altitude, and ended up 40 miles (64\u00a0km) south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he turned back toward the landing area, and landed. It was the longest X-15 flight in both flight time and length of the ground track.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![A black-and-white photo of Armstrong, with very short hair.

Milt Thompson said he was \"the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots\". Bill Dana said Armstrong \"had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge\". Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion, especially people like Chuck Yeager and Pete Knight, who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew in a way that was \"more mechanical than it is flying\", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: Their flying skills did not come naturally.[56] Armstrong made seven flights in the X-15 between November 30, 1960, and July 26, 1962.[57] He reached a top speed of Mach 5.74 (3,989\u00a0mph, 6,420\u00a0km/h) in the X-15-1, and left the Flight Research Center with a total of 2,400 flying hours.[58]\n\n\nOn April 24, 1962, Armstrong flew for the only time with Yeager. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. As Armstrong told the story, Yeager never tried to talk him out of it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck, provoking Yeager to fits of laughter.[59]\n\n\nOn May 21, 1962, Armstrong was involved in the \"Nellis Affair\". He was sent in an F-104 to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base, past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tailhook to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.[60]\n\n\nIt took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33, but he almost landed long. The Nellis base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.[60]\n\n\n\n## Astronaut career[edit]\n\n\n![Armstrong standing up, wearing an early space suit. It is highly reflective silver in appearance. He is wearing the helmet, which is white, with the visor raised. A thick dark hose is connected to one of the two ports on the front abdomen of the suit.](image)Armstrong in an early Gemini space suit\nIn June 1958, Armstrong was selected for the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program, but the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) canceled its funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, it was superseded by Project Mercury, a civilian project run by NASA. As a NASA civilian test pilot, Armstrong was ineligible to become one of its astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots.[61][62] In November 1960, he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when it got off the design board.[63][64]\n\n\nIn April 1962, NASA sought applications for the second group of NASA astronauts for Project Gemini, a proposed two-man spacecraft. This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots.[65] Armstrong visited the Seattle World's Fair in May 1962 and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After he returned from Seattle on June 4, he applied to become an astronaut. His application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed.[66] At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.[67]\n\n\nNASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked whether he would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of what the press dubbed \"the New Nine\"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the \"first civilian astronaut\".[68] Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;[69] the other was Elliot See, another former naval aviator.[70] NASA selected the second group that, compared with the Mercury Seven astronauts, were younger,[67] and had more impressive academic credentials.[71] Collins wrote that Armstrong was by far the most experienced test pilot in the Astronaut Corps.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gemini program[edit]\n\n\n#### Gemini 5[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 1965, Armstrong and Elliot See were picked as the backup crew for Gemini 5, with Armstrong as commander, supporting the prime crew of Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad.[72] The mission's purpose was to practice space rendezvous and to develop procedures and equipment for a seven-day flight, all of which would be required for a mission to the Moon. With two other flights (Gemini 3 and Gemini 4) in preparation, six crews were competing for simulator time, so Gemini\u00a05 was postponed. It finally lifted off on August 21.[73] Armstrong and See watched the launch at Cape Kennedy, then flew to the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston.[74] The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous. Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target.[75]\n\n\n\n\n#### Gemini 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gemini 8\n\n![Armstrong, with short hair, partially reclining on a beige chair.

Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission became the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated David Scott as the pilot of Gemini\u00a08.[76][77] Scott was the first member of the third group of astronauts, who was selected on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment.[78] See was designated to command Gemini 9. Henceforth, each Gemini mission was commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Scott's group as the pilot. Conrad would be Armstrong's backup this time, and Richard F. Gordon Jr. his pilot.[76][77] Armstrong became the first American civilian in space. (Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union had become the first civilian\u2014and first woman\u2014nearly three years earlier aboard Vostok 6 when it launched on June 16, 1963.[79]) Armstrong would also be the last of his group to fly in space, as See died in a T-38 crash on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett. They were replaced by the backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, while Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin moved up from the backup crew of Gemini 10 to become the backup for Gemini 9,[80] and would eventually fly Gemini 12.[81]\n\n\nGemini 8 launched on March 16, 1966. It was the most complex mission yet, with a rendezvous and docking with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle, and the planned second American space walk (EVA) by Scott. The mission was planned to last 75\u00a0hours and 55\u00a0orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10:00:00 EST,[82] the Titan II rocket carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02 EST, putting them into an orbit from which they chased the Agena.[83] They achieved the first-ever docking between two spacecraft.[84] Contact with the crew was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. While out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Gemini's Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS). Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but the roll increased dramatically until they were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with Gemini's attitude control. Armstrong engaged the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turned off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft had to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring caused one of the thrusters to stick in the on position.[85]\n\n\n\n![A dark gray Gemini capsule floats horizontally in blue water.

These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures had been written, and it was possible to turn on only both RCS rings, not one or the other.[87] Gene Kranz wrote, \"The crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.\" The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft were docked, they must be considered one spacecraft. Kranz considered this the mission's most important lesson.[88] Armstrong was depressed that the mission was cut short,[89] canceling most mission objectives and robbing Scott of his EVA. The Agena was later reused as a docking target by Gemini 10.[90] Armstrong and Scott received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal,[91][92] and the Air Force awarded Scott the Distinguished Flying Cross as well.[93] Scott was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Armstrong received a $678 raise in pay to $21,653 a year (equivalent to $203,338 in 2023), making him NASA's highest-paid astronaut.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Gemini 11[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gemini 11\n\nIn Armstrong's final assignment in the Gemini program, he was the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup pilot, William Anders.[94] The launch was on September 12, 1966,[95] with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM).[96]\n\n\nFollowing the flight, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24-day goodwill tour of South America.[97] Also on the tour, which took in 11\u00a0countries and 14\u00a0major cities, were Dick Gordon, George Low, their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong greeted dignitaries in their local language, Guarani; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont.[98]\n\n\n\n### Apollo program[edit]\n\n\nOn January 27, 1967\u2014the day of the Apollo 1 fire\u2014Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the MSC. During these calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee in the fire. Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.[99]\n\n\nOn April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo\u00a01 investigation released its final report, Armstrong and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\"[100] According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise\u2014the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.[101]\n\n\nThe crew was officially assigned on November 20, 1967.[102] For crewmates, Armstrong was assigned Lovell and Aldrin, from Gemini 12. After design and manufacturing delays of the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and\u00a09 swapped prime and backup crews. Based on the normal crew rotation, Armstrong would command Apollo 11,[101] with one change: Collins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[103] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew, and, when Collins recovered, he joined Armstrong's crew.[104]\n\n\n\n![An indistinct photo of a smoke trail rising from an area of orange fire in a recently harvested field. A white and orange parachute is recovering a human figure above and to the right of the fire.](image)Armstrong descends to the ground on a parachute after ejecting from Lunar Landing Research Vehicle 1.To give the astronauts practice piloting the LM on its descent, NASA commissioned Bell Aircraft to build two Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the \"Flying Bedsteads\", they simulated the Moon's one-sixth gravity using a turbofan engine to support five-sixths of the craft's weight. On May 6, 1968, 100 feet (30\u00a0m) above the ground, Armstrong's controls started to degrade and the LLRV began rolling.[105] He ejected safely before the vehicle struck the ground and burst into flames. Later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time. His only injury was from biting his tongue. The LLRV was completely destroyed.[106] Even though he was nearly killed, Armstrong maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as they gave commanders essential experience in piloting the lunar landing craft.[107]\n\n\nIn addition to the LLRV training, NASA began lunar landing simulator training after Apollo 10 was completed. Aldrin and Armstrong trained for a variety of scenarios that could develop during a real lunar landing.[108] They also received briefings from geologists at NASA.[109]\n\n\n\n#### Apollo 11[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 11\n\n![Three astronauts in white space suits.

After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the lunar module pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number\u00a03 position of the crew.[111] The crew of Apollo 11 was assigned on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders, and Fred Haise as the backup crew.[112]\n\n\nAccording to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[115]\n\n\n\n#### Voyage to the Moon[edit]\n\n\nA Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (09:32:00 EDT local time).[116] Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the Banana River.[117] During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110\u00a0beats per minute.[118] He found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini\u00a08 Titan II launch. The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics.[119]\n\n\n\n![Armstrong smiling in his space suit with the helmet off. He wears a headset and his eyes look slightly watery.](image)Armstrong in the lunar module after the completion of the EVA\nApollo 11's objective was to land safely on the Moon, rather than to touch down at a precise location. Three minutes into the lunar descent, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Lunar Module *Eagle* would probably touch down several miles (kilometres) beyond the planned landing zone.[120] As the *Eagle*'s landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms sounded. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin knew what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by executive overflows in the lunar module guidance computer. In 2007, Aldrin said the overflows were caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, causing the computer to process unnecessary radar data. When it did not have enough time to execute all tasks, the computer dropped the lower-priority ones, triggering the alarms. Aldrin said he decided to leave the radar on in case an abort was necessary when re-docking with the Apollo command module; he did not realize it would cause the processing overflows.[121]\n\n\n\nArmstrong lands the Lunar Module *Eagle* on the Moon, July 20, 1969.\nWhen Armstrong noticed they were heading toward a landing area that seemed unsafe, he took manual control of the LM and attempted to find a safer area. This took longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken.[122] For this reason, Mission Control was concerned that the LM was running low on fuel.[123] On landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had 40\u00a0seconds of fuel left, including the 20\u00a0seconds' worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort.[124] During training, Armstrong had, on several occasions, landed with fewer than 15\u00a0seconds of fuel; he was also confident the LM could survive a fall of up to 50 feet (15\u00a0m). Post-mission analysis showed that at touchdown there were 45 to 50\u00a0seconds of propellant burn time left.[125]\n\n\nThe landing on the surface of the Moon occurred several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969.[126] One of three 67-inch (170\u00a0cm) probes attached to three of the LM's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light in the LM illuminated, and Aldrin called out, \"Contact light.\" Armstrong shut the engine off and said, \"Shutdown.\" As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, \"Okay, engine stop\"; then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a 10-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, \"We copy you down, *Eagle*.\" Armstrong confirmed the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The *Eagle* has landed.\" Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back. They then returned to the checklist of contingency tasks, should an emergency liftoff become necessary.[127][128][129] After Armstrong confirmed touch down, Duke re-acknowledged, adding a comment about the flight crew's relief: \"Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"[124] During the landing, Armstrong's heart rate ranged from 100 to 150\u00a0beats per minute.[130]\n\n\n\n#### First Moon walk[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Apollo 11\u2014Lunar surface operations\n\nArmstrong describes the lunar surface.\n![](image)\n\n\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nThe flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the module, but Armstrong asked for this to be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, *Eagle* was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder.[131] At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a Lunar Module landing pad, Armstrong said, \"I'm going to step off the LM now\". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969,[132] then said, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[133] The exact time of Armstrong's first step on the Moon is unclear.[134]\n\n\nArmstrong prepared his famous epigram on his own.[135] In a post-flight press conference, he said that he chose the words \"just prior to leaving the LM.\"[136] In a 1983 interview in *Esquire* magazine, he explained to George Plimpton: \"I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touch down on the moon surface were about even money\u2014fifty\u2013fifty\u00a0... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing.\"[135] In 2012, his brother Dean Armstrong said that Neil showed him a draft of the line months before the launch.[137] Historian Andrew Chaikin, who interviewed Armstrong in 1988 for his book *A Man on the Moon*, disputed that Armstrong claimed to have conceived the line during the mission.[138]\n\n\nRecordings of Armstrong's transmission does not provide evidence for the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\", though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static obscured it. Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to recordings, he eventually conceded he must have dropped the \"a\".[133] He later said he \"would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended, even if it was not said\u2014although it might actually have been\".[139] There have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing \"a\";[133][140] Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer, conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did say \"a man\", but the \"a\" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time.[133][141][142] Ford and James R. Hansen, Armstrong's authorized biographer, presented these findings to Armstrong and NASA representatives, who conducted their own analysis.[143] Armstrong found Ford's analysis \"persuasive.\"[144][145] Linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman wrote of their skepticism of Ford's claims on the blog Language Log.[146] A 2016 peer-reviewed study again concluded Armstrong had included the article.[147] NASA's transcript continues to show the \"a\" in parentheses.[148]\n\n\nWhen Armstrong made his proclamation, Voice of America was rebroadcast live by the BBC and many other stations worldwide. An estimated 530\u00a0million people viewed the event,[149] 20 percent out of a world population of approximately 3.6\u00a0billion.[150][151]\u00a0\n\n\n\n> \n> Q: Did you misspeak?\n> \n> \n> A: There isn't any way of knowing.\n> \n> \n> Q: Several sources say you did.\n> \n> \n> A: I mean, there isn't any way of *my* knowing. When I listen to the tape, I can't hear the 'a', but that doesn't mean it wasn't there, because that was the fastest VOX ever built. There was no mike-switch \u2014 it was a voice-operated key or VOX. In a helmet you find you lose a lot of syllables. Sometimes a short syllable like 'a' might not be transmitted. However, when I listen to it, I can't hear it. But the 'a' is implied, so I'm happy if they just put it in parentheses.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*Omni*, June 1982, p. 126\n\n![A grainy picture from behind of a human figure in white space suit and backpack standing in front of the Lunar Module on the surface of the Moon. A landing leg is visible and the U.S. flag on the descent stage.](image)Armstrong on the Moon\nAbout 19\u00a0minutes after Armstrong's first step, Aldrin joined him on the surface, becoming the second human to walk on the Moon. They began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating the flight, and with Aldrin, planted the flag of the United States. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole,[152] it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontally.[153] However, the rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze.[154] Shortly after the flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by telephone from his office. He spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.[155] In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. The mission was planned to the minute, with the majority of photographic tasks performed by Armstrong with the single Hasselblad camera.[156]\n\n\nAfter helping to set up the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package, Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater, 65 yards (59\u00a0m) east of the LM, the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission. His final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov, and Apollo\u00a01 astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee.[157] The Apollo 11 EVA lasted two and a half hours.[158] Each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer EVA period; the crew of Apollo 17 spent over 22\u00a0hours exploring the lunar surface.[158] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited their Moon walk because they were unsure how the space suits would cope with the Moon's extremely high temperature.[159]\n\n\n\n##### Return to Earth[edit]\n\n\n![The three crew members smiling at the President through the glass window of their metal quarantine chamber.

While preparing for liftoff, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky space suits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed in the circuit breaker to start the launch sequence.[160] The *Eagle* then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with *Columbia*, the command and service module. The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, to be picked up by the USS\u00a0*Hornet*.[161]\n\n\n\nAfter being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew was feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour.[162] \n\n![](image)New York City ticker tape parade, August 13, 1969\nThe tour began on August 13, when the three astronauts spoke and rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[163][164] On the same evening an official state dinner was held in Los Angeles to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44\u00a0governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83\u00a0nations. President Nixon and Vice President Agnew presented each astronaut with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.[163][165]\n\n\nAfter the tour Armstrong took part in Bob Hope's 1969 USO show, primarily to Vietnam.[166] In May 1970, Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research; after arriving in Leningrad from Poland, he traveled to Moscow where he met Premier Alexei Kosygin. Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, which he described as \"a bit Victorian in nature\".[167] At the end of the day, he was surprised to view a delayed video of the launch of Soyuz 9 as it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place, even though Valentina Tereshkova had been his host and her husband, Andriyan Nikolayev, was on board.[168]\n\n\n\n## Life after Apollo[edit]\n\n\n![A black-and-white image.

He took a heavy teaching load, taught core classes, and created two graduate-level classes: aircraft design and experimental flight mechanics. He was considered a good teacher, and a tough grader. His research activities during this time did not involve his work at NASA, as he did not want to give the appearance of favoritism; he later regretted the decision. After teaching for eight years, Armstrong resigned in 1980. When the university changed from an independent municipal university to a state school, bureaucracy increased. He did not want to be a part of the faculty collective bargaining group, so he decided to teach half-time. According to Armstrong, he had the same amount of work but received half his salary. In 1979, less than 10% of his income came from his university salary. Employees at the university did not know why he left.[174]\n\n\n\n### NASA commissions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, after an explosion aboard Apollo 13 aborted its lunar landing, Armstrong was part of Edgar Cortright's investigation of the mission. He produced a detailed chronology of the flight. He determined that a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version, led to the explosion. Cortright's report recommended the entire tank be redesigned at a cost of $40\u00a0million. Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, opposed the recommendation, since only the thermostat switch had caused the problem. They lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned.[175]\n\n\nIn 1986, President Ronald Reagan asked Armstrong to join the Rogers Commission investigating the Space Shuttle *Challenger* disaster. Armstrong was made vice chairman of the commission and held private interviews with contacts he had developed over the years to help determine the cause of the disaster. He helped limit the committee's recommendations to nine, believing that if there were too many, NASA would not act on them.[176]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Collins, President George W. Bush, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin during celebrations of the 35th anniversary of the Apollo 11 flight, July 21, 2004\nArmstrong was appointed to a fourteen-member commission by President Reagan to develop a plan for American civilian spaceflight in the 21st century. The commission was chaired by former NASA administrator Dr. Thomas O. Paine, with whom Armstrong had worked during the Apollo program. The group published a book titled *Pioneering the Space Frontier: The Report on the National Commission on Space*, recommending a permanent lunar base by 2006, and sending people to Mars by 2015. The recommendations were largely ignored, overshadowed by the *Challenger* disaster.[177]\n\n\nArmstrong and his wife attended the memorial service for the victims of the Space Shuttle *Columbia* disaster in 2003, at the invitation of President George W. Bush.[178]\n\n\n\n### Business activities[edit]\n\n\nAfter Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America.[179] He acted as a spokesman for only American companies.[180]\n\n\nIn addition to his duties as a spokesman, he also served on the board of directors of several companies. The first company board Armstrong joined was Gates Learjet, chairing their technical committee. He flew their new and experimental jets and even set a climb and altitude record for business jets. Armstrong became a member of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company's board in 1973. They were interested in nuclear power and wanted to increase the company's technical competence. He served on the board of Taft Broadcasting, also based in Cincinnati. Armstrong joined the board of solid rocket booster Thiokol in 1989, after previously serving on the Rogers Commission which found that the Space Shuttle *Challenger* was destroyed due to a defect in the Thiokol-manufactured solid rocket boosters. When Armstrong left the University of Cincinnati, he became the chairman of Cardwell International Ltd., a company that manufactured drilling rigs. He served on additional aerospace boards, first United Airlines in 1978, and later Eaton Corporation in 1980. He was asked to chair the board of directors for a subsidiary of Eaton, AIL Systems. He chaired the board through the company's 2000 merger with EDO Corporation, until his retirement in 2002.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### North Pole expedition[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the \"greatest explorers\" to the North Pole. The group included Armstrong, Edmund Hillary, Hillary's son Peter, Steve Fossett, and Patrick Morrow. They arrived at the Pole on April 6, 1985. Armstrong said he was curious to see what it looked like from the ground, as he had seen it only from the Moon.[183] He did not inform the media of the trip, preferring to keep it private.[184]\n\n\n\n### Public profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Armstrong in 1999\nArmstrong's family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\".[185][186][187] He kept a low profile later in his life, leading to the belief that he was a recluse.[188][189] Recalling Armstrong's humility, John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, told CNN: \"[Armstrong] didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself. He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before.\"[190] Armstrong turned down most requests for interviews and public appearances. Michael Collins said in his book *Carrying the Fire* that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor, it was like he \"retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge\". Armstrong found this amusing, and said, \"...\u00a0those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems.\"[191]\n\n\nAndrew Chaikin says in *A Man on the Moon* that Armstrong kept a low profile but was not a recluse, citing his participation in interviews, advertisements for Chrysler, and hosting a cable television series.[192] Between 1991 and 1993, he hosted *First Flights with Neil Armstrong*, an aviation history documentary series on A&E.[191] In 2010, Armstrong voiced the character of Dr. Jack Morrow in *Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey*,[193] an animated educational sci-fi adventure film initiated by JPL/NASA through a grant from Jet Propulsion Lab.[194]\n\n\nArmstrong guarded the use of his name, image, and famous quote. When it was launched in 1981, MTV wanted to use his quote in its station identification, with the American flag replaced with the MTV logo, but he refused the use of his voice and likeness.[195] He sued Hallmark Cards in 1994, when they used his name, and a recording of the \"one small step\" quote, in a Christmas ornament without his permission. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which Armstrong donated to Purdue.[196][197]\n\n\nFor many years, he wrote letters congratulating new Eagle Scouts on their accomplishment, but decided to quit the practice in the 1990s because he felt the letters should be written by people who knew the scout. (In 2003, he received 950\u00a0congratulation requests.) This contributed to the myth of his reclusiveness.[198] Armstrong used to autograph everything except first day covers. Around 1993, he found out his signatures were being sold online, and that most of them were forgeries, and stopped giving autographs.[189]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![An elderly but fit-looking Armstrong in mid-speech. He is wearing a dark suit, a white shirt and a pale blue tie. He holds up his left hand and touches the thumb to the middle finger.](image)Armstrong speaking in February 2012, six months before his death, on the 50th anniversary of John Glenn's first spaceflight\nSome former astronauts, including Glenn and Harrison Schmitt, sought political careers after leaving NASA. Armstrong was approached by groups from both the Democratic and Republican parties but declined the offers. He supported states' rights and opposed the U.S. acting as the \"world's policeman\".[199]\n\n\nWhen Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop in the late 1950s, he gave his religious affiliation as \"deist\".[200] His mother later said that his religious views caused her grief and distress in later life, as she was more religious.[201] Upon his return from the Moon, Armstrong gave a speech in front of the U.S. Congress in which he thanked them for giving him the opportunity to see some of the \"grandest views of the Creator\".[202][203] In the early 1980s, he was the subject of a hoax claiming that he converted to Islam after hearing the call to prayer while walking on the Moon. Indonesian singer Suhaemi wrote a song called \"Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan\" (\"The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon\") which described Armstrong's supposed conversion, and the song was widely discussed by Jakarta news outlets in 1983.[204] Similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia. In March 1983, the U.S. State Department responded by issuing a message to embassies and consulates in Muslim countries saying that Armstrong had not converted to Islam.[205] The hoax surfaced occasionally for the next three decades. Part of the confusion arose from the similarity between the names of the country of Lebanon, which has a majority Muslim population, and Armstrong's longtime residence in Lebanon, Ohio.[205]\n\n\nIn 1972, Armstrong visited the Scottish town of Langholm, the traditional seat of Clan Armstrong. He was made the first freeman of the burgh, and happily declared the town his home.[206] To entertain the crowd, the Justice of the Peace read from an unrepealed archaic 400-year-old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town.[207]\n\n\nArmstrong flew light aircraft for pleasure. He enjoyed gliders and before the Moon flight had earned a gold badge with two diamonds from the International Gliding Commission. He continued to fly engineless aircraft well into his 70s.[208]\n\n\nWhile working on his farm in November 1978, Armstrong jumped off the back of his grain truck and caught his wedding ring in its wheel, tearing the tip off his left ring finger. He collected the severed tip, packed it in ice, and had surgeons reattach it at a nearby Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.[209] In February 1991, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.[210]\n\n\nArmstrong and his first wife, Janet, separated in 1990 and divorced in 1994 after 38 years of marriage.[211][212] He met his second wife, Carol Held Knight, at a golf tournament in 1992, when they were seated together at breakfast. She said little to Armstrong, but he called her two weeks later to ask what she was doing. She replied that she was cutting down a cherry tree, and he arrived at her house 35 minutes later to help. They were married in Ohio on June 12, 1994, and had a second ceremony at San Ysidro Ranch in California. They lived in Indian Hill, Ohio.[213][214] Through his marriage to Carol, he was the father-in-law of future New York Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen.\n\n\nIn May 2005, Armstrong became involved in a legal dispute with Mark Sizemore, his barber of 20\u00a0years. After cutting Armstrong's hair, Sizemore sold some of it to a collector for $3,000 without Armstrong's knowledge.[215] Armstrong threatened legal action against Sizemore unless he returned the hair or donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong's choosing. Sizemore, unable to retrieve the hair, donated the proceeds to charity.[216][217]\n\n\n\n## Illness and death[edit]\n\n\n![A color image showing a black-and-white photo of a young boy. The picture stands on a small round table beside a vase of flowers containing a U.S. flag.](image)Photograph of Armstrong as a boy at his family memorial service in Indian Hill, Ohio, near Cincinnati, on August 31, 2012\nArmstrong underwent bypass surgery at Mercy Faith\u2013Fairfield Hospital in Cincinnati on August 7, 2012, to relieve coronary artery disease.[218][219] Although he was reportedly recovering well,[220] he developed complications and died on August 25, aged 82.[221][222] President Barack Obama issued a statement memorializing Armstrong as \"among the greatest of American heroes\u2014not just of his time, but of all time\",[223][224] and added that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and had delivered \"a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\"[225]\n\n\n\n![A squad of eight U.S. Navy personnel dressed in all-white uniforms hold a U.S. flag over a casket on the deck of a ship.

Beyond is the sea.](image)Armstrong's burial at sea on September 14, 2012\nArmstrong's family released a statement describing him as a \"reluctant American hero [who had] served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut\u00a0... While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\"[226] It prompted many responses, including the Twitter hashtag \"#WinkAtTheMoon\".[227][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nBuzz Aldrin called Armstrong \"a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew\", and said he was disappointed that they would not be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing together in 2019.[228][229] Michael Collins said, \"He was the best, and I will miss him terribly.\"[230][231] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, \"As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own\".[232][233]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Memorial service for Armstrong, Washington National Cathedral, September 13, 2012, C-SPAN |\n\n\nA tribute was held for Armstrong on September 13, at Washington National Cathedral, whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of Moon rock amid its stained-glass panels.[234] In attendance were Armstrong's Apollo 11 crewmates, Collins and Aldrin; Gene Cernan, the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man to walk on the Moon; and former senator and astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. In his eulogy, Charles Bolden praised Armstrong's \"courage, grace, and humility\". Cernan recalled Armstrong's low-fuel approach to the Moon: \"When the gauge says empty, we all know there's a gallon or two left in the tank!\" Diana Krall sang the song \"Fly Me to the Moon\". Collins led prayers. David Scott spoke, possibly for the first time, about an incident during their Gemini\u00a08 mission: minutes before the hatch was to be sealed, a small chip of dried glue fell into the latch of his harness and prevented it from being buckled, threatening to abort the mission. Armstrong then called on Conrad to solve the problem, which he did, and the mission proceeded. \"That happened because Neil Armstrong was a team player\u2014he always worked on behalf of the team.\"[234] Congressman Bill Johnson from Armstrong's home state of Ohio led calls for President Barack Obama to authorize a state funeral in Washington D.C. Throughout his lifetime, Armstrong shunned publicity and rarely gave interviews. Mindful that Armstrong would have objected to a state funeral, his family opted to have a private funeral in Cincinnati.[235] On September 14, Armstrong's cremated remains were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean from the USS\u00a0*Philippine Sea*.[236] Flags were flown at half-staff on the day of Armstrong's funeral.[237]\n\n\nIn July 2019, after observations of the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing, *The New York Times* reported on details of a medical malpractice suit Armstrong's family had filed against Mercy Health\u2013Fairfield Hospital, where he died. When Armstrong appeared to be recovering from his bypass surgery, nurses removed the wires connected to his temporary pacemaker. He began to bleed internally and his blood pressure dropped. Doctors took him to the hospital's catheterization laboratory, and only later began operating. Two of the three physicians who reviewed the medical files during the lawsuit called this a serious error, saying surgery should have begun immediately; experts the *Times* talked to, while qualifying their judgement by noting that they were unable to review the specific records in the case, said that taking a patient directly to the operating room under those circumstances generally gave them the highest chance of survival.[218]\n\n\nThe family ultimately settled for $6\u00a0million in 2014. Letters included with the 93\u00a0pages of documents sent to the *Times* by an unknown individual[238] show that his sons intimated to the hospital, through their lawyers, that they might discuss what happened to their father publicly at the 45th anniversary observances in 2014. The hospital, fearing the bad publicity that would result from being accused of negligently causing the death of a revered figure such as Armstrong, agreed to pay as long as the family never spoke about the suit or the settlement.[218] Armstrong's wife, Carol, was not a party to the lawsuit. She reportedly felt that her husband would have been opposed to taking legal action.[239]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Armstrong gives an acceptance speech after being inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida.\nWhen Pete Conrad of Apollo 12 became the third man to walk on the Moon, on November 19, 1969, his first words referenced Armstrong. The shorter of the two, when Conrad stepped from the LM onto the surface he proclaimed \"Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\"[240]\n\n\nArmstrong received many honors and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction) from President Nixon,[163][241] the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society,[242] and the Collier Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association (1969);[243] the NASA Distinguished Service Medal[244] and the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy (1970);[245] the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy (1971);[246] the Congressional Space Medal of Honor from President Jimmy Carter (1978);[91] the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association (2001);[247] and a Congressional Gold Medal (2011).[248]\n\n\nArmstrong was elected as member into the National Academy of Engineering in 1978 for contributions to aerospace engineering, scientific knowledge, and exploration of the universe as an experimental test pilot and astronaut.[249] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2001.[250]\n\n\nArmstrong and his Apollo 11 crewmates were the 1999 recipients of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.[251] On April 18, 2006, he received NASA's Ambassador of Exploration Award.[252] The Space Foundation named Armstrong as a recipient of its 2013 General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.[253] Armstrong was also inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor,[254][255] the International Space Hall of Fame,[256] National Aviation Hall of Fame, and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[257][258] He was awarded his Naval Astronaut badge in a ceremony on board the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Dwight D. Eisenhower* on March 10, 2010, in a ceremony attended by Lovell and Cernan.[259]\n\n\n\n![The astronauts are all elderly but standing straight.

Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2014.[269] In September 2012, the U.S. Navy named the first *Armstrong*-class vessel RV\u00a0*Neil Armstrong*. Delivered to the Navy on September 23, 2015, it is a modern oceanographic research platform supporting a wide range of activities by academic groups.[270] In 2019, the College of Engineering at Purdue University celebrated the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's walk on the Moon by launching the Neil Armstrong Distinguished Visiting Fellows Program, which brings highly accomplished scholars and practitioners to the college to catalyze collaborations with faculty and students.[271]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Presentation by James Hansen on *First Man*, November 9, 2005, C-SPAN |\n\n\nArmstrong's authorized biography, *First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong*, was published in 2005. For many years, he turned down biography offers from authors such as Stephen Ambrose and James A. Michener but agreed to work with James R. Hansen after reading one of Hansen's other biographies.[272] He recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50% chance of landing on the Moon. \"I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful\".[273] A film adaptation of the book, starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Damien Chazelle, was released in October 2018.[274]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Armstrong's sons put his collection of memorabilia up for sale, including his Boy Scout cap, and various flags and medals flown on his space missions. A series of auctions was held on November 1 to 3, 2018, that realized $5,276,320 (~$6.31\u00a0million in 2023). As of July 2019[update], the auction sales have totaled $16.7\u00a0million.[239] Two fragments of wood from the propeller and four pieces of fabric from the wing of the 1903 *Wright Flyer* that Armstrong took to the Moon fetched between $112,500 and $275,000 each.[275][276] Armstrong's wife, Carol, has not put any of his memorabilia up for sale.[239]\n\n\nArmstrong donated his papers to Purdue. Along with posthumous donations by his widow Carol, the collection consists of over 450\u00a0boxes of material. In May 2019, she donated two 25-by-24-inch (640 by 610\u00a0mm) pieces of fabric from the *Wright Flyer*, along with his correspondence related to them.[277]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ohio's 50 State quarter depicts Armstrong and the Wright brothers' Wright Flyer III.\nIn a 2010 *Space Foundation* survey, Armstrong was ranked as the number-one most popular space hero;[278] and in 2013, *Flying* magazine ranked him number one on its list of 51 Heroes of Aviation.[279] The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight. In 2005, he said that a human mission to Mars would be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s. In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares I launch vehicle and the Constellation Moon landing program.[280] In an open letter also signed by fellow Apollo veterans Lovell and Cernan, he noted, \"For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature\".[281] On November 18, 2010, aged 80, he said in a speech during the *Science & Technology Summit* in the Hague, Netherlands, that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked.[282]\n\n\nThe planetarium at Altoona Area High School in Altoona, Pennsylvania is named after Neil Armstrong and is home to a Space Race museum.[283] Similarly, a campsite in Camp Sandy Beach at Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Rockville, Rhode Island, is named in his honor, a nod to his Scouting career.\n\n\nArmstrong was named the class exemplar for the Class of 2019 at the U.S. Air Force Academy.[284]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Apollo 11 in popular culture\n* Cueva de los Tayos\n* History of aviation\n* List of spaceflight records\n* Society of Experimental Test Pilots\n* The Astronaut Monument\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Armstrong's famous 'one small step' quote \u2014 explained\". *WHYY-FM*.

He was selected to become an astronaut by NASA in 1963 as part of Astronaut Group 3, and was the fourth person to walk on the Moon.\n\n\nBefore becoming an astronaut, Bean graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from University of Texas at Austin in 1955 and re-joined the U.S. Navy\u2014he served as an enlisted member for a year after his high school graduation. He received his naval aviator wings in 1956 and served as a fighter pilot. In 1960, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, flew as a test pilot and was The New Nine selection finalist in 1962.\n\n\nHe made his first flight into space aboard Apollo 12, the second crewed mission to land on the Moon, at age 37 in November 1969. He made his second and final flight into space on the Skylab 3 mission in 1973, the second crewed mission to the Skylab space station. After retiring from the United States Navy in 1975 and NASA in 1981, he pursued his interest in painting, depicting various space-related scenes and documenting his own experiences in space as well as those of his fellow Apollo program astronauts. He was the last living crew member of Apollo 12.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBean was born March 15, 1932,[3] in Wheeler, the seat of Wheeler County in the northeastern Texas Panhandle, to parents Arnold Horace Bean and Frances Caroline Bean (n\u00e9e Murphy), who lived from 1908 to 1983, and 1906 to 1981, respectively.[4][5][6] He considered Fort Worth his hometown.[7] He was of Scottish descent.[8] As a boy, he lived in Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where his father worked for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.[9][10] Bean was a Boy Scout and he earned the rank of First Class.[11] He graduated from R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1949.[12][13] Following his high school graduation in 1949, Bean enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve.[14]\n\n\nBean received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1955, where he attended on a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship.[14] While at the university, he also joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[15]\n\n\n\n### Military service[edit]\n\n\nHe was an Electronics Technician Striker at the NAS Dallas, Texas, until September 1950, when he was honorably discharged.[13] In January 1955, Bean was commissioned a U.S. Navy ensign through the NROTC at the University of Texas at Austin, and attended flight training.[12] After completing flight training in June 1956, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 44 (VA-44) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, from 1956 to 1960, flying the F9F Cougar and A4D Skyhawk. After a four-year tour of duty,[16] he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, where his instructor was his future Apollo 12 Commander, Pete Conrad, graduating in November 1960.[7][13] Bean took art classes at St. Mary's College of Maryland during this tour,[17] and flew as a test pilot on several types of naval aircraft. Following his assignment at USNTPS and aviation safety training with the University of Southern California (USC), he went through additional instruction with his old Attack Squadron 44,[13] and was assigned to Navy Attack Squadron VA-172 at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, flying the A-4 Skyhawks, during which time he was selected as a NASA astronaut.[14][18]\n\n\nBean logged more than 7,145 hours of flying time, including 4,890 hours in jet aircraft.[19]\n\n\n\n### NASA career[edit]\n\n\nBean was selected by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 3 in 1963 (after not being selected for Astronaut Group 2 the previous year).[20] He was selected to be the backup command pilot for Gemini 10, but was unsuccessful in securing an early Apollo flight assignment. He was placed in the Apollo Applications Program in the interim. In that capacity, he was the first astronaut to dive in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator and a champion of the process for astronaut training.[21] When fellow astronaut Clifton Williams was killed in an air crash, a space was opened for Bean on the backup crew for Apollo 9. Apollo 12 Commander Conrad, who had instructed Bean at the Naval Test Pilot School years before, personally requested Bean to replace Williams.[14][18]\n\n\n\n#### Apollo program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 12\n\n![](image)Bean during suiting-up for Apollo 12 flight\n![](image)Bean on the Moon during Apollo 12\nBean was the Apollo Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. In November 1969, Bean and Pete Conrad landed on the Moon's Ocean of Storms\u2014after a flight of 250,000 miles and a launch that included a harrowing lightning strike. He was the astronaut who executed John Aaron's \"Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'\" instruction to restore telemetry after the spacecraft was struck by lightning 36 seconds after launch, thus salvaging the mission. They explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the Moon to provide the power source. Dick Gordon remained in lunar orbit, photographing landing sites for future missions.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pete Conrad, Dick Gordon, and Alan Bean pose with their Apollo 12 Saturn V Moon rocket in the background on the pad at Cape Canaveral on October 29, 1969\nBean had planned on using a self-timer for his Hasselblad camera to take a photograph of both Pete Conrad and himself while on the lunar surface near the Surveyor III spacecraft. He was hoping to record a good photo, and also to confuse the mission scientists as to how the photo could have been taken. However, neither he nor Conrad could locate the timer in the tool carrier tote bag while at the Surveyor III site, thus lost the opportunity. After finding the self-timer unit at the end of the EVA, when it was too late to use, he threw it as far as he could.[22] His paintings of what this photo would have looked like (titled *The Fabulous Photo We Never Took*) and one of his fruitless search for the timer (*Our Little Secret*) are included in his collection of Apollo paintings.[23][24]\n\n\nBean's suit is on display in the National Air and Space Museum.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Skylab[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Skylab 3\n\n![](image)Bean shaving during the Skylab 3 mission\nBean was the spacecraft commander of Skylab 3, the second crewed mission to Skylab, from July 29 to September 25, 1973. With him on the mission were scientist-astronaut Owen Garriott and Marine Corps Colonel Jack R. Lousma. Bean and his crew were on Skylab for 59 days, during which time they covered a world-record-setting 24.4 million miles.[19] During the mission, Bean tested a prototype of the Manned Maneuvering Unit and performed one spacewalk outside the Skylab. The crew of Skylab 3 accomplished 150% of its mission goals.[19]\n\n\n\n### Post-NASA career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bean, February 2009\nOn his next assignment, Bean was the backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the joint American-Russian Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.[19]\n\n\nBean retired from the Navy in October 1975 as a captain, and continued as head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group within the Astronaut Office in a civilian capacity.[19][26]\n\n\nBean logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in space while at NASA, of which 10 hours and 26 minutes were spent in EVAs on the Moon and in Earth orbit.[19]\n\n\n\n## Painting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bean in his studio\nBean resigned from NASA in June 1981 to devote his time to painting. He said his decision was based on that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artist's eye, past or present, has ever viewed firsthand and he hoped to express these experiences through his art.[12]\n\n\nAs a painter, Bean wanted to add color to the Moon. \"I had to figure out a way to add color to the Moon without ruining it,\" he remarked. In his paintings, the lunar landscape is not a monotonous gray, but shades of various colors. \"If I were a scientist painting the Moon, I would paint it gray. I'm an artist, so I can add colors to the Moon\", said Bean.[27]\n\n\nBean's paintings include *Lunar Grand Prix* and *Rock and Roll on the Ocean of Storms*, and he used real Moon dust in his paintings.[28] When he began painting, he realized that keepsake patches from his space suit were dirty with Moon dust. He added tiny pieces of the patches to his paintings, which made them unique. He also used a hammer, used to pound the flagpole into the lunar surface, and a bronzed Moon boot to texture his paintings.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2009, for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Bean exhibited his lunar paintings at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington.[30]\n\n\n\n\n> But I'm the only one who can paint the Moon, because I'm the only one who knows whether that's right or not.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aBean describing his Moon painting capability[12]\n> \n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alan Bean museum marker in Wheeler, Texas\n![](image)Bean presents a piece of Moon rock at the Gasometer Oberhausen in March 2010\nBean took a piece of Clan MacBean tartan to the Moon.[31] In recognition of his Scottish ancestry, Bean stated:\n\n\n\n\n> As I remember it, I took Clan McBean tartan to the Moon and returned it to Earth. [\u2026] I did, in fact, give a piece of the tartan to the Clan McBean and also to the St Bean Chapel in Scotland. And I've still got some of it in my possession. I did not, however leave any of it on the Moon.[32]\n> \n> \n\n\nHe married Sue Ragsdale, a fellow graduate of the University of Texas on April 19, 1955, shortly before her graduation.[33] With Ragsdale, Bean had a son, Clay, and a daughter, Amy Sue.[34][35]\n\n\nBean died on May 26, 2018, in Houston, Texas, at the age of 86.[36] His death followed the sudden onset of illness two weeks before while he was in Fort Wayne, Indiana.[35] At the time of his death, Bean was married to his second wife, Leslie, and was also survived by his sister, Paula Scott.[35]\n\n\nBean was interred in Arlington National Cemetery on November 8, 2018.[37]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nHe was awarded with several awards and decorations during his career. He received the Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress,[19] the Godfrey L. Cabot Award for 1970,[19] the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Trustees Award,[19] the V. M. Komarov Diploma for 1973[19] and the AAS Flight Achievement Award for 1974.[19]\n\n\nBean received the Navy Astronaut Wings, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal (twice), the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (twice), and the National Defense Service Medal with bronze star.[13][19][38]\n\n\nBean was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983,[12][39] the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997,[40][41] the International Air & Space Hall of Fame in 2010,[42] and the National Aviation Hall of Fame for 2010.[43] He was also a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.[19]\n\n\nBean received the University of Texas Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1970 and the Distinguished Engineering Graduate Award.[44] Bean, the first Texan to walk on the Moon, was awarded the Texas Press Associations Texan of the Year Award for 1969.[45] The 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy was awarded to NASA and the Skylab crew.[46] Bean was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Texas Wesleyan College in 1972, and was presented an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering Science degree from the University of Akron (Ohio) in 1974.[19] The city of Chicago held a parade and presented gold medals to the Skylab astronauts in 1974.[47] Bean was the recipient of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale's prestigious Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal for 1973 in Sydney, Australia.[48] In 1975, President Ford presented Skylab commander Gerald Carr with the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy at a White House ceremony, on behalf of all Skylab astronauts (including Bean).[49] Bean was a co-recipient of AIAA's Octave Chanute Award for 1975, along with fellow Skylab 3 astronauts Jack Lousma and Owen Garriott.[50] In 2019, Northrop Grumman named the spacecraft for the NG-12 mission the *S.S. Alan Bean*.[51]\n\n\n\n## In media[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1998 HBO miniseries *From the Earth to the Moon*, Bean was portrayed by Dave Foley.[52] Swedish indie pop artist Stina Nordenstam has a song called \"The Return of Alan Bean\" on her 1991 debut album *Memories of a Color*.[53] British indie rock band Hefner released a single called \"Alan Bean\" in 2001, writing from the perspective of Bean during Apollo 12.[54] For her 2019 novel, *America Was Hard to Find*, American writer Kathleen Alcott based her description of the Apollo landing on interviews she conducted with Bean.[55]\n\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\n* *My Life As An Astronaut* (1989) ISBN\u00a0978-0671674250\n* *Apollo: An Eyewitness Account* (with Andrew Chaikin) (1998) ISBN\u00a0978-0867130508\n* *Into the Sunlit Splendor: The Aviation Art of William S.

During six successful two-man landing missions, twelve men walked on the lunar surface, six of whom drove Lunar Roving Vehicles as part of the last three missions. Three men have been to the Moon twice, one orbited once and took a circumlunar trajectory the second time, while the other two landed once apiece. Apart from these 24 men, no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit. No woman has been to the Moon, but a number of non-human animals have circled or orbited it, including two tortoises and five mice.\n\n\nApollo missions 8 and 10\u201317 were the nine crewed missions to the Moon. Apollo 4\u20136 and AS-201 and AS-202 were uncrewed, while AS-203 is considered a test flight. The Apollo program included three other crewed missions: Apollo 1 (AS-204) did not launch and its crew died in a ground-based capsule fire, while Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were low Earth orbit missions that only tested spacecraft components and docking maneuvers. Apollo missions 18, 19, and 20 were canceled. Nine astronauts later flew unused Apollo command modules in the Apollo Applications Program's Skylab and Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project. Of the twenty-four astronauts who flew to the Moon, two went on to command a Skylab mission, one commanded Apollo\u2013Soyuz, one flew as commander for Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle, and two commanded orbital Space Shuttle missions.\n\n\n\n\n## Prime crew members[edit]\n\n\nNASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations during the Gemini and Apollo programs was Donald K. \"Deke\" Slayton, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a minor cardiac arrhythmia \u2013 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments. In March 1972, Slayton was restored to flight status, and flew on the 1975 Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project mission.\n\n\nThe prime crew members selected for actual missions are here grouped by their NASA astronaut selection groups, and within each group in the order selected for flight. Two versions of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) spacecraft were developed: Block I, intended for preliminary low Earth orbit testing; and Block II, redesigned for the lunar landing. The Block I crew position titles were Command Pilot, Senior Pilot (second seat), and Pilot (third seat). The corresponding Block II titles were: Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot. The second seat pilot was given secondary responsibility for celestial navigation to keep the CSM's guidance computer accurately calibrated with the spacecraft's true position, and the third seat pilot served as a flight engineer, monitoring the health of the spacecraft systems.\n\n\n\n## Apollo astronauts by their dates of selection by NASA[edit]\n\n\n### 1959[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mercury Seven astronauts (L to R): Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Grissom, Schirra, Shepard, and Slayton\n* Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom began his career at NASA in 1959. In 1966, he was selected as Command Pilot for the first crewed Apollo mission, a low Earth orbit test. This mission ended a month before its scheduled launch,[1] when a cabin fire on the launch pad killed Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee on January 27, 1967.[2][3]\n* Walter M. Schirra Jr. also began his NASA career in 1959. He was selected in October 1968 as Command Pilot for Apollo 7, an 11-day, low Earth orbit shakedown test of the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module and the first crewed launch for the Apollo project.\n* Alan B. Shepard Jr. \u2013 America's first man in space on *Freedom 7* was originally selected to command Gemini 3, but was medically grounded for the duration of Gemini due to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and assisted Slayton in Flight Operations. After corrective surgery, Shepard was restored to flight status and commanded Apollo 14, the third successful Moon landing mission.\n\n\n### 1962[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NASA Astronaut Group 2\n\n![](image)NASA Astronaut Group 2: Back row: Elliot M. See (died in Gemini training), McDivitt, Lovell, White, Stafford. Front row: Conrad, Borman, Armstrong, Young\nAll of these astronauts flew on Gemini, and except for White, each commanded one Gemini and one Apollo mission:\n\n\n\n* Edward H. White II \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 4 who made the United States' first walk in space, selected as Senior Pilot (second seat) on Apollo 1. White was killed in the Apollo 1 fire along with Grissom and Chaffee.\n* James A. McDivitt \u2013 Commander of Gemini 4, selected in late 1966 to command the first Earth orbital flight test of the Apollo Lunar Module with the CSM. This mission flew in March 1969 as Apollo 9. After his flight, McDivitt was promoted to Manager of Lunar Landing Operations, and in August 1969 was promoted to Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program.\n* Frank F. Borman II \u2013 Commander of Gemini 7, selected to command a higher Earth orbit test of the complete Apollo spacecraft. But when delays prevented the LM from being ready in time for its first flight in December 1968, Borman's mission was changed to the first lunar orbital flight of the CSM on Apollo 8.\n* James A. Lovell Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 7, and commander of Gemini 12, flew as Command Module Pilot (second seat) on Apollo 8. Lovell became the first to fly a second Apollo mission as commander of Apollo 13, the third lunar landing attempt. This mission was unsuccessful, due to a Service Module electrical system failure caused by an oxygen tank explosion. Lovell and his crew managed to return to Earth safely. Lovell is the only person to fly to the Moon twice without landing there.\n* Thomas P. Stafford \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 6A and commander of Gemini 9A, commanded a lunar orbital test of the Lunar Module on Apollo 10. He also commanded the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project mission.\n* John W. Young \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 3 and commander of Gemini 10, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 10. Young later commanded the successful Apollo 16 lunar landing. He also commanded the first Space Shuttle flight, STS-1 *Columbia*, April 12\u201314, 1981, and STS-9, also on *Columbia*, November 28\u2013December 8, 1983.\n* Neil A. Armstrong \u2013 Commander of Gemini 8, commanded Apollo 11, becoming the first human to set foot on the Moon.\n* Charles \"Pete\" Conrad Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 5 and commander of Gemini 11, commanded Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. He went on to command Skylab 2, successfully completing repairs to the spacecraft that saved it for this and two subsequent missions.\n\n\n### 1963[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NASA Astronaut Group 3\n\n![](image)NASA Astronaut Group 3\nThis was the first class of astronauts for which test pilot experience was not required, but military jet fighter pilot experience was acceptable.\n\n\nFive of this group got their first spaceflight experience as second seat on Gemini:\n\n\n\n* David R. Scott \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 8, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 9, and commanded the Apollo 15 lunar landing.\n* Eugene A. Cernan \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 9A, flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 10, and commanded the final lunar landing mission Apollo 17.\n* Michael Collins \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 10, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 11.\n* Edwin E. \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 12, flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 11, the first Moon landing.\n* Richard F. Gordon Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 11, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 12. Gordon was selected to command the Apollo 18 lunar landing, which was later canceled.\n\n\nThe remaining six members of this group were selected for their first space flights on Apollo:\n\n\n\n* Roger B. Chaffee \u2013 Selected as Pilot (third seat) on Apollo 1, was killed with Grissom and White in the fire.\n* Donn F. Eisele \u2013 Flew second seat on Apollo 7.\n* R. Walter Cunningham \u2013 Flew third seat on Apollo 7.\n* Russell L. \"Rusty\" Schweickart \u2013 Flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 9. Schweickart performed an EVA outside the spacecraft, testing the portable life support system used on the Moon.\n* William A. Anders \u2013 Flew third seat on Apollo 8.\n* Alan L. Bean \u2013 Flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 12. He later served as commander for Skylab 3.\n\n\n### 1965[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NASA Astronaut Group 4\n\n![](image)Group 4 \u2013 the scientist astronaut group; Harrison Schmitt (center) became NASA's first scientist astronaut to fly in space.\nIn June 1965, NASA named a group of five scientist astronauts, the first group qualified by doctorate degrees rather than test or military fighter pilot experience.[nb 1] Geologist Harrison H. \"Jack\" Schmitt participated heavily in the geological training of the lunar landing astronauts, as well as assisting in the analysis of returned samples and the preparation of mission reports. In 1970, he was selected as Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 15 backup crew, and prime crew on Apollo 18. When program cutbacks canceled missions 18 through 20, NASA's lunar geological community insisted on having a geologist on the Moon, so Slayton reassigned Schmitt to Apollo 17.\n\n\n\n### 1966[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NASA Astronaut Group 5\n\n![](image)NASA Astronaut Group 5\nNASA named a group of 19 more astronauts in April 1966. None had spaceflight experience before their Apollo mission.\n\n\n\n* T. Kenneth Mattingly II \u2013 Selected as prime Command Module Pilot for Apollo 13, Mattingly was exposed to German measles days before the flight and was grounded by the flight surgeon, though ultimately did not contract the disease. He swapped places with his backup and flew on Apollo 16. He also flew on STS-4 and STS-51-C\n* John L. \"Jack\" Swigert Jr. \u2013 Flew as Mattingly's backup on Apollo 13.\n* Fred W. Haise Jr. \u2013 Flew as Lunar Module Pilot on the unsuccessful Apollo 13. Haise was selected to command the Apollo 19 lunar landing, which was canceled. Haise would later be named commander of the first crew for the Space Shuttle's Approach and Landing Tests using the prototype Space Shuttle *Enterprise*.\n* Stuart A. Roosa \u2013 Command Module Pilot on Apollo 14\n* Edgar D. Mitchell \u2013 Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 14\n* Alfred M. Worden \u2013 Command Module Pilot on Apollo 15\n* James B. Irwin \u2013 Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 15\n* Charles M. Duke Jr. \u2013 First achieved public recognition as capsule communicator during the Apollo 11 Moon landing; notable for the quote: \"...we copy you on the ground. You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue; we're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"[4] Duke flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 16.\n* Ronald E. Evans Jr. \u2013 Command Module Pilot on Apollo 17.\n\n\n## Astronauts who trained for Apollo but did not fly[edit]\n\n\n* L. Gordon Cooper Jr. \u2013 from the Mercury Seven; veteran of Mercury *Faith 7* and commander of Gemini 5, was replaced as Apollo 14 commander by Alan Shepard and resigned from NASA in 1970.\n* Clifton C. \"C.C.\" Williams Jr. \u2013 from Group 3; was named as Schweickart's Lunar Module Pilot backup crew, but was killed when the T-38 jet he was flying crashed near Tallahassee, Florida on October 5, 1967. He was replaced by Bean, who flew on Apollo 12.\n* Vance D. Brand \u2013 from Group 5; was on the support crew for Apollo 8 and Apollo 13; was named as Apollo 15 backup Command Module Pilot. Flew on the 1975 Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project (not a flight of the Apollo program). He also flew as commander of STS-5, STS-41-B and STS-35.\n* Edward G. Givens Jr. \u2013 from Group 5; was on the support crew of Apollo 7, but died in a car crash near Houston, Texas on June 6, 1967.\n* Joe H. Engle \u2013 from Group 5; was originally named as Apollo 17 Lunar Module Pilot, but lost his slot to Schmitt. After Apollo, he flew in the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests, then commanded STS-2 and STS-51-I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon[edit]\n\n\nTwelve men walked on the Moon during six Moon landings of the Apollo program between July 1969 and December 1972. All landed on the surface only once, and five missions consisted of two or more surface EVAs. Four of them are alive as of January\u00a02023.[update] Most astronauts at that time came from the military services and were considered to be on active duty during their NASA service. The few exceptions were considered civilian NASA astronauts, regardless of any prior military service.\n\n\nOn the last of their three Apollo 17 extravehicular activities (EVAs), Harrison Schmitt stepped out of the Apollo lunar module onto the surface of the Moon after Gene Cernan, and is therefore the 12th and most recent person to have stepped out onto the Moon. When they re-entered the lunar module Cernan stepped in last, and is therefore (at present) the last person to have walked on the Moon.\n\n\nAlan Shepard was the oldest person to walk on the Moon, at age 47 years and 80 days. Charles Duke was the youngest, at age 36 years and 201 days.\n\n\nJim Lovell and Fred Haise were scheduled to walk on the Moon during the Apollo 13 mission, but the lunar landing was aborted following an explosion in the spacecraft service module en route to the Moon. Haise was again scheduled to walk on the Moon as commander of Apollo 19, but Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were canceled on September 2, 1970.\n\n\nJoe Engle had trained on the backup crew for Apollo 14 to explore the Moon with Cernan, but he was replaced by Schmitt on the primary crew for Apollo 17. Schmitt had previously been crewed with Apollo 12 Command Module pilot Dick Gordon in anticipation of Apollo 18, but Schmitt replaced Engle on Apollo 17 after the cancellation of Apollo 18 and Apollo 19, leaving Gordon as the last Apollo astronaut to train extensively for lunar exploration without ever landing on the Moon.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Portrait\n | Name and group\n | Born\n | Died\n | Age atfirst step\n | Mission\n | Lunar Module Landing Time (UTC)[5] | Lunar Module Ascent Time (UTC)[5] | Elapsed Time on Lunar Surface\n | Lunar EVAs[5] | Total EVA Duration[5] | Military service\n | Alma mater\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Neil Armstrong**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) | (1930-08-05)August 5, 1930 | August 25, 2012(2012-08-25) (aged\u00a082) | 38y 11m 15d\n | Apollo 11 | July 20, 1969 at 8:17 PM\n | July 21, 1969 at 5:54 PM\n | 21 hours 37 minutes | 1\n | 2 hours 31 minutes | Civilian[nb 2] (Navy veteran) | Purdue University, University of Southern California |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Buzz Aldrin**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) |  (1930-01-20) January 20, 1930 (age\u00a094) |  | 39y 6m 0d\n | 1\n | 2 hours 31 minutes | Air Force | United States Military Academy, MIT |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Pete Conrad**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) | (1930-06-02)June 2, 1930 | July 8, 1999(1999-07-08) (aged\u00a069) | 39y 5m 17d\n | Apollo 12 | November 19, 1969 at 6:54 AM\n | November 20, 1969 at 2:25 PM\n | 1 day 7 hours 31 minutes\n | 2\n | 7 hours 45 minutes | Navy | Princeton University |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Alan Bean**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) | (1932-03-15)March 15, 1932 | May 26, 2018(2018-05-26) (aged\u00a086) | 37y 8m 4d\n | 2\n | 7 hours 45 minutes | Navy | University of Texas, Austin |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Alan Shepard**(Mercury Seven) | (1923-11-18)November 18, 1923 | July 21, 1998(1998-07-21) (aged\u00a074) | 47y 2m 18d\n | Apollo 14 | February 5, 1971 at 9:18 AM\n | February 6, 1971 at 6:48 PM\n | 1 day 9 hours 30 minutes\n | 2\n | 9 hours 22 minutes | Navy | United States Naval Academy, Naval War College |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Edgar Mitchell**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1930-09-17)September 17, 1930 | February 4, 2016(2016-02-04) (aged\u00a085) | 40y 4m 19d\n | 2\n | 9 hours 22 minutes | Navy | Carnegie Mellon University, Naval Postgraduate School, MIT |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **David Scott**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) |  (1932-06-06) June 6, 1932 (age\u00a092) |  | 39y 1m 25d\n | Apollo 15 | July 30, 1971 at 10:16 PM\n | August 2, 1971 at 5:11 PM\n | 2 days 18 hours 55 minutes\n | 3\n | 18 hours 34 minutes | Air Force | University of Michigan, United States Military Academy, MIT |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **James Irwin**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1930-03-17)March 17, 1930 | August 8, 1991(1991-08-08) (aged\u00a061) | 41y 4m 14d\n | 3\n | 18 hours 34 minutes | Air Force | United States Naval Academy, University of Michigan |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **John Young**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) | (1930-09-24)September 24, 1930 | January 5, 2018(2018-01-05) (aged\u00a087) | 41y 6m 28d\n | Apollo 16 | April 21, 1972 at 2:23 AM\n | April 24, 1972 at 1:25 AM\n | 2 days 23 hours 2 minutes\n | 3\n | 20 hours 14 minutes | Navy | Georgia Institute of Technology |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | **Charles Duke**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) |  (1935-10-03) October 3, 1935 (age\u00a088) |  | 36y 6m 18d\n | 3\n | 20 hours 14 minutes | Air Force | United States Naval Academy, MIT |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | **Eugene Cernan**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) | (1934-03-14)March 14, 1934 | January 16, 2017(2017-01-16) (aged\u00a082) | 38y 9m 7d\n | Apollo 17 | December 11, 1972 at 7:54 PM\n | December 14, 1972 at 10:54 PM\n | 3 days 3 hours 0 minutes\n | 3\n | 22 hours 3 minutes | Navy | Purdue University, Naval Postgraduate School |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | **Harrison Schmitt**(NASA Astronaut Group 4) |  (1935-07-03) July 3, 1935 (age\u00a088) |  | 37y 5m 8d\n | 3\n | 22 hours 3 minutes | Civilian[nb 3] | Caltech, University of Oslo, Harvard University |\n\n\n## Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing[edit]\n\n\nBesides the 12 people who have walked on the Moon, 12 more have flown to within 0.001 lunar distance of its surface. During each of the six missions with successful lunar landings, one astronaut remained in lunar orbit while the other two landed. In addition, the three-person crews of Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 also entered lunar orbit, and the crew of Apollo 13 looped around the Moon on a free-return trajectory.\n\n\nAll nine crewed missions to the Moon took place as part of the Apollo program over a period of just under four years, from 21 December 1968 to 19 December 1972. The 24 people who have flown to the Moon are the only people who have traveled beyond low Earth orbit. Eight of them are alive with an average age of 91.9\nyears.\n\n\nJim Lovell, John Young, and Eugene Cernan are the only three people to have flown to the Moon twice. Young and Cernan each set foot on it during their respective second lunar missions, while Lovell is the only person to have flown to the Moon twice without landing.\n\n\nDuring Cernan's first lunar mission on Apollo 10, he tied the present record set by Bill Anders on Apollo 8 as the youngest person to fly to the Moon. Each was 35 years and 65 days old on his launch date and 35 years and 68 days old when he entered lunar orbit. The oldest person to fly to the Moon was Alan Shepard, who walked on its surface during the Apollo 14 mission. Shepard was 47 years and 74 days old on his launch date and 47 years and 78 days old when he entered lunar orbit.\n\n\nJim Lovell and Fred Haise were scheduled to walk on the Moon during the Apollo 13 mission, but the lunar landing was aborted following a major malfunction en route to the Moon.[6] Haise was again scheduled to walk on the Moon as commander of Apollo 19, but Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were canceled on September 2, 1970. Because of Apollo 13's free-return trajectory, Lovell, Swigert and Haise flew higher above the Moon's 180\u00b0 meridian (opposite Earth) than anyone else has flown (254\u00a0km/158\u00a0mi). Coincidentally, due to the Moon's distance from Earth at the time, they simultaneously set the present record for humans' greatest distance from Earth, reaching an altitude of 400,171\u00a0km (248,655\u00a0mi) above sea level at 0:21 UTC on 15 April 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Portrait\n | Name and group\n | Born\n | Died\n | Age\n | Mission\n | Military service\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Frank Borman**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) | (1928-03-14)March 14, 1928 | November 7, 2023(2023-11-07) (aged\u00a095) | 40 | Apollo 8  December 21\u201327, 1968 | Air Force |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Jim Lovell**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) |  (1928-03-25) March 25, 1928 (age\u00a096) |  | 4042 | Apollo 8  December 21\u201327, 1968 Apollo 13  April 11\u201317, 1970 | Navy | Intended to land on Apollo 13; only person to fly to the Moon twice without landing.\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Bill Anders**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) |  (1933-10-17) October 17, 1933 (age\u00a090) |  | 35 | Apollo 8  December 21\u201327, 1968 | Air Force |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Tom Stafford**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) |  (1930-09-17) September 17, 1930 (age\u00a093) |  | 38 | Apollo 10  May 18\u201326, 1969 | Air Force | Later flew on Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project.\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Michael Collins**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) | (1930-10-31)October 31, 1930 | April 28, 2021(2021-04-28) (aged\u00a090) | 38 | Apollo 11  July 16\u201324, 1969 | Air Force |  |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Dick Gordon**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) | (1929-10-05)October 5, 1929 | November 6, 2017(2017-11-06) (aged\u00a088) | 40 | Apollo 12  November 14\u201324, 1969 | Navy | Trained to land, slated for Apollo 18 (canceled).[7] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Jack Swigert**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1931-08-30)August 30, 1931 | December 27, 1982(1982-12-27) (aged\u00a051) | 38 | Apollo 13  April 11\u201317, 1970 | Air Force |  |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Fred Haise**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) |  (1933-11-14) November 14, 1933 (age\u00a090) |  | 36 | Apollo 13  April 11\u201317, 1970 | Marines, Air Force | Intended to land; later trained to land and slated to command Apollo 19 (canceled);[7] flew the Space Shuttle on approach / landing tests.\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Stu Roosa**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1933-08-16)August 16, 1933 | December 12, 1994(1994-12-12) (aged\u00a061) | 37 | Apollo 14  January 31 \u2013 February 9, 1971 | Air Force | In rotation to land on Apollo 20 (canceled).\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | **Al Worden**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1932-02-07)February 7, 1932 | March 18, 2020(2020-03-18) (aged\u00a088) | 39 | Apollo 15  July 26 \u2013 August 7, 1971 | Air Force |  |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | **Ken Mattingly**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1936-03-17)March 17, 1936 | October 31, 2023(2023-10-31) (aged\u00a087) | 36 | Apollo 16  April 16\u201327, 1972 | Navy | Later flew two Space Shuttle missions.\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | **Ron Evans**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) | (1933-11-10)November 10, 1933 | April 7, 1990(1990-04-07) (aged\u00a056) | 39 | Apollo 17  December 7\u201319, 1972 | Navy |  |\n\n\n## Lunar activities[edit]\n\n\nArmstrong descended the lunar module ladder and spoke his famous epigram, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[8] He then went to work on collecting the contingency sample, which was a scoop of the lunar surface collected early in the mission in case there was an emergency.[9] Armstrong took the TV camera off the lunar module and mounted it to a tripod.[10] After that, Aldrin descended the ladder to join Armstrong.[11] Aldrin egressed to the surface about nineteen minutes after Armstrong.[12] They had some trouble planting the American flag into the lunar soil, but were able to secure it into the surface. Aldrin positioned himself in front of a video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion techniques on the surface.[13] During these experiments, Armstrong and Aldrin received a phone call from President Nixon, congratulating them for the successful landing.[14]\n\n\nAldrin then set to work documenting the condition of the spacecraft to ensure it was in proper condition for their upcoming launch. After setting up a couple of experiments with Armstrong, Aldrin went to work hammering a tube into the lunar surface to obtain a core sample.[15] Aldrin's EVA ended when they loaded the lunar samples into the spacecraft and tossed out unneeded items, just before sealing the hatch.[10] Armstrong performed the majority of the photography on the surface, which is why there are only five photos of him on the Moon.[16]\n\n\nSoon after piloting the LM *Falcon* to a landing at Hadley Rille, Scott accomplished the only stand-up EVA through the lander's top hatch, using it as a high place from which to refine the geology traverses he and Irwin would undertake during the following days. Scott became the first to drive a vehicle on the Moon as he drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle, more than doubling Apollo 14's EVA time. After the final traverse, back outside the LM, Scott performed a demonstration of Galileo's theory that all objects fall at the same rate in vacuum by dropping a hammer and a feather for the television camera.\n\n\nIrwin came onto the lunar surface soon after his commander, Scott. As the LRV's first passenger, he had an often rough ride as Scott swerved to avoid craters.[17] It was Irwin who, during the second EVA, first spotted the Genesis Rock and aided Scott in collecting this bit of the early lunar crust.[18] A man of deep Christian religious faith, Irwin quoted from Psalms while on the lunar surface and later became an evangelist.[19]\n\n\n\n## Apollo astronauts who never flew to the Moon[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the nine lunar missions, there were two crewed flights in the Apollo program that remained in Earth orbit to test fly the spacecraft. Apollo 7 was a crewed test flight of the CSM, and Apollo 9 was a crewed flight test of the CSM and LEM. Of the six astronauts who participated in these missions, five were never rotated to a lunar mission. In addition, the three Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project used crewed CSMs in Earth orbit and are considered part of the Apollo Applications Project. Although Conrad, Bean, and Stafford commanded three of these four flights, the remaining crew members were rookies and thus had long missed the opportunity to fly a Moon mission. Of the seven rookies who flew Skylab, three of them (Paul J. Weitz, Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma) would return to space aboard the Space Shuttle. Vance Brand flew on ASTP as Command Module Pilot and would command three Shuttle missions. Except for Garriott, all Apollo astronauts who also flew on the Shuttle served as commander.\n\n\n\n* Walter M. Schirra Jr. \u2013 Commander of Apollo 7.\n* Donn F.

The crew circled the Moon and were returned safely to Earth using the LM *Aquarius* as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Uncrewed test flights[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1961 through 1967, Saturn launch vehicles and Apollo spacecraft components were tested in uncrewed flights.\n\n\n\n### Saturn I[edit]\n\n\nThe Saturn I launch vehicle was originally planned to carry crewed Command Module flights into low Earth orbit, but its 20,000-pound (9,100\u00a0kg) payload capacity limit could not lift even a partially fueled Service Module, which would have required building a lightweight retrorocket module for deorbit. These plans were eventually scrapped, in favor of using the uprated Saturn IB to launch the Command Module with a half-fueled Service Module for crewed Earth orbit tests. This limited Saturn I flights to Saturn launch vehicle development, CSM boilerplate testing, and three micrometeroid satellite launches in support of Apollo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | LV\u00a0Serial\u00a0No | Launch\n | Remarks\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SA-1 | Saturn I\nSA-1\n | October 27, 1961\n15:06 GMT\nLaunch Complex 34\n | Test of Saturn I first stage S-I; dummy upper stages carried water\n | [1][8][9] |\n| SA-2 | Saturn I\nSA-2\n | April 25, 1962\n14:00 GMT\nLaunch Complex 34\n | Dummy upper stages released 22,900 U.S. gallons (86,685\u00a0L) of water into upper atmosphere, to investigate effects on radio transmission and changes in local weather conditions\n | [1][8][9] |\n| SA-3 | Saturn I\nSA-3\n | November 16, 1962\n17:45 GMT\nLaunch Complex 34\n | Repeat of SA-2 mission\n | [1][8][9] |\n| SA-4 | Saturn I\nSA-4\n | March 28, 1963\n20:11 GMT\nLaunch Complex 34\n | Test premature shutdown of a single S-I engine\n | [1][8][9] |\n| SA-5 | Saturn I\nSA-5\n | January 29, 1964\n16:25 GMT\nLaunch Complex 37B\n | First flight of live second stage.

This is due to AS-204 being renamed to Apollo 1 posthumously. This crewed flight was to have followed the first three uncrewed flights. After the fire which killed the AS-204 crew on the pad during a test and training exercise, uncrewed Apollo flights resumed to test the Saturn V launch vehicle and the Lunar Module; these were designated Apollo 4, 5 and 6. The first crewed Apollo mission was thus Apollo 7. Simple \"Apollo\" numbers were never assigned to the first three uncrewed flights, although renaming AS-201, AS-202, and AS-203 as Apollo 1-A, Apollo 2 and Apollo 3, had been briefly considered.[6]\n\n\n\n### Saturn IB[edit]\n\n\nThe Saturn I was converted to the Uprated Saturn I, eventually designated Saturn IB, by replacing the S-IV second stage with the S-IVB, which would also be used as the third stage of the Saturn V with the addition of on-orbit restart capability. This increased the payload capacity to 46,000 pounds (21,000\u00a0kg), enough to orbit a Command Module with a half-fueled Service Module, and more than enough to orbit a fully fueled Lunar Module.\n\n\nTwo suborbital tests of the Apollo Block I Command and Service Module, one S-IVB development test, and one Lunar Module test were conducted. Success of the LM test led to cancellation of a planned second uncrewed flight.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | LV\u00a0Serial\u00a0No | Launch\n | Remarks\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AS-201 | Saturn IB\nSA-201\n | February 26, 1966\n16:12 GMT\nLaunch Complex 34\n | First test of Saturn IB and Block I Apollo CSM.

These included simulated \"pad aborts\", which might occur while the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle was still on the launch pad, and flights on the Little Joe II rocket to simulate Mode I aborts which might occur while the vehicle was in the air.[1]\n\n\n\n![Pad Abort Test number 2.

But Mueller introduced the \"all-up\" testing philosophy of using three live stages plus the Apollo spacecraft on every test flight. This achieved development of the Saturn V with far fewer uncrewed tests, and facilitated achieving the Moon landing by the 1969 goal. The size of the Saturn V production lot was reduced from 20 to 15 units.[10]\n\n\nThree uncrewed test flights were planned to human-rate the super heavy-lift Saturn V which would take crewed Apollo flights to the Moon. Success of the first flight and qualified success of the second led to the decision to cancel the third uncrewed test.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | LV\u00a0Serial\u00a0No | Launch\n | Remarks\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apollo 4 | Saturn V\nSA-501\n | November 9, 1967\n12:00 GMT\nLaunch Complex 39A\n | First flight of Saturn V rocket; successfully demonstrated S-IVB third stage restart and tested CM heat shield at lunar re-entry speeds.\n | [1][8][9] |\n| Apollo 6 | Saturn V\nSA-502\n | April 4, 1968\n16:12 GMT\nLaunch Complex 39A\n | Second flight of Saturn V; severe \"pogo\" vibrations caused two second-stage engines to shut down prematurely, and third stage restart to fail. SM engine used to achieve high-speed re-entry, though less than Apollo 4. NASA identified vibration fixes and declared Saturn V man-rated.\n | [1][8][9] |\n\n\n## Alphabetical mission types[edit]\n\n\nThe Apollo program required sequential testing of several major mission elements in the runup to a crewed lunar landing. An alphabetical list of major mission types was proposed by Owen Maynard in September 1967.[11][12] Two \"A-type\" missions performed uncrewed tests of the CSM and the Saturn V, and one B-type mission performed an uncrewed test of the LM. The C-type mission, the first crewed flight of the CSM in Earth orbit, was performed by Apollo 7.\n\n\nThe list was revised upon George Low's proposal to commit a mission to lunar orbit ahead of schedule, an idea influenced by the status of the CSM as a proven craft and production delays of the LM.[13] Apollo 8 was reclassified from its original assignment as a D-type mission, a test of the complete CSM/LM spacecraft in Earth orbit, to a \"C-prime\" mission which would fly humans to the Moon. Once complete, it obviated the need for the E-type objective of a medium Earth orbital test. The D-type mission was instead performed by Apollo 9; the F-type mission, Apollo 10, flew the CSM/LM spacecraft to the Moon for final testing, without landing. The G-type mission, Apollo 11, performed the first lunar landing, the central goal of the program.\n\n\nThe initial A\u2013G[11][14] list was expanded to include later mission types:[1]:\u200a466 H-type missions\u2014Apollo 12, 13 (planned) and 14\u2014would perform precision landings, and J-type missions\u2014Apollo 15, 16 and 17\u2014would perform thorough scientific investigation. The I-type objective, which called for extended lunar orbital surveillance of the Moon,[15] was incorporated into the J-type missions.[1]:\u200a466\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabetical mission types of the Apollo Program\n| Mission type\n | Missions\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A\n | * Apollo 4\n* Apollo 6\n | \"Unmanned flights of launch vehicles and the CSM, to demonstrate the adequacy of their design and to certify safety for men.\"[14][a] |\n| B\n | Apollo 5 | \"Unmanned flight of the LM, to demonstrate the adequacy of its design and to certify its safety for men.\"[14] |\n| C\n | Apollo 7 | \"Manned flight to demonstrate performance and operability of the CSM.\"[14] |\n| C\u2032\n | Apollo 8 | \"Command and service module manned flight demonstration in lunar orbit.\"[1]:\u200a466 |\n| D\n | Apollo 9 | \"Manned flight of the complete lunar landing mission vehicle in low Earth orbit to demonstrate operability of all the equipment and (insofar as could be done in Earth orbit) to perform the maneuvers involved in the ultimate mission.\"[14] |\n| E\n | \u2014\n | \"Manned flight of the complete lunar landing mission vehicle in Earth orbit to great distances from Earth.\"[14] |\n| F\n | Apollo 10 | \"A complete mission except for the final descent to and landing on the lunar surface.\"[14] |\n| G\n | Apollo 11 | \"The initial lunar landing mission.\"[14] |\n| H\n | * Apollo 12\n* Apollo 13 (planned)\n* Apollo 14\n | \"Precision manned lunar landing demonstration and systematic lunar exploration.\"[1]:\u200a466 |\n| I\n | \u2014\n | \"Reserved for lunar survey missions.\" (Not used)[15] |\n| J\n | * Apollo 15\n* Apollo 16\n* Apollo 17\n | \"Extensive scientific investigation of Moon on lunar surface and from lunar orbit.\"[1]:\u200a466 |\n\n\n## Crewed missions[edit]\n\n\nThe Block I CSM spacecraft did not have capability to fly with the LM, and the three crew positions were designated Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot, based on U.S. Air Force pilot ratings. The Block II spacecraft was designed to fly with the Lunar Module, so the corresponding crew positions were designated Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot regardless of whether a Lunar Module was present or not on any mission.[16]\n\n\nSeven of the missions involved extravehicular activity (EVA), spacewalks or moonwalks outside of the spacecraft. These were of three types: testing the lunar EVA suit in Earth orbit (Apollo 9), exploring the lunar surface, and retrieving film canisters from the Scientific Instrument Module stored in the Service Module.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Patch\n | Launch date\n | Crew\n | Launch vehicle[b] | CM name\n | LM name\n | Duration\n | Remarks\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apollo 1 | ![Apollo 1 mission patch](image) | February 21, 1967\nLaunch Complex 34 (planned)\n | Gus GrissomEd WhiteRoger B.

First, Apollo 20 was cut to make a Saturn V available to launch the Skylab space station whole instead of building it on-orbit using multiple Saturn IB launches.[45] Eight months later, Apollo 18 and 19 were also cut to further economize, and because of fears of increased chance of failure with a large number of lunar flights.[46][47]\n\n\n\n\n| As planned | As flown\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mission | Type | Date | Landing site | CDR | CMP | LMP\n | Mission | Launch date | Landing site | CDR | CMP | LMP\n |\n| Apollo 12 | H | November 1969 | Ocean of Storms | Pete Conrad | Richard F.

In 1961, he became the second person and the first American to travel into space and, in 1971, he became the fifth and oldest person to walk on the Moon, at age 47.\n\n\nA graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II. He became a naval aviator in 1947, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected as one of the original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first crewed Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named *Freedom 7*. His craft entered space, but was not capable of achieving orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B *Freedom 7 II* in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was canceled.\n\n\nShepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed Project Gemini mission, but was grounded in October 1963 due to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1968, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission, piloting the Apollo Lunar Module *Antares*. He was the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to walk on the Moon. During the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface.\n\n\nShepard was Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to August 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until April 30, 1974. On August 25, 1971, he was promoted to rear admiral, the first astronaut to reach that rank. He retired from the United States Navy and NASA on July 31, 1974.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAlan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on November 18, 1923, at 64 Hampstead Road[1] in Derry, New Hampshire,[2] to Alan Bartlett Shepard Sr. and Pauline Renza Shepard (n\u00e9e\u00a0Emerson).[3] He had a younger sister, Pauline, who was known as Polly.[4] The two were descendants of *Mayflower* passenger Richard Warren, [3] and were related to Scottish emigrants from Berneray in the Outer Hebrides, through the Shepard line.[5] Alan Bartlett Shepard Sr., known as Bart, worked in the Derry National Bank, owned by Shepard's grandfather. Bart joined the National Guard in 1915 and served in France with the American Expeditionary Force during World War I.[6] He remained in the National Guard between the wars, and was recalled to active duty during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.[7]\n\n\nShepard attended Adams School in Derry, where his academic performance impressed his teachers. He skipped the sixth grade[8] and proceeded to middle school at Oak Street School in Derry,[7] where he also skipped the eighth grade.[8] He achieved the Boy Scouts of America rank of First Class Scout.[9] In 1936, he went to the Pinkerton Academy, a private school in Derry that his father had attended and where his grandfather had been a trustee.[10] He completed grades 9 to 12 there.[8] Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the academy and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a Douglas DC-3.[11] The following year he began cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would do odd jobs in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.[12][13]\n\n\nShepard graduated from Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940 but at sixteen was too young to enter that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy from which he graduated with the Class of 1941.[14] Tests administered at Farragut indicated an IQ of 145 but his grades were mediocre.[15]\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Shepard enjoyed aquatic sports. He was a keen and competitive sailor, winning several races, including a regatta held by the Annapolis Yacht Club. He learned to sail all the types of boats the academy owned, up to and including USS\u00a0*Freedom*, a 90-foot (27\u00a0m) schooner. He also participated in swimming and rowed with the eight.[15] During his Christmas break in 1942, he went to Principia College to be with his sister, who was unable to go home owing to wartime travel restrictions. There he met Louise Brewer, whose parents were pensioners on the du Pont family estate and like Renza Shepard, were devout Christian Scientists.[16][17] Owing to the war, the usual four-year course at Annapolis was cut short by a year. He graduated with the Class of 1945 on June 6, 1944, ranked 463rd out of 915, and was commissioned as an ensign and awarded a Bachelor of Science degree. The following month he became secretly engaged to Louise.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Naval service[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Shepard quoted at the New Mexico Museum of Space History[20]\n\nAfter a month of classroom instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, USS\u00a0*Cogswell*, in August 1944;[21] it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea.[12] At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30.[22] After just two days at sea *Cogswell* helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser USS\u00a0*Reno*, which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers went down, and battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.[23]\n\n\n\n![A ship plows through the water. It has two guns forward, and two aft.](image)USS\u00a0*Cogswell* in 1945\n*Cogswell* returned to the United States for an overhaul in February 1945. Shepard was given three weeks' leave, in which time he and Louise decided to marry. The ceremony took place on March 3, 1945, in St. Stephen's Lutheran Church in Wilmington, Delaware. His father, Bart, served as his best man. The newlyweds had only a brief time together before Shepard rejoined *Cogswell* at the Long Beach Navy Yard on April 5, 1945.[24] After the war, they had two children, both daughters: Laura, born in 1947,[25] and Julie, born in 1951.[26] Following the death of Louise's sister in 1956, they raised her five-year-old niece, Judith Williams\u2014whom they renamed Alice to avoid confusion with Julie\u2014as their own, although they never adopted her.[27][28] They eventually had six grandchildren.[29]\n\n\nOn Shepard's second cruise with *Cogswell*, he was appointed a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20\u00a0mm and 40\u00a0mm antiaircraft guns on the ship's bow. They engaged kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a radar picket. The job of the radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes, but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. *Cogswell* performed this duty from May 27 until June 26, 1945, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship also participated in the Allied naval bombardments of Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.[22][30]\n\n\n\n![Shepard, in Navy uniform short and tie, stands before a blackboard on which is stencilled \"Student aviator USN \u2013 8-19-1946 class. Above that is written in chalk: \"Lt (jg) Shepard, Alan B. Jr\"](image)Shepard as a student aviator in 1946\nIn November 1945, Shepard arrived at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, where he commenced basic flight training on January 7, 1946.[31] He was an average student, and for a time faced being \"bilged\" (dropped) from flight training and reassigned to the surface navy. To make up for this, he took private lessons at a local civilian flying school\u2014something the Navy frowned on\u2014earning a civil pilot's license.[32] His flying skills gradually improved, and by early 1947 his instructors rated him above average. He was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for advanced training. His final test was six perfect landings on the carrier USS\u00a0*Saipan*. The following day, he received his naval aviator wings, which his father pinned on his chest.[33]\n\n\nShepard was assigned to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Franklin D. Roosevelt*, but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, and in the meantime the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on *Franklin D. Roosevelt* with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those who were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.[34]\n\n\nNormally sea duty alternated with periods of duty ashore. In 1950, Shepard was selected to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland with class five, graduating in January 1951.[35][36] As a test pilot he conducted high-altitude tests to obtain information about the light and air masses at different altitudes over North America; carrier suitability certification of the McDonnell F2H Banshee; experiments with the Navy's new in-flight refueling system; and tests of the angled flight deck.[19] He narrowly avoided being court-martialed by the station commander, Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride, after looping the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and making low passes over the beach at Ocean City, Maryland, and the base; but Shepard's superiors, John Hyland and Robert M. Elder, interceded on his behalf.[37]\n\n\n\n![A Corsair on deck. A man stands nearby with fist upraised, giving a signal. There is another Corsair in the air above.](image)Shepard's 105th F4U sortie on USS\u00a0*Franklin D. Roosevelt*\nShepard's next assignment was to VF-193, a night fighter squadron flying the Banshee, that was based at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California. The squadron was part of Commander James D. \"Jig Dog\" Ramage's Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard's assignment on the advice of Elder, who commanded VF-193's sister squadron, VF-191. Ramage made Shepard his own wingman,[38] a decision that would save Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard talked him through a landing.[39] As squadron operations officer, Shepard's most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive. He served two tours on the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Oriskany* in the western Pacific. It set out on a combat tour off Korea in 1953, during the Korean War, but the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the fighting in July 1953, and Shepard did not see combat.[40]\n\n\nRear Admiral John P. Whitney requested Shepard's services as an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent.[41] He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger.[42] The Vought F7U Cutlass tended to go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable to break out of the spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy canceled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. He managed to restart the engine and avoid a fatal crash.[43]\n\n\nShepard was an instructor at the Test Pilot School, and then entered the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island.[44] He graduated in 1957, and became an Aircraft Readiness Officer on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet.[45] By this time he had logged more than 3,600 hours of flying time, including 1,700 hours in jets.[46]\n\n\n\n\n## NASA career[edit]\n\n\n### Mercury Seven[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mercury Seven\n\n![The astronauts pose in front of a delta-winged light blue-gray jet aircraft, holding their flight helmets under their arms. The three Navy aviators wear orange flight suits; the Air Force and Marine ones are green.](image)The Mercury Seven astronauts with a USAF F-106. From left to right: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan B. Shepard and Deke Slayton.\nOn October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury,[47] which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.[48]\n\n\nNASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first astronauts from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the United States Department of Defense. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards:[49] the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent and to be 5\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (1.80\u00a0m) or less. While these were not all strictly enforced, the height requirement was firm, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft.[50] The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.[51]\n\n\nThe first group of 35, which included Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.[52][53]\n\n\nThe briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.[54] Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory.[55] Only one candidate, Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;[56] thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.[56]\n\n\nShepard was informed of his selection on April 1, 1959. Two days later he traveled to Boston with Louise for the wedding of his cousin Anne, and was able to break the news to his parents and sister.[57][58] The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:[59] Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.[60] The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: \"Well, I'm glad they got that out of the way.\"[61]\n\n\n\n### *Freedom 7*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mercury-Redstone 3\n\n![Shepard in his Mercury space suit and helmet, with tubes connected.](image)Shepard in the *Freedom 7* capsule before launch\nFaced with intense competition from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog.[62] On January 19, 1961, Gilruth informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American crewed mission into space.[63] Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: \"Who let a Russian in here?\"[64] During training he flew 120 simulated flights.[65] Although this flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960,[66] it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961,[67] March 6, 1961,[68] April 25, 1961,[69] May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961.[70] On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth.[71] It was another body blow to American pride.[68] When Shepard heard the news he slammed his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relations officer feared he might have broken his hand.[72]\n\n\nOn May 5, 1961, Shepard piloted the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission and became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space.[73] He named his spacecraft, Mercury Spacecraft 7, *Freedom 7*.[68] He awoke at 01:10, and had breakfast consisting of orange juice, a filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and scrambled eggs with his backup, John Glenn, and flight surgeon William K. Douglas. He was helped into his space suit by suit technician Joseph W. Schmitt, and boarded the transfer van at 03:55. He ascended the gantry at 05:15, and entered the spacecraft five minutes later. It was expected that liftoff would occur in another two hours and five minutes,[74] so Shepard's suit did not have any provision for elimination of bodily wastes, but after being strapped into the capsule's seat, launch delays kept him in that suit for over four hours.[75] Shepard's endurance gave out before launch, and he was forced to empty his bladder into the suit. Medical sensors attached to it to track the astronaut's condition in flight were turned off to avoid shorting them out. The urine pooled in the small of his back, where it was absorbed by his undergarment.[76][77] After Shepard's flight, the space suit was modified, and by the time of Gus Grissom's Mercury-Redstone 4 suborbital flight in July, a liquid waste collection feature had been built into the suit.[78]\n\n\nUnlike Gagarin's 108-minute orbital flight in a Vostok spacecraft three times the size of *Freedom 7*,[71] Shepard stayed on a suborbital trajectory for the 15-minute flight, which reached an altitude of 101.2 nautical miles (116.5 statute miles; 187.4 kilometers), and then fell to a splashdown 263.1 nautical miles (302.8 statute miles; 487.3 kilometers) down the Atlantic Missile Range.[79] Unlike Gagarin, whose flight was strictly automatic, Shepard had some control of *Freedom 7*, spacecraft attitude in particular.[80] Shepard's launch was seen live on television by millions.[81] It was launched atop a Redstone rocket. According to Gene Kranz in his 2000 book *Failure Is Not an Option*, \"When reporters asked Shepard what he thought about as he sat atop the Redstone rocket, waiting for liftoff, he had replied, 'The fact that every part of this ship was built by the lowest bidder.'\"[82]\n\n\n\n![A green helicopter hovers low over the water, with the Mercury capsule suspended below. The helicopter has \"Marines\" written on it, and the number \"44\"](image)Marine Corps HUS-1 helicopter from HMR-262 retrieves *Freedom 7* from the Atlantic.\nAfter a dramatic Atlantic Ocean recovery, Shepard observed that he \"didn't really feel the flight was a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop.\"[83] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and the capsule was lifted partly out of the water to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Lake Champlain*. The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes.[84] Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy.[85] He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.[86]\n\n\nShepard served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 orbital flight, which he had also been considered for,[87] and Carpenter's Mercury-Atlas 7.[88] He was the backup pilot for Cooper for the Mercury-Atlas 9 mission,[89] nearly replacing Cooper after Cooper flew low over the NASA administration building at Cape Canaveral in an F-102.[90] In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission.[91] He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B *Freedom 7 II* in honor of his first spacecraft, and had the name painted on it,[92] but on June 12, 1963, NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced that Mercury had accomplished all its goals and no more missions would be flown.[91] Shepard went as far as making a personal appeal to President Kennedy, but to no avail.[93]\n\n\n\n### Project Gemini; Chief Astronaut[edit]\n\n\n![The men wear dark suits. A Naval officer in khaki stands behind them. The White House is in the background.](image)Shepard and his wife Louise meet First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson at the South Portico of the White House, prior to his receiving the NASA Distinguished Service Medal on May 8, 1961.\nProject Gemini, with a crew of two, followed on from Project Mercury.[94] After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was canceled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot.[95] In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director of Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.[96]\n\n\nThe doctors diagnosed M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear. This syndrome causes the semicircular canals and motion detectors to become extremely sensitive, resulting in disorientation, dizziness, and nausea. There was no known cure, but in about 20 percent of cases the condition goes away by itself. They prescribed diuretics in an attempt to drain the fluid from the ear. They also diagnosed glaucoma. An X-ray found a lump on his thyroid, and on January 17, 1964, surgeons at Hermann Hospital made an incision on his throat and removed 20 percent of his thyroid.[97][98] The condition caused Shepard to be removed from flight status. Grissom and John Young flew Gemini 3 instead.[99]\n\n\nShepard was designated Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963, receiving the title of Chief Astronaut.[100] He thereby became responsible for NASA astronaut training. This involved the development of appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment to be used by astronauts on space missions.[92] He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966.[101] He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle.[102] During this period, his secretary Gaye Alford had two \"mood-of-the-day\" photographs taken of Shepard, one of a smiling *Al* Shepard, and the other of a grim-looking *Commander* Shepard. To warn visitors of Shepard's mood, she would hang the appropriate photograph on the door of her boss's private office.[103] Tom Wolfe characterized Shepard's dual personalities as \"Smilin' Al\" and the \"Icy Commander\".[104]\n\n\n\n### Apollo program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 14\n\n![Mitchell, a smiling Shepard and Roosa wearing their Apollo space suits without the helmets.

Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube (endolymphatic-subarachnoid shunt) was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted on May 14, 1968, at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos.[92][105] The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.[92]\n\n\nSlayton put Shepard down to command the next available Moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment would have gone to Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was not given it. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![Shepard stands in a white flight suit in front of a vehicle made of tubing, with two metal spheres and a small cabin](image)Shepard in front of the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle during training for Apollo 14\nWhen Slayton submitted the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned them down on the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's crew was assigned to Apollo 14.[106][107]\n\n\nNeither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14,[106] but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion caused the Moon landing to be aborted and nearly resulted in the loss of the crew. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.[108]\n\n\nShepard made his second space flight as commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third successful lunar landing mission. Shepard piloted the Lunar Module *Antares*.[109] He became the fifth and, at the age of 47, the oldest man to walk on the Moon, and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.[110][111]\n\n\nThis was the first mission to broadcast extensive color television coverage from the lunar surface, using the Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera. (The same color camera model was used on Apollo 12 and provided about 30 minutes of color telecasting before it was inadvertently pointed at the Sun, ending its usefulness.) While on the Moon, Shepard used a Wilson six-iron head attached to a lunar sample scoop handle to drive golf balls.[109] Despite thick gloves and a stiff space suit, which forced him to swing the club with one hand, Shepard struck two golf balls, driving the second, as he jokingly put it, \"miles and miles and miles\".[112] Analysis of high-resolution film scans of the event determined the distance to be about 24 yards (22\u00a0m) for the first shot and 40 yards (37\u00a0m) for the second.[113][114]\n\n\n\n![An astronaut in an Apollo space suit with red stripes on the arms and legs and down the helmet stands amid gray dust, grasping the pole of an American flag](image)Shepard poses next to the American flag on the Moon during Apollo 14.\nFor this mission Shepard was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal[115] and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:\n\n\n> The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Captain Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr. (NSN: 0-389998), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States, as Spacecraft Commander for the Apollo 14 flight to the Fra-Mauro area of the Moon during the period 31 January 1971 to 9 February 1971. Responsible for the on-board control of the spacecraft command module *Kittyhawk* and the lunar module *Antares* in the gathering of scientific data involving complex and difficult instrumentation positing and sample gathering, including a hazardous two-mile traverse of the lunar surface, Captain Shepard, by his brilliant performance, contributed essentially to the success of this vital scientific Moon mission. As a result of his skillful leadership, professional competence and dedication, the Apollo 14 mission, with its numerous tasks and vital scientific experiments, was accomplished in an outstanding manner, enabling scientists to determine more precisely the Moon's original formation and further forecast man's proper role in the exploration of his Universe. By his courageous and determined devotion to duty, Captain Shepard rendered valuable and distinguished service and contributed greatly to the success of the United States Space Program, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.[86]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing Apollo 14, Shepard returned to his position as Chief of the Astronaut Office in June 1971. In July 1971 President Richard Nixon appointed him as a delegate to the 26th United Nations General Assembly, a position in which he served from September to December 1971.[92] He was promoted to rear admiral by Nixon on August 26, 1971, the first astronaut to reach this rank.[116][117] He was succeeded as Chief of the Astronaut Office by John Young on April 30, 1974.[118] Shepard retired from both NASA and the Navy on July 31, 1974.[92]\n\n\n\n## Later years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shepard in 1995\nShepard was devoted to his children. Frequently, Julie, Laura and Alice were the only astronauts' children at NASA events. He taught them to ski and took them skiing in Colorado. He once rented a small plane to fly them and their friends from Texas to a summer camp in Maine. He doted on his six grandchildren as well. After Apollo 14, he began to spend more time with Louise and started taking her with him on trips to the Paris Air Show every other year and to Asia.[119] Louise heard rumors of his affairs.[120] The publication of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book *The Right Stuff* made them public knowledge but she never confronted him about it[121] nor did she ever contemplate leaving him.[119]\n\n\nAfter Shepard left NASA, he served on the boards of many corporations. He also served as president of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, *Freedom 7* and Apollo 14).[122] He made a fortune in banking and real estate.[123] He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the board of directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute.[92] In 1984, together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell. As of 2022, daughter Laura Churchley leads the foundation's board of trustees.[92]\n\n\nIn 1994, he published a book with two journalists, Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict, called *Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon*. Fellow Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton is also named as an author. The book included a composite photograph showing Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon. There are no still images of this event, the only record is TV footage.[112] The book was turned into a TV miniseries in 1994.[124]\n\n\nShepard was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 1996 and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998.[125][126][110] Shepard's widow Louise had planned to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but before she was able to do that, she died from a heart attack\u2014on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, which, coincidentally, was the same time of day at which he had always phoned her when they were apart. They had been married for 53 years. Their family decided to cremate them both so their ashes were scattered, together, from a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove in front of their Pebble Beach home.[127][128]\n\n\nOn December 11, 2021, twenty-three years after his death, Shepard's daughter, Laura Shepard Churchley, also flew in space, while aboard the non-NASA Blue Origin's New Shepard 5 spaceship.[129][130]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nShepard was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter on October 1, 1978.[131] He also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1981;[132] the Langley Gold Medal on May 5, 1964; the John J. Montgomery Award in 1963; the Lambert trophy; the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award;[133] the Cabot Award; the Collier Trophy;[134] and the City of New York City Gold Medal for 1971.[92] He was awarded honorary degrees of Master of Arts from Dartmouth College in 1962, D.Sc. from Miami University in 1971, and Doctorate of Humanities from Franklin Pierce College in 1972.[92] He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1977,[135] the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981,[20][136] and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on May 11, 1990.[122][137]\n\n\n\n![A stone memorial plaque that reads: \"Love is Eternal \u2013 RADM Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr * US Navy * America's First man in Space 1998 \u2013 His loving wife Louise Brewer Shepard 1998\"](image)Shepard's memorial stone in Derry, New Hampshire. His ashes were scattered at sea.\nThe Navy named a supply ship, USNS\u00a0*Alan Shepard*\u00a0(T-AKE-3), for him in 2006.[138] The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, New Hampshire, is named after Shepard and Christa McAuliffe.[139] In 1996, the entirety of I-565 (which passes in front of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, home to both the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle and a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica) was designated the \"Admiral Alan B. Shepard Highway\" in his honor.[140] Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, from the Massachusetts border to Hooksett, is designated the Alan B. Shepard Highway,[141] and in Hampton, Virginia, a road is named Commander Shepard Boulevard in his honor.[142] His hometown of Derry has the nickname Space Town in honor of his career as an astronaut.[143] Following an act of Congress, the post office in Derry was designated the Alan B. Shepard Jr. Post Office Building.[144] Alan Shepard Park in Cocoa Beach, Florida, a beach-side park south of Cape Canaveral, is named in his honor.[145] The City of Virginia Beach renamed its convention center, with its integral geodesic dome, the *Alan B. Shepard Convention Center*. The building was later renamed the *Alan B. Shepard Civic Center*, and was razed in 1994.[146] At the time of the *Freedom 7* launch, Shepard lived in Virginia Beach.[147]\n\n\nShepard's high school alma mater in Derry, Pinkerton Academy, has a building named after him, and the school team is called the Astros after his career as an astronaut.[148] Alan B. Shepard High School, in Palos Heights, Illinois, which opened in 1976, was named in his honor. Framed newspapers throughout the school depict various accomplishments and milestones in Shepard's life. Additionally, an autographed plaque commemorates the dedication of the building. The school newspaper is named *Freedom 7* and the yearbook is entitled *Odyssey*.[149] Blue Origin's suborbital space tourism rocket, the New Shepard, is named after Shepard.[150]\n\n\nIn a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard was ranked as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Gus Grissom).[151] In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, consisting of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display.[152] On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.[153]\n\n\nEach year, the Space Foundation, in partnership with the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and NASA, present the Alan Shepard Technology in Education Award for outstanding contributions by K\u201312 educators or district-level administrators to educational technology. The award recognizes excellence in the development and application of technology in the classroom or to the professional development of teachers. The recipient demonstrates exemplary use of technology either to foster lifelong learners or to make the learning process easier.[154]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nAs a key figure in the American space program, Shepard's life has been depicted in many biographical and historical works of fiction. In film, Shepard's selection for the Mercury program was covered in 1983's *The Right Stuff* (where he was played by Scott Glenn),[155] while 2002's *Race to Space* and 2016's *Hidden Figures* feature him in a minor role, played by Mark Moses,[156] and Dane Davenport, respectively.[157] The HBO miniseries *From the Earth to the Moon* starred Ted Levine as Shepard and covered not only his Mercury training but also his involvement in the Apollo missions.[158] Jake McDorman played Shepard in the 2020 TV adaptation of *The Right Stuff*,[159] while Desmond Harrington played him in the 2015 period drama *The Astronaut Wives Club*.[160]\n\n\nArchive footage of Shepard is used in the opening credits montage of *Star Trek: Enterprise*,as part of a sequence displaying the history of human exploration,[161] while other science fiction works have named characters in a tribute to Shepard \u2013 including both the character of Alan Tracy, in the 1960s British series *Thunderbirds*,[162] and Commander Shepard, the main protagonist of the 2007\u20132012 BioWare video game series *Mass Effect*.[163]\n\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Darren Hayman's concept album *12 Astronauts* includes a song for each man who has walked on the Moon. The lyrics of *Don't Clip My Wings (Alan Shepard)*, sung in the first person, reflect on how Shepard \"feared he would never fly again\" after his M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's diagnosis.[164]\n\n\n\"Shepard's Prayer\" is attributed to Shepard, with the phrase supposed to have been uttered by him while he awaited liftoff aboard the *Freedom 7*. It is usually quoted as \"Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up\", although Shepard claimed the words to be \"Don't fuck up, Shepard\".[165]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Survey no.136 - 64 Hampstead Road\". *NHSHPO Reconnaissance Survey Form State Historical Resources Survey*.

Selected as part of the third group of astronauts in 1963, Scott flew to space three times and commanded Apollo\u00a015, the fourth lunar landing; he is one of four surviving Moon walkers and the only living commander of a spacecraft that landed on the Moon.[2]\n\n\nBefore becoming an astronaut, Scott graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and joined the Air Force. After serving as a fighter pilot in Europe, he graduated from the Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62C) and the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class IV). Scott retired from the Air Force in 1975 with the rank of colonel, and more than 5,600 hours of logged flying time.\n\n\nAs an astronaut, Scott made his first flight into space as a pilot of the Gemini\u00a08 mission, along with Neil Armstrong, in March 1966, spending just under eleven hours in low Earth orbit. He would have been the second American astronaut to walk in space had Gemini\u00a08 not made an emergency abort. Scott then spent ten days in orbit in March 1969 as Command Module Pilot of Apollo\u00a09, a mission that extensively tested the Apollo spacecraft, along with Commander James McDivitt and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart.\n\n\nAfter backing up Apollo\u00a012, Scott made his third and final flight into space as commander of the Apollo\u00a015 mission, the fourth crewed lunar landing and the first J mission. Scott and James Irwin remained on the Moon for three days. Following their return to Earth, Scott and his crewmates fell from favor with NASA after it was disclosed that they had carried four hundred unauthorized postal covers to the Moon. After serving as director of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in California, Scott retired from the agency in 1977. Since then, he has worked on a number of space-related projects and served as a consultant for several films about the space program, including *Apollo\u00a013*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nScott was born June 6, 1932, at Randolph Field (for which he received his middle name) near San Antonio, Texas.[3][4] His father was Tom William Scott (1902\u20131988), a fighter pilot in the United States Army Air Corps who would rise to the rank of brigadier general; his mother was Marian Scott (n\u00e9e\u00a0Davis; 1904\u20131999).[5] Scott lived his earliest years at Randolph Field, where his father was stationed, before moving to an air base in Indiana, and then in 1936 to Manila in the Philippines, then under U.S. rule. David remembered his father as a strict disciplinarian. The family returned to the United States in December 1939. By the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the family was living in San Antonio again; shortly thereafter Tom Scott was deployed overseas.[6]\n\n\nAs it was felt that he needed more discipline than he would receive with his father gone for three years, David was sent to Texas Military Institute, spending his summers at Hermosa Beach in California with his father's college friend, David Shattuck, after whom he had been named. Determined to become a pilot like his father, David built many model airplanes and watched with fascination war films about flying. By the time of Tom Scott's return, David was old enough to be allowed to go up in a military aircraft with him, and in David Scott's autobiography remembered it as \"the most exciting thing I had ever experienced\".[7]\n\n\nDavid Scott was active in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving its second-highest rank, Life Scout.[8] With Tom Scott assigned to March Air Force Base near Riverside, California, David attended Riverside Polytechnic High School, where he joined the swimming team and set several state and local records. Before David could finish high school, Tom Scott was transferred to Washington, D.C., and after some discussion as to whether he should remain in California to graduate, David attended Western High School in Washington, graduating in June 1949.[9]\n\n\nDavid Scott wanted an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point but lacked connections to secure one.[10] He took a government civil service examination for competitive appointments and accepted a swimming scholarship to the University of Michigan where he was an honor student in the engineering school. In the spring of 1950, he received and accepted an invitation to attend West Point.[10] Scott attended Michigan on a swimming scholarship, set a freshman record in the 440-yard freestyle, and the team captain during Scott's year there, Jack Craigie, recalled that the West Point swimming coach, Gordon Chalmers, was happy to get Scott from Michigan, one of the dominant programs of the time.[11]\n\n\nScott still wanted to fly and wanted to be commissioned in the newly established United States Air Force (USAF).[12] The Air Force Academy was founded in 1954, the year Scott graduated from West Point; an interim arrangement had been made whereby a quarter of West Point and United States Naval Academy graduates could volunteer to be commissioned as Air Force officers.[13] Earning a Bachelor of Science degree in military science,[14] Scott graduated 5th in his class of 633 and was commissioned in the Air Force.[15]\n\n\n\n## Air Force pilot[edit]\n\n\nScott did six months of primary pilot training at Marana Air Base in Arizona, beginning there in July 1954.[15] He completed Undergraduate Pilot Training at Webb Air Force Base, Texas, in 1955, then went through gunnery training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.[16]\n\n\nFrom April 1956 to July 1960, Scott flew with the 32d Tactical Fighter Squadron at Soesterberg Air Base, Netherlands, flying F-86 Sabres and F-100 Super Sabres.[16] The weather there was often poor, and Scott's piloting skills were tested.[17] Once, he had to land his plane on a golf course after a flameout. On another, he barely made it to a Dutch base on the edge of the North Sea.[18] Scott served in Europe during the Cold War and tensions were often high between the U.S. and Soviet Union. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, his squadron was placed on the highest alert for weeks but was stood down without going into combat.[19]\n\n\nScott hoped to advance his career by becoming a test pilot, to be trained at Edwards Air Force Base. He was counseled that the best way to get into test pilot school was to gain a graduate degree in aeronautics. Accordingly, he applied to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was accepted.[20] He received both a Master of Science degree in Aeronautics/Astronautics and the degree of Engineer in Aeronautics/Astronautics (the E.A.A. degree) from MIT in 1962.[21]\n\n\nAfter receiving these degrees, Scott was stunned to receive orders from the Air Force to report to the new Air Force Academy as a professor, rather than to test pilot school. Although challenging orders was strongly discouraged, Scott went to the Pentagon and found a sympathetic ear from a colonel. Scott received changed orders to report to Edwards.[22]\n\n\nScott reported to the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards in July 1962. The commandant of the school was Chuck Yeager, the first person to break the sound barrier, whom Scott idolized; Scott got to fly several times with him. Scott graduated top pilot in his class. He was selected for the Aerospace Research Pilot School, also at Edwards, where those intended as Air Force astronauts were trained. There he learned how to control aircraft, such as the Lockheed NF-104A, at altitudes of up to 100,000 feet (30,000\u00a0m).[23][24]\n\n\n\n## NASA career[edit]\n\n\n![Scott in black suit and tie](image)Scott in 1964\nIn applying to be part of the third group of astronauts in 1963, Scott intended only a temporary detour from a mainstream military career; he expected to fly in space a couple of times and then return to the Air Force.[24] He was accepted as one of the fourteen Group\u00a03 astronauts later that year.[25]\n\n\nScott's initial assignment was as an astronaut representative at MIT supervising the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer. He spent most of 1964 and 1965 in residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[26][27] He served as backup CAPCOM during Gemini\u00a04 and as a CAPCOM during Gemini\u00a05.[28]\n\n\n\n### Gemini 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gemini 8\n\nAfter the conclusion of Gemini 5, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton informed Scott that he would fly with Neil Armstrong on Gemini\u00a08.[29] This made Scott the first Group\u00a03 astronaut to become a member of a prime crew, and this without having served on a backup crew. Scott was highly regarded by his colleagues for his piloting credentials; another Group\u00a03 astronaut, Michael Collins, wrote later that Scott's selection to fly with Armstrong helped convince him that NASA knew what it was doing.[30]\n\n\n\n![Three men, two of them in space suits, standing on a vessel](image)Scott (right) and Neil Armstrong (center) train for water egress.\nScott found Armstrong something of a taskmaster, but the two men greatly respected each other and worked well together.[31] They spent most of the seven months before launch in each other's company. One part of the training that Scott undertook without Armstrong was riding the Vomit Comet, where he practiced in preparation for a planned spacewalk.[32]\n\n\nOn March 16, 1966, Armstrong and Scott were launched into space, a flight originally planned to last three days. The Agena rocket with which they were to dock had been launched an hour and forty minutes earlier. They carefully approached and docked with the Agena, the first docking ever accomplished in space. However, after the docking, there was unexpected movement by the joined craft. Mission Control was out of touch during this portion of the orbit, and the astronauts' belief that the Agena was causing the problem proved incorrect, for once they performed an emergency undocking, the spin only got worse. With the spacecraft spinning, there was a risk of the astronauts blacking out or the Gemini vehicle disintegrating. The problem was one of the craft's Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) thrusters firing unexpectedly; the crew shut down those thrusters, and Armstrong activated the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to negate the spin. The RCS thrusters were to be used for reentry, and the mission rules said if they were activated early, Gemini\u00a08 had to return to Earth.[33] Gemini\u00a08 splashed down in the Western Pacific on the day of launch; the mission lasted only ten hours, and the early termination meant that Scott's spacewalk was scrubbed.[34]\n\n\nAccording to Francis French and Colin Burgess in their book on NASA and the Space Race, \"Scott, in particular, had shown incredible presence of mind during the unexpected events of the Gemini\u00a08 mission. Even in the middle of an emergency, out of contact with Mission Control, he had thought to reenable ground control command of the Agena before the two vehicles separated.\"[35] This allowed NASA to check the Agena from the ground, and use it for a subsequent Gemini mission. Scott's competence was recognized by NASA when, five days after the brief flight, he was assigned to an Apollo crew.[36] Along with Armstrong, Scott received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal,[37] and the Air Force awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross as well. He was also promoted to lieutenant colonel.[38]\n\n\n\n### Apollo 9[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 9\n\n![Six men in flight suits](image)The prime and backup crews for Apollo 1. Scott is standing at left.\nScott's Apollo assignment was as backup senior pilot/navigator for what would become known as Apollo\u00a01, scheduled for launch in February 1967, with Jim McDivitt as backup commander and Russell Schweickart as pilot. In that capacity, they spent much of their time at North American Rockwell's plant in Downey, California, where the command and service module (CSM) for that mission was under construction.[39]\n\n\nBy January 1967, Scott's crew had been assigned as prime crew for a subsequent Apollo mission and were at Downey on January 27 when a fire took the lives of the Apollo\u00a01 prime crew during a pre-launch test.[40] During the fire, the inward-opening hatch had proved impossible for the astronauts to open, and Scott's post-fire assignment, with all flights put on hold amid a complete review of the Apollo program, was to serve on the team designing a simpler, outward-opening hatch.[41]\n\n\nAfter the pause, Scott's crew was assigned to Apollo 8, intended to be an Earth-orbit test of the full Apollo spacecraft, including the Lunar Module (LM).[42] There were delays in the development of the lunar module and in August 1968, NASA official George Low proposed that if Apollo\u00a07 in October went well, Apollo\u00a08 should go to lunar orbit without a Lunar Module, so as not to hold up the program. The Earth-orbit test would become Apollo\u00a09.[43] McDivitt was offered Apollo\u00a08 by Slayton, but turned it down on behalf of his crew (who fully agreed), preferring to wait for Apollo 9, which would involve extensive testing of the spacecraft and was dubbed \"a test pilot's dream\".[44]\n\n\nAs command module pilot for Apollo\u00a09 Scott's responsibilities were heavy. The LM was to separate from the CSM during the mission; if it failed to return, Scott would have to run the entire spacecraft for reentry, normally a three-man job. He would also have to go rescue the LM if it could not perform the rendezvous, and if it could not dock, would have to assist McDivitt and Schweickart in performing an extravehicular activity (EVA) or spacewalk, back to the CSM.[45] Scott was somewhat unhappy, though, that CSM-103, which he had worked on extensively, would stay with Apollo\u00a08, with Apollo\u00a09 given CSM-104.[46]\n\n\n\n![Astronaut halfway out of spacecraft, Earth in background](image)Scott stands in the open hatch of the Apollo\u00a09 Command Module *Gumdrop*.\nThe planned February 28, 1969, launch date was postponed as all three astronauts had head colds, and NASA was wary of medical issues in space after problems on Apollo\u00a07 and Apollo\u00a08.[47] The launch took place on March 3, 1969. Within hours of launch, Scott had performed a maneuver essential to the lunar landing by piloting the CSM *Gumdrop* away from the S-IVB rocket stage, then turned *Gumdrop* around and docked with the LM *Spider* still attached to the S-IVB, before the combined spacecraft separated from the rocket.[48]\n\n\nSchweickart vomited twice on the third day in space, suffering from space adaptation syndrome. He was supposed to do a spacewalk from the LM's hatch to that of the CM the following day, proving that this could be done under emergency conditions, but because of concerns about his condition, simply exited the LM while Scott stood in the CM's hatch, bringing in experiments and photographing Schweickart. On the fifth day in space, March 7, McDivitt and Schweickart in the LM *Spider* flew away from the CSM while Scott remained in *Gumdrop*, making him the first American astronaut to be alone in space since the Mercury program. After the redocking, *Spider* was jettisoned.[49] The LM had gone over 100 miles (160\u00a0km) from the CSM during the test.[16]\n\n\nThe remainder of the mission was devoted to tests of the command module, mostly performed by Scott; Schweickart called these days \"Dave Scott's mission\"; McDivitt and Schweickart had much time to observe the Earth as Scott worked. The mission stayed in space one orbit longer than planned due to rough seas in the Atlantic Ocean recovery zone.[50] Apollo\u00a09 splashed down on March 13, 1969, less than four nautical miles (7\u00a0km) from the helicopter carrier USS *Guadalcanal*,[16] 180 miles (290\u00a0km) east of the Bahamas.[51]\n\n\n\n### Apollo 15[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 15\n\nScott lands the Apollo\u00a015 Lunar Module *Falcon* on the Moon on July 30, 1971, seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot. Starts at approximately 5000 feet from the surface.\n![A man in a dress shirt and tie wearing a headset](image)Scott in Mission Control during Apollo\u00a011\nScott was deemed to have performed his duties well, and on April 10, 1969, was named backup commander of Apollo\u00a012,[52] with Al Worden as command module pilot and James Irwin as lunar module pilot. McDivitt had chosen to go into NASA management, and Slayton had seen Scott as a potential crew commander; Worden and Irwin were working on the support crews for Apollo\u00a09 and Apollo\u00a010, respectively. Schweickart was ruled out due to the space sickness episode. This put the three in line to be the prime crew for Apollo\u00a015.[53] Scott's status as backup commander of the next flight allowed him to sit in the Mission Control room as Apollo\u00a011, with his old crewmate Armstrong in command, landed on the Moon.[54] That Scott, Worden, and Irwin would be the crew of Apollo\u00a015 was announced on March 26, 1970.[55]\n\n\n\n![Lunar roving vehicle on Moon](image)Scott on the LRV\nApollo 15 would be the first J Mission, which emphasized scientific research, with longer stays on the Moon's surface and the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). Already having an interest in geology, Scott made time during the training for his crew to go on field trips with Caltech geologist Lee Silver. The scientists were divided over where Apollo\u00a015 should land; Scott's argument for the area of Hadley Rille won the day. As time dwindled towards the launch date, Scott pushed to make the field trips more like what they would encounter on the lunar surface, with mock backpacks simulating what they would wear on the Moon, and from November 1970 onwards, the training version of the LRV.[56]\n\n\nApollo 15 launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A on July 26, 1971. The outward flight to the Moon's orbit saw only minor difficulties, and the mission entered lunar orbit without incident.[57] The descent to the Moon by the LM *Falcon*, with Scott and Irwin aboard, took place on the late afternoon of July 30, with Scott as commander attempting the landing.[58] Despite difficulties caused by the computer-controlled flight path being to the south of what was planned, Scott assumed manual control for the final descent, and successfully landed the *Falcon* within the designated landing zone.[59]\n\n\n\n> \n> Man must explore. And this is exploration at its greatest.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 David Scott[60]\n\nAfter landing, Scott and Irwin donned the helmets and gloves of their pressure suits and Scott performed the first and only stand-up EVA on the lunar surface,[nb 1] by poking his head and upper body out of the docking port on top of the LM. He took panoramic photographs of the surrounding area from an elevated position and scouted the terrain they would be driving across the next day.[16] After deploying the LRV from its folded-up position on the side of the LM's descent stage, Scott drove with Irwin in the direction of Hadley Rille. Once there, Scott marveled at the beauty of the scene. While their exploits were followed by a television camera mounted on the Rover and controlled from Earth, Scott and Irwin took samples of the lunar surface, including the rock Great Scott named after the astronaut, before returning to the LM to set up the ALSEP, the experiments that were to continue to run after their departure.[62]\n\n\n\nUsing a hammer and a feather, Scott validates Galileo's theory that objects in a vacuum will fall at the same rate.\nThe second traverse, the following day (August 1) was to the slope of Mount Hadley Delta. At Spur Crater, they discovered one of the most famous lunar samples, a plagioclase-rich anorthosite from the early lunar crust, that was later dubbed the Genesis Rock by the press. On the third day, August 2, they went on their final moonwalk, an excursion cut short by problems with retrieving a core sample. On their return to the LM, Scott, before the television camera, dropped a hammer and a feather to demonstrate Galileo's theory that objects in a vacuum will drop at the same rate. After driving the LRV to a position where the camera could view *Falcon*'s takeoff, Scott left a memorial to the astronauts and cosmonauts who had died to advance space exploration. This consisted of a plaque bearing their names, and a small aluminum sculpture, *Fallen Astronaut*, by Paul Van Hoeydonck. Once this was done, Scott re-entered the LM, and soon thereafter, *Falcon* lifted off from the Moon.[57][63]\n\n\nApollo 15 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean north of Honolulu on August 7, 1971. The first crew to land on the Moon and not be quarantined on return, the astronauts were flown to Houston, and after debriefing, were sent off on the usual circuit of addresses to Congress, celebrations, and foreign trips that met returning Apollo astronauts. Scott regretted the lack of quarantine, which he felt would have given them time to recover from the flight, as the demands on their time were heavy.[64]\n\n\n\n### Postal covers incident[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 15 postal covers incident\n\n![A rectangle with the headline \"An Apollo 15 Flown Lunar Postal Cover\" with a logo in the middle. Below it are two smaller frames. One has some text certifying that what was below was flown to the Moon and back, signed by flight commander David Scott. Below it is an envelope with stamps, logos and, postmarks.](image)One of the covers that were taken to the lunar surface\nThe crew had arranged with a friend named Horst Eiermann to carry postal covers to the Moon in exchange for about $7,000 for each astronaut.[65] Slayton had issued regulations that personal items taken in spacecraft must be listed for his approval;[66] which was not done for the covers.[67] Scott carried the covers into the CM in his spacesuit; they were transferred to the LM en route to the Moon and landed there with the astronauts.[68] Scott sent 100 of them to Eiermann, and in late 1971, against the astronauts' wishes, the covers were offered for sale by West German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger.[69] The astronauts returned the money,[70] but in April 1972, Slayton learned of the unauthorized covers[71] and had Scott, Worden, and Irwin removed as backup crew members for Apollo\u00a017. The matter became public in June 1972,[72] and the astronauts were reprimanded for poor judgment by NASA and the Air Force the following month.[73][74] The covers that the crew still had were initially impounded by NASA but were in 1983 returned to the astronauts in an out-of-court settlement, as the government felt it could not successfully defend the lawsuit, and that NASA either authorized the covers to be flown or was aware of them.[75]\n\n\nThe press release that announced the reprimands, dated July 11, 1972, stated that the astronauts' \"actions will be given due consideration in their selection for future assignment\",[76] something that made it extremely unlikely that they would be selected to fly in space again.[77] *Newsweek* reported that \"there are no forthcoming missions for which he [Scott] is being considered\".[78] Scott related in his autobiography that Alan Shepard, then head of the Astronaut Office, had offered him the choice between backing up Apollo\u00a017 or serving as a special assistant on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first joint mission with the Soviet Union; Scott had chosen the latter.[79] Although a NASA spokesman had stated that Scott had no choice but to leave the Astronaut Corps, and this was reproduced in the press, Slayton's supervisor, Christopher C. Kraft, stated that the Public Affairs Office at NASA had erred, and the transfer was not a further rebuke.[80]\n\n\n\n### NASA management[edit]\n\n\n![Dryden's wife next to a bust of Dryden, Scott by her side](image)Scott (right) as Center Director at Dryden, 1976\nIn his role with Apollo-Soyuz, Scott traveled to Moscow, leading a team of technical experts. There he met the commander of the Soviet part of the mission, Alexei Leonov, with whom he would later write a joint autobiography.[81] In 1973 Scott was offered the job of deputy director of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, located at Edwards, a place Scott had long loved. This allowed Scott to fly aircraft that reached the edge of space, and let him renew his acquaintance with the retired Chuck Yeager who was there as a consulting test pilot, and to whom Scott granted flying privileges.[82]\n\n\nOn April 18, 1975, at age 42, Scott became the Center Director at Dryden.[1] This was a civilian appointment, and to accept it, Scott retired from the Air Force in March 1975 with the rank of colonel.[83] Kraft wrote in his memoirs that Scott's appointment \"pissed off Deke to his eyebrows\".[84] Scott found the work interesting and exciting, but with budget cuts and the forthcoming end of Approach and Landing Tests for the Space Shuttle, in 1977 he decided it was time to leave NASA[85] and retired from the agency on September 30, 1977.[1]\n\n\n\n## Post-NASA career[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Scott in February 2009\nEntering the private sector, Scott founded Scott Science and Technology, Inc.[1] In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Scott worked on several government projects, including designing the astronaut training for a proposed Air Force version of the Space Shuttle.[86] One of Scott's firms went out of business after the 1986 *Challenger* disaster; though the company played no part in the disaster, subsequent redesign of parts of the shuttle eliminated Scott's firm's role.[87] After *Challenger*, Scott served four years on the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee, formed to advise the Secretary of Transportation on the possible conversion of ICBMs to launch vehicles.[88] In 1992 Scott was found by a Prescott, Arizona, court to have defrauded nine investors in a partnership organized by him.[87] He was ordered to pay roughly $400,000 to investors in the partnership, which was to create technology to prevent aircraft mechanical breakdowns, but which was never developed.[89]\n\n\nScott was a commentator for British television on the first Space Shuttle flight (STS-1) in April 1981.[88] He also was a consultant on the film *Apollo\u00a013* and for the 1998 HBO miniseries *From the Earth to the Moon*,[88] in which he was portrayed by Brett Cullen.[90] Scott consulted on the 3D IMAX film, *Magnificent Desolation* (2005), showing Apollo astronauts on the Moon, and produced by Tom Hanks and the IMAX Corporation.[88] He is one of the astronauts featured in the 2007 book and documentary *In the Shadow of the Moon*.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chevrolet Corvettes owned by Scott (right) and Worden during the training for Apollo\u00a015, photographed in 2019\nFrom 2003 to 2004, Scott was a consultant on the BBC TV series *Space Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets*.[92] In 2004, he and Leonov began work on a dual biography/history of the \"Space Race\" between the United States and the Soviet Union. The book, *Two Sides of the Moon: Our Story of the Cold War Space Race*, was published in 2006. Armstrong and Hanks both wrote introductions to the book. Scott has worked on the Brown University science teams for the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter. For NASA, he has worked on the 500-Day Lunar Exploration Study and as a collaborator on the research investigation entitled \"Advanced Visualization in Solar System Exploration and Research (ADVISER): Optimizing the Science Return from the Moon and Mars\".[88]\n\n\nScott had taken two Bulova timepieces, a wristwatch and a stopwatch, with him to the Moon without advance authorization from Slayton.[93] Scott wore the wristwatch on the third EVA, after his NASA-issued Omega Speedmaster lost its crystal. He sold the Bulova watch in 2015 for $1.625\u00a0million, after which the company marketed similar timepieces, whose accompanying material mentioned Scott and Apollo\u00a015. Scott sued in federal court in 2017, alleging Bulova and Kay Jewelers were wrongfully using his name and image for commercial purposes, and in April 2018, a federal magistrate ruled he could proceed on some of his claims.[94] The case was dismissed by agreement of the parties in August 2018,[95] and in 2021, Bulova marked the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo\u00a015 with the issuance of a commemorative watch.[96]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Scott with his first wife Ann and their two children\n![](image)The spacesuit Scott wore during the Apollo\u00a015 Moon mission is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.\nIn 1959 Scott married his first wife, Ann Lurton Ott. He had two children with her: Tracy (born 1961) and Douglas (born 1963). In 2000, it was reported that he was engaged to British TV presenter Anna Ford; at the time he was still married to Ann Scott, although separated. His relationship with Ford had begun in 1999.[87] By 2001, Scott and Ford had separated.[97] He subsequently married Margaret Black, former vice-chairman of Morgan Stanley.[88] David Scott and Margaret Black-Scott reside in Los Angeles.[88]\n\n\n\n## Awards, honors, and organizations[edit]\n\n\nDeputy Administrator Robert Seamans presented Scott and Armstrong the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1966 for their Gemini flight.[38][98] Scott was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the Gemini\u00a08 flight.[99] Vice President Spiro Agnew presented the Apollo\u00a09 crew with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. At the ceremony, Agnew said, \"I am proud that America has forged to the forefront and established the leadership in space to match our new leadership on Earth.\"[100] Scott received the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for the Apollo\u00a09 mission.[99]\n\n\nAgnew also gave the Apollo 15 crew the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.[101] Scott earned his second Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for Apollo\u00a015.[99] On September 15, 1971, the city of Chicago hosted the Apollo\u00a015 crew in a parade attended by more than 200,000 people. Mayor Daley presented the crew with honorary citizenship medals.[102] On August 25, 1971, the Apollo\u00a015 crew were honored with a ticker-tape parade in New York City. The city bestowed them with gold medals. Later that day, U.N. Secretary General Thant awarded the trio the first United Nations Peace Medal.[103][104] At the Air Force Association's annual dinner dance in September 1971, the Apollo\u00a015 crew were presented with the David C. Schilling Trophy, the association's top flight award. Scott presented the Air Force and Air Force Association with items they flew to the Moon: sheet music of \"Into the Wild Blue Yonder\" and a U.S. Air Force flag.[105] The Apollo\u00a015 crew and Robert Gilruth (director of the Manned Spacecraft Center) were awarded the 1971 Robert J. Collier Trophy, an annual award for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics.[106] Scott received the De la Vaulx Medal, the Gold Space Medal, and the V.M. Komorav Diploma from F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale for 1971 for his role in the Apollo\u00a015 flight.[107] Scott was awarded his third NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1978.[16]\n\n\nScott, Worden, and Irwin were granted honorary Doctorates of Astronautical Science from the University of Michigan in 1971.[108] Scott was awarded an honorary doctor of science and technology degree from Jacksonville University in 2013. It was the first honorary degree bestowed by the university.[109]\n\n\nScott is a fellow of the American Astronautical Society, an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Sigma Gamma Tau.[16]\n\n\nIn 1982 Scott was inducted with nine other Gemini astronauts into the International Space Hall of Fame in the New Mexico Museum of Space History.[1][110] Along with twelve other Gemini astronauts, Scott was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993.[88][111]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of spaceflight records\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A stand-up EVA is when the astronaut only partially exits the spacecraft.[61]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\nNumbers for Worden/French and for Slayton are Kindle locations.\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"David R.

He made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission. He was the Lunar Module *Eagle* pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission and became the second person to walk on the Moon after mission commander Neil Armstrong.\n\n\nBorn in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned into the United States Air Force and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.\n\n\nAfter earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis, *Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous*, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion.\n\n\nAfter leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972 after 21 years of service. His autobiographies *Return to Earth* (1973) and *Magnificent Desolation* (2009) recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. Aldrin continues to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars. He developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in terms of time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAldrin was born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. on January 20, 1930, at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.[1] His parents, Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. and Marion Aldrin (n\u00e9e Moon), lived in neighboring Montclair.[2] His father was an Army aviator during World War I and the assistant commandant of the Army's test pilot school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at Standard Oil.[3] Aldrin had two sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older.[4] His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988,[5][6] arose as a result of Fay's mispronouncing \"brother\" as \"buzzer\", which was then shortened to \"Buzz\".[4][7] He was a Boy Scout, achieving the rank of Tenderfoot Scout.[8]\n\n\nAldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average.[9] He played football and was the starting center for Montclair High School's undefeated 1946 state champion team.[10][11] His father wanted him to go to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and enrolled him at nearby Severn School, a preparatory school for Annapolis, and even secured him a Naval Academy appointment from Albert W. Hawkes, one of the United States senators from New Jersey.[12] Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946,[13] but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[12]\n\n\nAldrin entered West Point in 1947.[5] He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year.[9] Aldrin was also an excellent athlete, competing in pole vault for the academy track and field team.[14][15] In 1950, he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of Douglas MacArthur.[16] During the trip, the Korean War broke out.[17] On June 5, 1951, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.[18]\n\n\n\n## Military career[edit]\n\n\nAmong the top of his class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the United States Air Force, which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy.[19][a] He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and underwent basic flight training in T-6 Texans at Bartow Air Base in Florida. His classmates included Sam Johnson, who later became a prisoner of war in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double Immelmann turn in a T-28 Trojan and suffered a grayout. He recovered in time to pull out at about 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m), averting what would have been a fatal crash.[21]\n\n\n\n![Aldrin in a cockpit with canopy pulled back](image)Aldrin in the cockpit of a 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing F-86 Sabre after shooting down a MiG-15 fighter during the Korean War\nWhen Aldrin was deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose bombers, because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly fighters. He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre. Like most jet fighter pilots of the era, he preferred the latter.[21]\n\n\nIn December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was part of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. At the time it was based at Suwon Air Base, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) south of Seoul, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War.[18][22] During an acclimatization flight, his main fuel system froze at 100\u00a0percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.[22][23]\n\n\nThe first MiG-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) south of the Yalu River, when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming.[22][24] The June 8, 1953, issue of *Life* magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.[25]\n\n\n\n![six shots of a MiG, showing the pilot bailing out](image)Aldrin's gun camera footage featured in *Life* magazine\nAldrin's second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of scissor maneuvers, attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG's canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open.[24][26] For his service in Korea, he was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Air Medals.[27]\n\n\nAldrin's year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis.[18] In December 1954 he became an aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Don Z. Zimmerman, the Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy, which opened in 1955.[28][29] That same year, he graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.[30] From 1956 to 1959 he flew F-100 Super Sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in the 22nd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Wing, stationed at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany.[18][24][28] Among his squadron colleagues was Ed White, who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left West Germany to study for a master's degree at the University of Michigan in aeronautical engineering, he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.[15]\n\n\n\n![Aldrin in cockpit, canopy tilted up](image)Aldrin in the cockpit of a Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star as an instructor at Bryan Air Force Base, Texas\nThrough the Air Force Institute of Technology, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959 intending to earn a master's degree.[31] Richard Battin was the professor for his astrodynamics class. Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, David Scott and Edgar Mitchell, took the course around this time. Another USAF officer, Charles Duke, also took the course and wrote his 1964 master's degree at MIT under the supervision of Laurence R. Young.[32]\n\n\nAldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead.[31] In January 1963, he earned a Sc.D. degree in astronautics.[28][33] His doctoral thesis was *Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous*, the dedication of which read: \"In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country's present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!\"[33] Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing test pilot training, which was a prerequisite at the time.[31]\n\n\nAfter completing his doctorate Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles,[15] working with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the Agena target vehicle which was to be used by NASA's Project Gemini. He was then posted to the Space Systems Division's field office at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, where he was involved in integrating Department of Defense experiments into Project Gemini flights.[34]\n\n\n\n## NASA career[edit]\n\n\nAldrin initially applied to join the astronaut corps when NASA's Astronaut Group 2 was selected in 1962. His application was rejected on the grounds that he was not a test pilot. Aldrin was aware of the requirement and asked for a waiver but the request was turned down.[35] On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft.[36] Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets.[34] His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA's Astronaut Group 3 was announced on October 18, 1963.[37] This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from his fellow astronauts.[38][39][40] Although Aldrin was both the most educated and the rendezvous expert in the astronaut corps,[14] he was aware that the nickname was not always intended as a compliment.[15] Upon completion of initial training, each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise; in Aldrin's case, it was mission planning, trajectory analysis, and flight plans.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### Gemini program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Project Gemini\n\nJim Lovell and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of Gemini 10, commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was Gemini 12.[43] The February 28, 1966, deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash, led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12.[44][45] They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Gemini 12[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gemini 12\n\n![Astronaut performing EVA](image)Aldrin stands in space while in the Gemini 12 spacecraft, with Earth in the background.\nInitially, Gemini 12's mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions.[47] While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about extravehicular activity (EVA). Cernan on Gemini\u00a09 and Richard Gordon on Gemini\u00a011 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but Michael Collins had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.[48][49]\n\n\nIt therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini's EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force's astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini\u00a011 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight. Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from nine on Gemini\u00a09 to 44 on Gemini\u00a012, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.[48][49]\n\n\n\n![Astronaut performing EVA](image)Aldrin next to the Agena work station in November 1966\nGemini 12's main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini\u00a012 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments.[50] It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.[49]\n\n\nGemini\u00a012 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Canaveral on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before.[50] The mission's first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini\u00a012 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle.[51] Gemini\u00a012 achieved the fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle.[52]\n\n\nThe next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini's thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved.[52] Instead, the Agena's secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the solar eclipse of November 12, 1966, over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.[50]\n\n\n\n![Astronauts in spacesuits exiting helicopter on aircraft carrier](image)Aldrin and Jim Lovell arrive on the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Wasp* after the Gemini\u00a012 mission.\nAldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Project Apollo. A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.[50][53]\n\n\nOn November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, where they were picked up by a helicopter, which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Wasp*.[50][54] After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.[51]\n\n\n\n### Apollo program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo program\n\nLovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with Neil Armstrong as commander, Lovell as command module pilot (CMP), and Aldrin as lunar module pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of Apollo 9 was announced on November 20, 1967.[55] Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo\u00a09 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was expected to command Apollo 11.[56]\n\n\n\n![Aldrin and Armstrong performing geological training in desert](image)Aldrin photographs a geological specimen while Neil Armstrong looks on.\nMichael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo\u00a08 prime crew, required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine.[57] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[58] While the CMP usually occupied the center couch on launch, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.[59]\n\n\nApollo\u00a011 was the second American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space,[60] the first being Apollo 10.[61] The next would not be flown until STS-26 in 1988.[60] Deke Slayton, who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.[62]\n\n\nEarly versions of the EVA checklist had the lunar module pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[63] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[64]\nAldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo was briefed by NASA and USGS geologists. They made one geological field trip to West Texas. The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Apollo 11[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 11\n\nOn the morning of July 16, 1969, an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo\u00a011 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts.[66][67] Propelled by a Saturn V rocket, Apollo\u00a011 lifted off from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT),[68] and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About thirty minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the command module *Columbia* from the spent S-IVB stage; turning around; and docking with, and extracting, the lunar module *Eagle*. The combined spacecraft then headed for the Moon, while the S-IVB stage continued on a trajectory past the Moon.[69]\n\n\n\n![Aldrin stands on the Moon. Armstrong and the Lunar Module Eagle are reflected in his visor.](image)Aldrin walks on the surface of the Moon during Apollo 11. Photograph by Neil Armstrong, who can be seen reflected in Aldrin's visor.Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo\u00a011 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.[69] In the thirty orbits that followed,[70] the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of the crater Sabine D.[71] At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered *Eagle*, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 *Eagle* separated from the *Columbia*.[69] Collins, alone aboard *Columbia*, inspected *Eagle* as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear had correctly deployed.[72][73]\n\n\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the *Eagle*.[74] Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800\u00a0m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[75] Due to the 1202/1201 program alarms caused by spurious rendezvous radar inputs to the LGC,[76] Armstrong manually landed the *Eagle* instead of using the computer's autopilot. The *Eagle* landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[77]\n\n\nAs a Presbyterian elder, Aldrin was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: \"I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.\"[78] Using a kit given to him by his pastor,[79] he took communion and read Jesus's words from the New Testament's John 15:5, as Aldrin records it: \"I am the vine. You are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.\"[80] But he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8.[81] In 1970 he commented: \"It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.\"[82]\n\n\n\nAldrin calls out speeds in feet per second and distances in feet as Armstrong pilots *Eagle* to its lunar landing, establishing Tranquility Base, July 20, 1969.\nOn reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin said, \"Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind \u2013 be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo\u00a011 experience than by giving thanks to God.\"[83] Aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on the voyage back to Earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of the Old Testament's Psalm 8:3\u20134, as Aldrin records: \"When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him.\"[84] Photos of these liturgical documents reveal the conflict's development as Aldrin expresses faith.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aldrin saluting the Lunar Flag Assembly\nPreparations for the EVA began at 23:43.[69] Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, *Eagle* was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21.[69][86] Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface.[69] Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon were \"Beautiful view\", to which Armstrong asked \"Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here.\" Aldrin answered, \"Magnificent desolation.\"[87] Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the Lunar Flag Assembly, but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag while Armstrong photographed the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers.[88] During these experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, \"Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the *Hornet* on Thursday.\"[89] Aldrin replied, \"I look forward to that very much, sir.\"[89][90]\n\n\nAfter the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer, to detect moonquakes, and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample.[91] Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo\u00a011 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. \"As the sequence of lunar operations evolved,\" Aldrin explained, \"Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training.\"[92]\n\n\nAldrin reentered *Eagle* first but, as he tells it, before ascending the module's ladder he became the first person to urinate on the Moon.[93] With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5\u00a0lb) of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device.[94] Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the Apollo 1 flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space (who had died the previous year in a test flight accident), and Vladimir Komarov, the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations.[95] After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.[96]\n\n\n\n![A bootprint in gray dust.](image)Aldrin's lunar bootprint in a photo taken by him on July 21, 1969\nAt 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in *Eagle*'s ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard *Columbia* in lunar orbit.[69] After rendezvous with *Columbia*, the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and *Columbia* made its way back to Earth.[97] It splashed down in the Pacific 2,660\u00a0km (1,440\u00a0nmi) east of Wake Island at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24.[69][98] The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.[99]\n\n\nBringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered a possibility, albeit remote, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Hornet*,[100] where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine.[101] On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people.[102] An official state dinner that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President Richard Nixon honored each of them with the highest American civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction).[103][104]\n\n\nOn September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a joint session of Congress where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort.[105][106] The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries.[107] The last leg of the tour included Australia, South Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.[108][109]\n\n\nAfter Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the Space Shuttle. With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a colonel, saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971.[110] During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.[28]\n\n\n\n## Post-NASA activities[edit]\n\n\n### Aerospace Research Pilot School[edit]\n\n\n![Aldrin in an air force colonel's uniform, with five rows of ribbons and astronaut wings.](image)Aldrin as Commandant of the Air Force Test Pilot School\nAldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, but the job went to his West Point classmate Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr. Aldrin was made Commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified F-104 Starfighter to the edge of space.[111] Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker Alan Bean considered him well qualified for the job.[112]\n\n\nAldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General Robert M. White, who had earned his USAF astronaut wings flying the X-15. Aldrin's celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general.[113] There were two crashes at Edwards, of an A-7 Corsair II and a T-33. No people died, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.[114]\n\n\nAldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of depression, he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former.[115] He was hospitalized for depression at Wilford Hall Medical Center for four weeks.[116] His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini\u00a012 had contributed. His mother's father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them.[117] At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in his being ostracized socially.[115]\n\n\nIn February 1972, General George S. Brown paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force's interest in space diminished.[114] Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General Jimmy Doolittle, a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.[114]\n\n\n\n### Post retirement[edit]\n\n\nAldrin's father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a heart attack.[118] Aldrin's autobiographies, *Return to Earth* (1973) and *Magnificent Desolation* (2009), recounted his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA.[119][120][121] Encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job, Aldrin worked selling used cars, at which he had no talent.[122] Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct. Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor William Holden. Holden's girlfriend Stefanie Powers had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the 1976 TV movie version of *Return to Earth*. Aldrin was saddened by Holden's alcohol-related death in 1981.[123]\n\n\n\n### Bart Sibrel incident[edit]\n\n\nOn September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space.[124] When he arrived, Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him \"a coward, a liar, and a thief\" the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses said Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.[125][126]\n\n\n\n![Five men in blue jump suits pose with Aldrin in an olive jump suit on the runway in front of a white F-16](image)USAF Thunderbirds pilots pose for a photo with Aldrin prior to his flight at an air show in Melbourne, Florida, on April 2, 2017. Aldrin became the oldest person to fly with the Thunderbirds.[127]\n### Detached adapter panel sighting[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, while being interviewed for a Science Channel documentary titled *First on the Moon: The Untold Story*, Aldrin told an interviewer they had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO). The documentary makers omitted the crew's conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the Saturn\u00a0V rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on *The Howard Stern Show* on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, \"99.9 percent\" sure the object was the detached panel.[128][129] According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.[130]\n\n\n\n### Polar expedition[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand.[131] At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.[132][133]\n\n\n\n## Mission to Mars advocacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aldrin at a preview of the Destination: Mars experience\nAfter leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the University of North Dakota (UND)'s College of Aerospace Sciences at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought David Webb from NASA to serve as the department's first chair.[134] To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video \"Rocket Experience\", proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin's non-profit foundation, ShareSpace.[135] He is also a member of the Mars Society's Steering committee.[136]\n\n\nIn 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler.[137][138] Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.[139] In 1996 Aldrin founded Starcraft Boosters, Inc. (SBI) to design reusable rocket launchers.[140]\n\n\nIn December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in *The New York Times* criticizing NASA's objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a spacecraft \"limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability\" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was \"more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs\".[141]\n\n\nIn a June 2013 opinion piece in *The New York Times*, Aldrin supported a human mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon \"not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.\"[142] In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.[143]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aldrin addresses the crowd during the ceremony for his honorary promotion to brigadier general\nAldrin was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11.[144] He was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second DSM for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program,[144] and the Legion of Merit for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs.[144] During a 1966 ceremony marking the end of the Gemini program, Aldrin was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal by President Johnson at LBJ Ranch.[145] He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1970 for the Apollo\u00a011 mission.[146][147] Aldrin was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982.[148][149] He was also inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993,[150][151] the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2000,[152] and the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2008.[153]\nThe *Toy Story* character Buzz Lightyear was named in honor of Buzz Aldrin.[154]\n\n\nIn 1999, while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the lunar landing, Vice President Al Gore, who was also the vice-chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, presented the Apollo\u00a011 crew with the Smithsonian Institution's Langley Gold Medal for aviation. After the ceremony, the crew went to the White House and presented President Bill Clinton with an encased Moon rock.[155][156] The Apollo\u00a011 crew was awarded the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda in 2011. During the ceremony, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said, \"Those of us who have had the privilege to fly in space followed the trail they forged.\"[157][158]\n\n\n\n![see caption](image)Aldrin in 2001 wearing the Presidential Medal of Freedom he received in 1969\nThe Apollo\u00a011 crew were awarded the Collier Trophy in 1969. The National Aeronautic Association president awarded a duplicate trophy to Collins and Aldrin at a ceremony.[159] The crew was awarded the 1969 General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy.[160] The National Space Club named the crew the winners of the 1970 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy, awarded annually for the greatest achievement in spaceflight.[161] They received the international Harmon Trophy for aviators in 1970,[162][163] conferred to them by Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1971.[164] Agnew also presented them the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society in 1970. He told them, \"You've won a place alongside Christopher Columbus in American history\".[165] In 1970, the Apollo\u00a011 team were co-winners of the Iven C. Kincheloe award from the Society of Experimental Test Pilots along with Darryl Greenamyer who broke the world speed record for piston engine airplanes.[166] For contributions to the television industry, they were honored with round plaques on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[167]\n\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Aldrin to the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry.[168] Aldrin received the 2003 Humanitarian Award from Variety, the Children's Charity, which, according to the organization, \"is given to an individual who has shown unusual understanding, empathy, and devotion to mankind.\"[169] In 2006, the Space Foundation awarded him its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.[170]\n\n\nAldrin received honorary degrees from six colleges and universities,[28] and was named as the Chancellor of the International Space University in 2015.[171] He was a member of the National Space Society's Board of Governors,[172] and has served as the organization's chairman. In 2016, his hometown middle school in Montclair, New Jersey, was renamed Buzz Aldrin Middle School.[173] The Aldrin crater on the Moon near the Apollo\u00a011 landing site and Asteroid 6470 Aldrin are named in his honor.[148]\n\n\nIn 2019, Aldrin was awarded the Starmus Festival's Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication for Lifetime Achievement.[174] On his 93rd birthday he was honored by Living Legends of Aviation.[175] On May 5, 2023, he received an honorary promotion to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Air Force, as well as being made an honorary Space Force guardian.[176][177][178] On May 24, 2023, he received the 40 over 40 award by Monaco Voice, calling him \"Guardian of the Galaxy\".[179]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Marriages and children[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aldrin in 2001 with his third wife, Lois\nAldrin has been married four times. His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a Rutgers University and Columbia University alumna with a master's degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974.[180][181] His second wife was Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975,[182] and divorced in 1978. His third wife was Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988.[183] Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50\u00a0percent of their $475,000 bank account and $9,500 a month plus 30\u00a0percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000.[184][185] As of 2017,[update] he had one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons and one great-granddaughter.[186]\n\n\nIn 2018, Aldrin was involved in a legal dispute with his children Andrew and Janice and former business manager Christina Korp over their claims that he was mentally impaired through dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His children alleged that he made new friends who were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances.[187] In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family.[188] Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interest and that Korp was exploiting the elderly. He sought to remove Andrew's control of Aldrin's social media accounts, finances, and businesses. The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, several months before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo\u00a011 mission.[189]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2023, his 93rd birthday, Aldrin announced on Twitter that he had married for the fourth time, to his 63-year-old companion, Anca Faur.[190][175]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aldrin with President Donald Trump in July 2019\nAldrin is an active supporter of the Republican Party, headlining fundraisers for its members of Congress[191] and endorsing its candidates. He appeared at a rally for George W. Bush in 2004 and campaigned for Paul Rancatore in Florida in 2008, Mead Treadwell in Alaska in 2014[192] and Dan Crenshaw in Texas in 2018.[193] He appeared at the 2019 State of the Union Address as a guest of President Donald Trump.[194]\n\n\n\n### Freemasonry[edit]\n\n\nBuzz Aldrin is the first Freemason to set foot on the Moon.[195] Aldrin was initiated into Freemasonry at Oak Park Lodge No. 864 in Alabama and raised at Lawrence N. Greenleaf Lodge, No. 169 in Colorado.[196]\n\n\nBy the time Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface, he was a member of two Masonic lodges: Montclair Lodge No. 144 in New Jersey and Clear Lake Lodge No. 1417 in Seabrook, Texas, where he was invited to serve on the High Council and was ordained in the 33rd degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.[197]\n\n\nHe is also a member of York Rite and Arabia Shrine Temple of Houston.[198]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Aldrin confirmed to *Time* magazine that he had recently had a face-lift, joking that the g-forces he was exposed to in space \"caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention.\"[199]\n\n\nFollowing the 2012 death of his Apollo\u00a011 colleague Neil Armstrong, Aldrin said he was\n\n\n\n\n> ... deeply saddened by the passing\u00a0... I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew\u00a0...
