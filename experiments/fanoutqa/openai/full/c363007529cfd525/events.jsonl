He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*née* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montréal.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.[122] His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4×100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and László Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", Čavić said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] Čavić later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic.

It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched László Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fiancée Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012–13 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and László Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 × 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4×100 free\n | 4×200 free\n | 4×100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.[293] *im* is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America[293] and through Special Olympics International.[294] The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.[297][298] Phelps stated he hoped to work with his Foundation more after retirement from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[299]\n\n\nIn 2017, Phelps joined the board of Medibio, a company focused on diagnosis of mental health disorders.[300]\n\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[*citation needed*] However, Johnny Weissmuller is reported to have broken 67 official world records.[301]\n\n\nAll but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. As of July 23, 2023[update], he holds world records in two events (indicated in **bold**), after his last standing individual world record in 400m IM was broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Distance\n | Event\n | Time\n | Location\n | Date\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly | 1:54.92\n | Austin, Texas, US\n | March 30, 2001 | [302] |\n| 2\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly (2)\n | 1:54.58\n | Fukuoka, Japan\n | July 24, 2001 | [302] |\n| 3\n | 400 m\n | Individual medley | 4:11.09\n | Ft.

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

She is ranked first in the all-time Cross-Country World Cup rankings with 114 individual victories. Bjørgen is also the most successful sprinter in Cross-Country World Cup history, with 29 victories. She headed the medal table at the 2010 Winter Olympics by winning five medals, including three gold. A five-time Olympian, her five Olympic medals at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games brought her total number of medals up to a record 15, the most by any athlete in Winter Olympics history.[2]\n\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Bjørgen announced her retirement from cross–country skiing following the 2017–18 season.[3] In May 2020, she announced that she would return to competition with long-distance cross-country ski squad Team Ragde Eiendom, with a focus on competing in Vasaloppet in March 2021.[4]\n\n\nOn 28 April 2022, she announced the end of her career by also finishing her long-distance career.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMarit Bjørgen initially excelled at the sprint events, and seven victories in that event was enough to give her second place overall in the 2003–04 FIS Cross-Country World Cup season. However, in the 2004–05 season, Bjørgen became an accomplished distance skier.\n\n\nOn 19 March 2006 in Sapporo, Japan, Bjørgen claimed her second FIS World Cup title. Bjørgen led the overall World Cup by 66 points, ahead of Canada's Beckie Scott going into the final race of the season, the 2 x 7.5 km double pursuit. Scott needed to win the race and for Bjørgen to finish no higher than eighth to claim the title. Scott did win the race but Bjørgen came fourth, winning the crystal globe with 1036 points to Scott's 1020. Bjørgen also won the sprint title for the season, 6 points ahead of Norway's Ella Gjømle, making the 2005–06 season the fourth season in a row that Bjørgen has won the sprint title. Bjørgen finished the distance standings in fourth place, 108 points behind Russia's Julija Tchepalova.\n\n\n\n![](image)Marit Bjørgen in Otepää during the 2005–06 FIS Cross-Country World Cup\nBjørgen made the podium eight times during the 2005–06 season, six of them in first place, one second and one third place. Bjørgen now has 70 podium finishes, 46 of them in first place, 13 in second and 11 in third. 22 of her victories have been in the sprint, which is by far her most successful event. Seven of these victories were in the 2003–04 season and they have decreased in the past few seasons whilst her results in the other disciplines have improved. She has nine victories in the 10 km and seven in the pursuit. Her four other victories have been in longer races (30 km. and Vasaloppet).\n\n\nBjørgen has competed in the World Cup since 2000, when she finished the season in 53rd place overall and 48th in the sprints. The season after she finished the overall season in 32nd and the sprint in 36th. The season after however (2002–03) she won the sprint title and finished in 6th place overall. The 2003–04 season was Bjørgen's best season up until that time when she again won the sprint title, and came 11th in the distance standings, finishing the season in 2nd place behind Gabriella Paruzzi. In the 2004–05 season she won all the titles, and again won the overall and sprint title in 2005–06.\nIn 2011–12 she claimed the overall title for the third time, ahead of Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk.\n\n\nIn 2015 Bjørgen won her first Tour de Ski after nine attempts, defeating reigning champion and compatriot Therese Johaug by over one and a half minutes.[6]\n\n\n\n## World Championships[edit]\n\n\nBjørgen has eighteen World Championship gold medals, twelve of them individual. Her first gold medal in the World Championships came in the individual sprint in Val di Fiemme in 2003, where she also picked up a silver in the 4 × 5 km. She took three medals in Oberstdorf in 2005 in the 30 km classical, team sprint, and 4 × 5 km. She also won a silver in the 7.5 km + 7.5 km double pursuit and a bronze in the 10 km free in the same games. At the 2007 championships in Sapporo, Bjørgen won two bronze medals in team sprint (with Astrid Jacobsen) and in the 4 × 5 km. In Holmenkollen 2011 she won the individual sprint, the pursuit, the 10 km classical, the 4 × 5 km, and a silver in the 30km. In the 2013 Val di Fiemme World Championships she won the individual sprint, the double pursuit, the 4 x 5 km, the 30 km, and a silver in the 10 km freestyle.\n\n\nIn the World Championships 2011, held at Holmenkollen, Oslo, during February and March 2011, Bjørgen won gold medals in the Sprint, the 10-kilometre classic, the 15-kilometre pursuit and the 4 × 5-kilometre relay. She also finished second to Therese Johaug in the 30-kilometre freestyle.\n\n\n\n## Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marit Bjørgen celebrates sprint gold at the 2010 Olympics\nBjørgen had a disappointing Winter Olympics in Turin. She suffered from bronchitis a week before the games started and was prescribed antibiotics, then in the first race of the games, the 7.5 km + 7.5 km double pursuit, Bjørgen withdrew during the classic phase complaining of an upset stomach. In the next event, the team sprint, Bjørgen and Hilde G. Pedersen came fourth, and despite winning a silver in the 10 km, the remainder of the games went poorly for her. The next event was the 4 × 5 km relay, where Bjørgen took the anchor leg and finished in fifth place, the first time since 1988 that Norway had failed to reach the podium in the women's relay. In the individual sprint, Bjørgen failed to make the semi-finals, and both Bjørgen and Pedersen decided not to compete in the 30 km and returned home to Norway. Afterwards she was quoted as saying she was \"sick and tired of Pragelato and OL (Olympic games)\".[7]\n\n\nHowever Bjørgen recovered to win the 45 km Vasaloppet from Oxberg to Mora on 4 March, eight days after the end of the Winter Olympics. Bjørgen broke away with Hilde Pedersen and Vibeke Skofterud after only 10 km, but Skofterud could not keep up with the pace and fell back, and Bjørgen powered away from Pedersen with a few kilometres left, winning in a time of 2:17:53, 1:22 ahead of Pedersen and 3:23 ahead of Petra Majdič of Slovenia. Winning a purse of 88,000 SEK and also winning two of the three sprints during the race to add another 10,000 SEK. Then three days later on 7 March, Bjørgen finished second in the individual sprint event in Borlänge, Sweden.\n\n\nIn the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Bjørgen finished third in the 10 km freestyle event, before winning her first Olympic gold medal in the sprint. In the sprint she was up against a very strong field, consisting of Petra Majdič of Slovenia who had taken a serious fall earlier in the day during qualification, and Justyna Kowalczyk of Poland who was leading the overall World Cup standings coming into the race. Bjørgen won her second gold in the 2 × 7.5-kilometre on 19 February 2010. Bjørgen was also part of the 4 × 5 km relay team that won gold on 25 February 2010, finishing with enough time to cross the line with a large Norwegian flag given to her by a spectator near the finish, and jumping over the finish line. She closed out her trip in Vancouver by taking silver 0.3 seconds behind Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk in the women's 30 km event.\n\n\nBjørgen won gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in the 15 km skiathlon, the Team sprint and the 30km freestyle race. These three Olympic medals brought her total up to ten, equaling the record for most Winter Olympic medals held by a woman, already achieved by Stefania Belmondo and Raisa Smetanina; but of the three record holders at the time, Bjørgen had the most golds.[8]\n\n\nBjørgen is a five-time Olympian, having competed in every Winter Olympics since Salt Lake City in 2002 where she won her first silver medal. At the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang she won her 11th–15th Olympic medals, the highest number of medals won by any athlete in Winter Olympics history.[9]\n\n\n\n## Holmenkollen[edit]\n\n\nBjørgen won the women's 30 km event at the Holmenkollen ski festival in 2005. She won the same event five years later in 2010. This was the first World Cup event to be held at Holmenkollen since the completion of the new ski jumping hill. For her win in both the 30 km and the sprint event, along with her successes at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Bjørgen was awarded the Holmenkollen medal. On 11 March 2018, Bjørgen won a record seventh 30 km in Holmenkollen.[10]\n\n\n\n## International Fair Play Mecenate Award[edit]\n\n\nBjørgen was awarded the International Fair Play Mecenate award for 2014. The jury of the Fair Play Mecenate consists of members from all continents and represents the international sports media and various international sports organisations. The jury states that the Fair Play Mecenate is awarded Marit Bjørgen \"for the particular ethical and fair play behaviour that you have always had both in your agonistic career and in your demonstrations of great sportsmanship and solidarity\".[11]\n\n\n\n## Asthma medications[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2009–2010 season Bjørgen had a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) issued by the International Ski Federation (FIS) for the asthma medication Symbicort which contained substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited list.[12] Bjørgen continued to use the medication over the 2010 Olympics and was strongly criticized by Justyna Kowalczyk who accused her of doping.[13][14] As of September 2011[update] athletes no longer need a TUE for Symbicort, and the drug can be used by any athlete but only in a restricted dose.[15]\n\n\n\n## Cross-country skiing results[edit]\n\n\nAll results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).[16]\n\n\n\n### Olympic

Andrianov is the third athlete (male or female) in cumulative Olympic medals after Phelps's 28 and Larisa Latynina's 18. Andrianov won the most medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics with 6 individual medals and one team medal. Within the sport of Men's Artistic Gymnastics, he also holds the men's record for most individual Olympic medals (12) and shares the male record for most individual Olympic gold medals in gymnastics (6) with Boris Shakhlin and Dmitry Bilozerchev (the latter of which only if you count the 1984 Alternate Olympics). In many other rankings among all-time medal winners at the Olympic, World, and European levels, he ranks very high (for example, he is second only to Vitaly Scherbo in total individual medal counts at either the gold level or any level at the combined Olympic and World levels as well as at the combined Olympic, World, and European levels), easily making him one of the most decorated gymnasts of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and Olympic career[edit]\n\n\nAndrianov entered the Children and Youth Sports School of the Burevestnik sports society in Vladimir at age 11. His first international success came in 1971 at the European Championships in Madrid, where he won two gold medals. Between 1971 and 1980 he won many international gymnastics competitions, including the Olympic Games, world championships and European championships.[1]\n\n\nAndrianov's first Olympic medal was a gold in the 1972 floor competition. He dominated the 1976 gymnastics competition, winning four golds, including the all-around, two silvers, and a bronze.[3] These medals included golds in the floor exercises, rings, and vault, as well as a prized gold in the 1976 all-around. His record of four gymnastic golds at a single games stood until Vitaly Scherbo won six other medals in 1992.[4]\n\n\nAndrianov took the Olympic Oath for athletes at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. In the gymnastics competition, he won two more golds, two silvers, and a bronze.[3] Andrianov's golds in that Olympics were in the vault and team competition, his silvers were in the all-around and floor exercises, and his bronze medal was in the horizontal bar.[5] He retired shortly after that year's Olympics.[3]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nAndrianov married another famous Soviet gymnast, two-time Olympic champion Lyubov Burda. Together they worked as children's gymnastics coaches, with Andrianov being the head coach of the Soviet national men's junior team in 1981–1992. In 1990–1992 he also coached the Soviet senior gymnastics team, and in 1990–1993 headed the Soviet and later the Russian Gymnastics Federation.[1]\n\n\nIn 2001, Andrianov was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.[1] Between 1994 and 2002 he coached the Japan Olympic gymnastics team, on the invitation of his former rival, Mitsuo Tsukahara. Andrianov coached Tsukahara's son, Naoya Tsukahara, and both father and son credit him with raising Naoya's skills and confidence to equip him to compete at the international level.[6] In 2002 he became the director of gymnastics at the N.G. Tolkachyov Specialized Children and Youth sports school in Vladimir, where he first began the sport as a youth.[1]\n\n\n\n## Illness and death[edit]\n\n\nIn his final years, Andrianov developed the degenerative neurological disorder multiple system atrophy and in his final months was unable to move his arms or legs or talk.[7] Andrianov died on 21 March 2011 at the age of 58,[8] in his hometown of Vladimir.[9] Russia's national gymnastic team coach, Alexander Alexandrov, called the death \"tragic\", but stated that he had been ill for a long time.[9]\n\n\n\n## Achievements (non-Olympic)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Event\n | AA\n | Team\n | FX | PH | RG | VT | PB | HB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1971** | European Championships | 3rd |  | 3rd | 1st | 2nd | 1st | 2nd |  |\n| USSR Championships |  |  |  |  |  | 1st |  |  |\n| **1972** | USSR Championships | 1st |  | 1st | 2nd | 2nd | 2nd | 2nd | 1st\n |\n| USSR Cup | 1st |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **1973** | European Championships | 2nd |  | 1st |  | 2nd | 1st | 2nd |  |\n| University Games | 1st | 1st | 1st | 1st |  | 1st |  |  |\n| USSR Championships | 1st |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **1974** | World Championships | 2nd | 2nd |  | 2nd | 1st | 2nd | 2nd |  |\n| USSR Championships | 1st |  | 1st | 1st |  | 3rd | 1st |  |\n| USSR Cup | 1st |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **1975** | World Cup | 1st |  | 2nd | 2nd |  |  | 1st |  |\n| European Championships | 1st |  | 1st | 2nd |  | 1st | 1st | 1st\n |\n| USSR Championships |  |  | 1st |  |  |  |  | 1st\n |\n| **1977** | World Cup | 1st |  | 1st |  | 1st | 2nd | 1st |  |\n| **1978** | World Championships | 1st | 2nd |  |  | 1st | 2nd | 2nd |  |\n| USSR Cup | 3rd |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **1979** | World Championships |  | 1st |  |  |  | 2nd |  |  |\n| USSR Championships | 3rd |  |  |  |  | 3rd |  |  |\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Order of Lenin\n* Order of the Badge of Honour\n* Order of the Red Banner of Labour\n* Medal \"For Labour Valour\"\n* Lenin Komsomol Prize\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of Olympic medal leaders in men's gymnastics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Evans, Hilary; Gjerde, Arild; Heijmans, Jeroen; Mallon, Bill; et al. \"Nikolay Andrianov\". *Olympics at Sports-Reference.com*.

He then anchored Norway to gold in the 4 × 7.5 km relay. This was the second time that Norway had won a title in this event, with the other being at the 2002 Winter Olympics (also anchored by Bjørndalen). With this victory he became the second most decorated Winter Olympian of all time and one of only two athletes to win 11 medals at the Winter Olympics.

He won the two following individual competitions. After competing in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Sapporo 2007, he missed several Biathlon World Cup events; after missing eight competitions altogether Bjørndalen finished second in the overall standings, after German Michael Greis.\n\n\n\n### 2008–09 World Cup season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008–09 World Cup season results  \n |\n| --- |\n| No. | World Cup location |  | Individual | Sprint | Pursuit | Mass start | Relay | Mixed relay |\n| 1 | Östersund, Sweden | 24 | 4 | 2 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | 12 | 2 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 3 | Hochfilzen, Austria | 14 | DNS | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 4 | Oberhof, Germany | — | 23 | — | 3 | 3 | —\n |\n| 5 | Ruhpolding, Germany | — | 1 | 1 | — | 1 | —\n |\n| 6 | Antholz-Anterselva, Italy | — | DNS | DNS | 5 | — | —\n |\n| WCH | Pyeongchang, South Korea | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 7 | Vancouver, Canada | 18 | 2 | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 8 | Trondheim, Norway | — | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | —\n |\n| 9 | Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia | — | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | —\n |\n| *Key:\"—\" denotes discipline not held; DNS—Did not start; WCH—World Championships*[1] |\n\n\nBjørndalen started off the season suffering from the effects of long-term illness, but still placed second in both of the pursuit events. He missed the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen, focusing on training instead. After the break, he returned with victories in both the sprint and pursuit events in Ruhpolding and a third place in the mass start in Oberhof.\n\n\nAt the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, during the men's 12.5 km pursuit, Bjørndalen with at least 15 other competitors accidentally skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap due to the bad marking. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of skiing beside it, which was the right way. A jury meeting decided to give all these athletes a one-minute time penalty, following a complaint from the Russian team. However, another complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result.[22] Along with Bjørndalen's first ever 20 km individual World Championship title, he won four out of six possible gold medals (10 km sprint, 12.5 km pursuit, 20 km individual and the 4 × 7.5 km relay).\n\n\nAfter the World Championships Bjørndalen came second in the sprint in Vancouver, he took over the world cup overall lead. He followed up with a second place, and two victories at the events in Granåsen, Trondheim (the latter being a mass start where he shot clean). He secured his sixth overall win in the last sprint of the season, in Khanty-Mansiysk where he placed second. In the following event (a pursuit), he was beaten at the finish line by teammate Emil Hegle Svendsen, but won the pursuit cup.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen grew up on a farm in Simostranda, the fourth of five children: one of his siblings is fellow biathlete Dag Bjørndalen. Both brothers were part of the Norwegian team that took the silver medal in the men's relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics.[7]\n\n\nBjørndalen resides in the village of Obertilliach, Austria. He also used to live in Toblach, Italy, with Italian-Belgian biathlete Nathalie Santer. They started dating in 1998 and married on 27 May 2006. On 4 October 2012, they filed for divorce by mutual consent.\n\n\nIn April 2016, along with announcing that he will continue his career until the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Bjørndalen confirmed that he was in a relationship with Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva, and that she was pregnant with the couple's first child.[23] On 7 July 2016, they married in Sjusjøen, Norway.[24] Their daughter Xenia was born on 1 October 2016.[25]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2018 Bjørndalen announced his retirement from biathlon. Bjørndalen ended his Olympic career after being left off Norway's 2018 team for PyeongChang, thus ending a bid for a seventh Winter Games.\n\n\n\n## Endorsement[edit]\n\n\nHis close to one hundred individual World Cup wins makes Ole Bjorndalen the most winning winter sports athlete of all time. He brings the same focused intensity and spirit of victory to the brands and products who sponsor him. Ole Bjorndalen cooperates with big and renowned brands. He has been Certina's loyal ambassador since 2011,[26] InstaForex brand ambassador since 2015.[27] Among sports equipment brands that he promotes are Madshus,[28] Odlo,[29] and Casco.[30]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nOle Einar Bjørndalen won the Aftenposten Gold Medal in 1998. He was named the Norwegian Sportsperson of the Year in 2002 and 2014. For his accomplishments in biathlon and cross-country skiing, Bjørndalen received the Egebergs Ærespris in 2002. Bjørndalen was also awarded with the Fearnleys olympic honorary award in 2002. He was voted Best Male Athlete of 2002 by International Sports Press Association. Ole Einar Bjørndalen was nominated for Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2003.[31] He came second, only lost to Lance Armstrong that year, who was later rescinded.

His first podium place in the FIS Cross-Country World Cup came in Kuopio 25 November 2001, where he finished in 2nd place in the 10 km freestyle event. One month later he once again came in 2nd place, this time losing out to Per Elofsson in the 30 km freestyle mass-start event in Ramsau, Austria.\n\n\nOn 18 November 2006 Bjørndalen made history by becoming the first male biathlete to win a FIS Cross-Country World Cup event in the Swedish town Gällivare. Bjørndalen won the 15 km freestyle event.[38] In 2007 his countryman, and fellow biathlete Lars Berger won the 15 km cross-country event at the World Championship in 2007.\nBjørndalen has twice finished on the podium in cross-country world cup relays for Norway: first in Beitostølen in 2003, where his team finished third, and secondly in La Clusaz in France in 2006, where Norway came in 2nd place.[39] In total Bjørndalen has been on the podium 5 times in the Cross-Country World Cup.\n\n\nIn addition, Bjørndalen has won FIS events in cross-country twice. His first win was in 1997 in the 30 kilometre freestyle event in Valdres, Norway, and the second was in the 10 km freestyle event in Beitostølen, Norway in 2006. He has also two 2nd places in a FIS-event: in the 15 km freestyle event in Misurina, Italy in 1998 and in the 10 km freestyle event at Beitostølen in 2004. In addition to this, Bjørndalen has one third place in a FIS event, in the 10 km freestyle at Beitostølen in 2001. Following his two Cross-Country World Cup podium finishes in the 2001–02 season, ahead of the 2002 Winter Olympics he stated that he was hoping to become the first competitor to take Olympic medals in both biathlon and cross-country skiing,[7] however Bjørndalen missed out on a cross-country medal, finishing 5th in the 30 km freestyle cross-country race in Salt Lake City on 9 February 2002.[39] He won Skarverennet in 2006 and 2007, and came in 2nd after Petter Northug in 2008.\n\n\n\n## Other victories[edit]\n\n\nOle Einar Bjørndalen won the Beach Volleyball Championship at Laguna Beach in 2001.[40] Bjørndalen has won the World Team Challenge biathlon exhibition event in Gelsenkirchen (held at the Veltins-Arena, the home ground of football club Schalke 04) in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006.

Shooting[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen is a solid shooter, but is generally outside the top twenty marksmen. Bjørndalen finished the 2005–06 season with a shooting percentage of 84%, hitting 292 out of 345 possible targets, that placed him in 36th position for shooting accuracy. His shooting record for both prone and standing were practically identical, 146/172 in the prone and 146/173 in the standing position. In the individual disciplines, he shot 92% in the individual, 89% in the sprint, 96% in the pursuit, 93% in the mass start and 96% in the relay.\n\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Bjørndalen was the 16th best shot with an 85% success rate, the second best Norwegian behind Egil Gjelland. He hit 331 targets out of a possible 364. His prone like most biathletes was much better than his standing shoot, he hit 169/180 (92%) in the prone and 163/184 (81%) in the standing. He had an average of 88% in the individual, sprint and relay, a 91% hit rate in the mass start but only 79% in the pursuit. During his career in 1999–00 he averaged 82%, in 2000–01 78%, 2001–02 74%, 2002–03 86% and in 2003–04 he hit 80% of the targets, however in those five years his standing shoot was the same or better than his prone shoot. In comparison, his greatest rival Raphaël Poirée averaged 87% in 2004–05 and 86% in 2005–06. Nikolay Kruglov was the best shot in 2004–05 with a 91% success rate, with Ricco Groß in second with 89%, and in 2005 Julien Robert was best with a 93% average and Groß again second with 91%.[1]\n\n\n\n### Shooting statistics[edit]\n\n\nStatistics sourced from the International Biathlon Union.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Shooting\n | 2004–05\n | 2005–06\n | 2006–07\n | 2007–08\n | 2008–09\n | 2009–10\n | 2010–11\n | 2011–12\n | 2012–13\n | 2013–14\n | 2014–15\n | 2015–16\n | 2016–17\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall | 85% | 84% | 84% | 83% | 85% | 83% | 86% | 80%\n |  |  | 85%\n | 84%\n | 85%\n |\n| Prone position | 89% | 84% | 85% | 84% | 85% | 87% | 89% | 85%\n |  |  | 88%\n | 84%\n | 86%\n |\n| Standing position | 81% | 84% | 84% | 82% | 86% | 80% | 83% | 75%\n |  |  | 82%\n | 84%\n | 84%\n |\n\n\nand[45]\n\n\n\n## Cross-country skiing results[edit]\n\n\nAll results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).[2]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Year \n |  Age \n |  15 km \n |  Pursuit \n |  30 km \n |  50 km \n |  Sprint \n |  4 × 10 km  relay \n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | *28* | — | — | 5 | — | — | — |\n\n\n### World Championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Year \n |  Age \n |  15 km  individual \n |  30 km  skiathlon \n |  50 km  mass start \n |  Sprint \n |  4 × 10 km  relay \n |  Team  sprint \n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005 | *31* | 11 | — | — | — | — | — |\n| 2007 | *33* | 13 | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n\n### World Cup[edit]\n\n\n#### Season standings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Season \n |  Age \n | Discipline standings\n | Ski Tour standings\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall\n | Distance\n | Long Distance\n | Sprint\n | NordicOpening\n | Tour deSki\n | World CupFinal\n |\n| 1999 | *25* | 63 | — | 48 | 89 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2002 | *28* | 29 | — | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2003 | *29* | 100 | — | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2004 | *30* | 108 | 69 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2005 | *31* | 64 | 39 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2007 | *33* | 46 | 25 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2008 | *34* | 81 | 49 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2011 | *37* | 153 | 97 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n#### Individual podiums[edit]\n\n\n* 1 victory – (1 WC)\n* 3 podiums – (3 WC)\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Season\n | Date\n | Location\n | Race\n | Level\n | Place\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **2001–02** | 25 November 2001 | ![Finland](image) Kuopio, Finland | 10 km Individual F | World Cup | 2nd\n |\n| 2 | 22 December 2001 | ![Austria](image) Ramsau, Austria | 30 km Mass Start F | World Cup | 2nd\n |\n| 3 | **2006–07** | 18 November 2006 | ![Sweden](image) Gällivare, Sweden | 15 km Individual F | World Cup | **1st** |\n\n\n#### Team podiums[edit]\n\n\n* 3 podiums – (3 RL)\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Season\n | Date\n | Location\n | Race\n | Level\n | Place\n | Teammates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **1998–99** | 29 November 1998 | ![Finland](image) Muonio, Finland | 4 × 10 km Relay F | World Cup | 2nd | Skjeldal / Dæhlie / Hetland |\n| 2 | **2003–04** | 23 November 2003 | ![Norway](image) Beitostølen, Norway | 4 × 10 km Relay C/F | World Cup | 3rd | Estil / Bjonviken / Andresen |\n| 3 | **2006–07** | 17 December 2006 | ![France](image) La Clusaz, France | 4 × 10 km Relay C/F | World Cup | 2nd | Hetland / Rønning / Northug |\n\n\n## Equipment[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen uses Madshus skis, boots and poles.\nHe uses Rottefella NNN bindings.\nHis gloves and base layer are from Odlo, and he uses Casco glasses.[46]\n\n\nDuring the off-season in 2006 Bjørndalen was testing a new ski boot that had a high heel in the Torsby ski tunnel with boot manufacturers Madshus. The theory is that it forces the knee more forward for better position and it incorporates the large gluteal muscles.[47]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of multiple Winter Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* All placings and results are sourced by the International Biathlon Union's searchable results database: \"IBU Datacenter\".

Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. (If they were, Ray Ewry would be second on the list with 10 gold). It includes top-three placings in 1896 and 1900, before medals were awarded for top-three placings. The Olympics listed for each athlete **only include games in which they won medals**. See the particular article on the athlete for more details on when and for what nation an athlete competed. More medals are available in some events than others, and the number of events in which medals are available overall has changed over time. \n\n\n\nNames in **bold** denote people that have competed

record for most titles won. It includes titles won in 1896 and 1900, before gold medals were awarded for first place. All record-holders have competed at Summer Games rather than Winter Games.\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps, holder of the record for the most Olympic gold medals, with one of his medals at the 2008

He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*née* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montréal.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle.

Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4×100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and László Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", Čavić said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] Čavić later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic. It goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest Olympian of all time, he's maybe the greatest athlete of all time. He's the greatest racer who ever walked the planet. (2008)\n |\n| —Mark Spitz (on Phelps winning his 7th gold medal)[159] |\n\n\nPhelps's seventh gold medal of the Games tied Mark Spitz's record for gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, set in the 1972 Olympics. It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched László Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fiancée Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012–13 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and László Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 × 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4×100 free\n | 4×200 free\n | 4×100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming.

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

He was called the \"Flying Finn\" or the \"Phantom Finn\", as he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.\n\n\nBorn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals,[3] although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.\n\n\nStruggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.\n\n\nNurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the \"even pace\" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi (second from right) with  \nhis family in 1924\nNurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine.[4] Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively.[5] In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932.[5] The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb.[4] They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day.[6] By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02.[4] Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later.[5] The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room.[4] Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery.[5] Although he stopped running actively,[4] he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku.[7] He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.[7]\n\n\nAt 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to \"have run Finland onto the map of the world\" at the 1912 Summer Olympics.[8] He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later.[6] Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters.[4] In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres.[9] Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics.[4] He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab.

Ahlberg & Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919.[4] During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions.[4] After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.[4]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1920 Olympic trials\nIn the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand.[9] Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers,[9] despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial.[10] As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice.[4] Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs.[4] Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection.[9] In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (*alikersantti*).[4] On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and went on to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.[8][11]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\n### 1920–1924 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1924 Summer Olympics\nNurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.[9] He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics.[8] He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute,[12] the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku.[5] Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.[9]\n\n\nBuoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously.[13] Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance.[14] He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless.[13] Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921.[15] In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m.[14] A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile.[14] His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since.[8] Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record.[16] After excelling in mathematics,[17] Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.[5][9]\n\n\nNurmi's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day.[16] On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances.[18] In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster.[18] His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe,[18] still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds.[19] The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m.[18] Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace.[20][21] Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass.[20] The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel.[18] On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.[18]\n\n\nIn the cross country events, the heat of 45 °C (113 °F),[22] caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race.[18] Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers.[18] One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious.[23] Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital.[24][25] Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half.[18] As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward.[26] An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line.[26] After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold.[18][26] Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.[27]\n\n\nIn the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth.[18] Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him.[18][28] After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years.[28] He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.[29]\n\n\n\n### U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi, right, and Joie Ray, left, with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge during Nurmi's 1925 U.S. tour\nIn early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January.[30] His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris.[30] Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances.[30] Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances.[30] He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich.[30][31] Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards.[32] Although he hated losing more than anything,[33] Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich.[31] The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.[34] Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.[35]\n\n\nNurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems.[9] He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively.[9] As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland.[9] In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm,[29] despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide.[36] Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again.[37] In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer.[38] This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m.[32] In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna.[39] Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics.[40] At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances.[41] He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before,[41] the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.[42]\n\n\nAt the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight.[43] Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase.[43] He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot.[43] Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused.[43] In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead.[43] Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver.[43] Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day.[43] Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance.[43] On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record.[43] Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.[43]\n\n\n\n### Move to longer distances[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi checks his stopwatch in 1928\nNurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\"[8] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin.[15] Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945.[44] In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn.[45] He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile.[46][47] Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925,[46] and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him.[48] In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km.[15] In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles.[49][50] He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes.[49] Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\"[51]\n\n\nIn April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation.[52] The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing,[52] but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch,[53] and the Associated Press wrote that \"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\"[52] A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism.[53] Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.[54]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi running his first and only \"Short\" marathon 40.2 km (25.0 mi)at the 1932 Olympic trials in Viipuri\nOn 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25.0 mi) in 2:22:03.8 – on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00,[55] just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes.[56] Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon.[57] Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon.[55] The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon.[58] *The Guardian* reported that \"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\"[23] and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury.[8] Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.[59]\n\n\n\n### 1932 Olympics and later career[edit]\n\n\nLess than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles.[60] Sigfrid Edström, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4.[61] and 7/30/1932.[62] [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edström and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi's ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.][63][64]\nEdström stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case.[60] The AP called this \"one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history\", and wrote that the Games would now be \"like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.\"[65] Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki.[66] Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931.[65] The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be \"unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.\"[67] The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\"[68]\n\n\nOn the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted.[69] Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition.[69] However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially.[69] Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier,[70] Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes.[8] The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote.[71] However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm.[71] Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status,[72] and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden.[73] A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international.[74] After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.[72]\n\n\nNurmi refused to turn professional,[75] and continued running as an amateur in Finland.[8] In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926.[76][77] At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost.[78] The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code.[78] With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite.[78] Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934.[8] Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career.[79] In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.[80]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in his men's clothing store in Helsinki in 1939\nWhile active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods.[81] Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him.[81] Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him.[81] After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.[16] In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden.[82] However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games.[16][83] In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki.[84] It became a popular tourist attraction,[85] and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi.[86] The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction.[84] As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each.[87] Within five years, he was rated a millionaire.[85] His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price.[59] Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.[88]\n\n\nIn February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé Taisto Mäki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause.[8] The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and Mäki.[89] Hoover welcomed the two as \"ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.\"[90] While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar Höckert, had been killed in action.[91] Nurmi left for Finland in late April,[92] and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff.[93] Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (*ylikersantti*) and later to a sergeant first class (*vääpeli*).[93]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi lights the Olympic Flame in 1952\nIn 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.[88] His appearance astonished the spectators, and *Sports Illustrated* wrote that \"his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.\"[94] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower.[59] In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.[95]\n\n\nNurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman,[9] but his interest in running never died.[96] He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War.[97] Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club.[98] In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: \"The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'\"[99] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something.[100] Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala.[96] He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Paavo Nurmi in the early 1970s\nAlthough he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964,[101] Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews.[102] On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer.[103] Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art.[104] He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral.[28] Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: \"People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.\"[59] At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin,[9] Konsta Jylhä's *Vaiennut viulu* (*The Silenced Violin*) was played during the ceremony.[105] Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.[106]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in a calisthenic pose\nNurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907–1968) from 1932 to 1935.[84] Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, \"[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.\"[107] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a \"self-made\" businessman.[87] Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed \"uneasy\".[87] Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career.[87] As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father's time.[87] In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the \"three Olavis\" (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.[87] Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon \"Vampira\", was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi's niece.[108] However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.[108]\n\n\nNurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924.[109] He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21.[109] Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be \"taciturn\", \"stony-faced\" and \"stubborn\".[9] He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his \"sarcastic sense of humour\" among the small circles he knew.[9] Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak,[110] Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media,[9] stating later on his 75th birthday, \"[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.\"[87] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi \"is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.\"[111] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him *Suuri vaikenija* (The Great Silent One),[112] and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: \"Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer.[38][113] Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: \"Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.\"[38] Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: \"Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.\"[114] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that \"in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.\"[115] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: \"He grabbed ahold of me — he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!\"[116]\n\n\nNurmi's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", the \"King of Runners\" and \"Peerless Paavo\",[8][117][118] while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine.[119] One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi \"a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.\"[120] Phil Cousineau noted that \"his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.\"[120] Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a \"freakish heart\" with a very low pulse rate.[121] During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have \"the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.\"[118]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Wäinö Aaltonen and Paavo Nurmi with Aaltonen's bronze statue of Nurmi in the Ateneum museum in the late 1930s\nNurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km; a record in running.[15][122] He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58.[87] His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s.[15] Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008.[123] Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.[124] *Time* selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996,[125] and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.[126]\n\n\nNurmi introduced the \"even pace\" strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race.[127] He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\"[118] Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\"[128] Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running.[129][130] Peter Lovesey wrote in *The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners* that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\"[81] Cordner Nelson, founder of *Track & Field News*, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man’s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi's achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Zátopek chanted \"I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!\" when he trained as a child,[87] and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi's methods.[131] Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died.[115] Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could \"repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.\"[132] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games.[132] Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem *Olympic Laurel* that included a verse on Nurmi.[133] In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse *Nurmi* won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.[133]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi on the ten-mark bill\nA bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925.[134] The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.[134] In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship *Vasa* when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961.[135] Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work *Löpare* (*Runners*) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide.[133] *Boken om Nurmi* (*The Book about Nurmi*), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman.[133] Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939,[136] while Finnair named its first DC-8 *Paavo Nurmi* in 1969.[137] Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.[133]\n\n\nPaavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest.[138] In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957.[139] Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi.[140] A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987.[141] The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively.[141] The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993.[141] In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the *Paavo Nurmi Stadium*.[133] Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m.[142] In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel *Marathon Man* as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi.[143] The opera on Nurmi, *Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.*, written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000.[144] In a 2005 episode of *The Simpsons*, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.[145] The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.[146][147]\n\n\n\n## Career summary (1920–34)[edit]\n\n\n### Seasons[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi beats Wide to a win in Stockholm, July 1926.\n![refer to

He was the most successful competitor at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. This achievement set a record that lasted for 36 years, until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial.[1][2] *Swimming World Magazine* named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was born on February 10, 1950, in Modesto, California, the first of three children[3] of Lenore Sylvia (Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed \"Sklotkovick\", were from Russia.[4][5][6] When Spitz was two years old, his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. \"You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide,\" Lenore Spitz told a reporter for *Time* in 1968.[3] At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored six other Olympic medal winners.\n\n\nAt only 10, Spitz held one world age-group record and 17 national records.[7] When Spitz was 14, his family moved to Santa Clara, where he joined the Santa Clara Swim Club and was trained by coach George F. Haines.[7] From 1964 to 1968, Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance.[*citation needed*] In 1966 at age 16, he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 total AAU titles. The following year, Spitz emerged on the world swimming stage when he set his first world record at a small California meet with a time of 4:10.60 in the 400-meter freestyle.[8]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Maccabiah Games[edit]\n\n\nSpitz swam in his first international competition at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At age 15 and weighing 130 pounds, he won four gold medals in Tel Aviv—the 400 m freestyle, the 1,500 freestyle, the 400 m individual medley, and the 800 m freestyle relay, and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games.[3][9][10]\n\n\nHe returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete, at the 1969 Maccabiah Games. This time, he won six gold medals.[*citation needed*] He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.[11]\n\n\nIn 1985, Spitz lit the torch to open the 1985 Maccabiah Games.[12]\n\n\nIn 2005, he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 2005 Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games, with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.\n\n\n\n### Pan American Games[edit]\n\n\nHe won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira, won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### 1968 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1968 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz c. 1968\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1968 Mexico City |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:31.7\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:52.3\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 56.40\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 53.00\n |\n\n\nSpitz was already the holder of ten world records, and he brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33.[13] In addition, Spitz finished second to fellow American Doug Russell in the 100-meter butterfly. He lost to Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.[14] Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance.\n\n\n\n### College training[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance. in January 1969, he decided to attend Indiana University[2] to train with legendary Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman,[15] who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman \"the biggest decision of my life (and) the best.\"[16] While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972.\n\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Mark the Shark\" by his teammates.\n\n\n\n### 1972 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics and 1972 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz at the 1972 Olympics\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1972 Munich |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 2:00.70 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:26.42 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:52.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 54.27 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:35.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 51.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley relay  | 3:48.16 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz was back to repeat his quest for the six gold medals. He did even better, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Furthermore, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Spitz was originally reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing that he would not win the gold medal. Minutes before the race, he confessed on the pool deck to ABC's Donna de Varona, \"I know I say I don't want to swim before every event, but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure.\" Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacket worn by Mark Spitz during the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nSpitz is one of five Olympians to win nine or more career gold medals: Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis also have nine;[18] only Phelps has won more with 23. Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Phelps broke the record at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nAfter he had completed his events, Spitz left Munich early as a result of the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and later murdered by Palestinian terrorists.[19][20] Being Jewish himself, there was concern among the Olympic authorities that Spitz would become a likely target for the Palestinians and he was escorted to London for his own safety.[21][22][23] It is believed that he was escorted out of the country by US Marines stationed in West Germany.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was only 22 years old.[24]\n\n\nAt age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after filmmaker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying.[25] Spitz's comeback attempt made the cover of *Parade* and was also reported on in *Sports Illustrated* and *Esquire*.[26] Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz was two seconds slower than the Olympic standard and failed to qualify.[25]\n\n\nIn 1999, Spitz ranked No. 33 on *ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes*, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.[27]\n\n\n\n## Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\n* International Swimming Hall of Fame, Inducted 1977.[28]\n* International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 1979.[29]\n* United States Olympic Hall of Fame, Inducted 1983.[30]\n* Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Inducted 1990.[31]\n* San Jose Sports Hall of Fame, inducted Wednesday, November 14, 2007.[32][33]\n* National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007.[34]\n* Long Beach City College Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007[35]\n* Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame[36]\n\n\n## Film and television career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz retired from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while he was still a household name due to his athletic success.[37]\n\n\nA poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable.[38]\n\n\nIn Spitz's TV debut, he appeared as himself in a skit as a dentist on a Bob Hope special that aired October 5, 1972. In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* and *The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour*. On the TV drama *Emergency!*, he portrayed Pete Barlow, whose wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy) is accidentally shot by a handgun in an overfull drawer. He also appeared briefly on *The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast* of California Governor Ronald Reagan in September 1973.\n\n\nSpitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[39] In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in *Challenge of a Lifetime*. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure[38] except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.[38]\n\n\n\n### Narration[edit]\n\n\nSpitz narrated *Freedom's Fury*, a 2006 Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's Blood in the Water match against the Soviet Union during the Revolution of 1956—considered among the most famous water polo matches.[40] The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu,[41] and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.[40]\n\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\nHe appeared in an advertisement for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption \"I always drink it--is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers.\"\n\n\nIn 1974, he was in a number of Schick razors commercials.[42] In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation.\n\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS.[43] Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard's first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996 and 2004). The ad was entitled \"Shock\".[44] Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the \"Orbitrek Elite\" fitness workout.[45]\n\n\nIn 2012, Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2019 commercial, Spitz pitched a personal EKG device by KardiaMobile.[46]\n\n\nIn 2022, Spitz endorsed the health supplement Relief Factor.[47]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz and Suzy Weiner on their wedding day in May 1973\n![](image)Spitz (far right) and his wife (far left) with President Gerald Ford and First Lady Betty Ford in 1976\nWhen Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father's business acquaintances.[38][48] Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973,[45] in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel.[42] They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin was a member of the Stanford swim team.[39][49] Spitz and his wife reside in Los Angeles, California.[50][51]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAt Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, Spitz was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. *Time* magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. \"I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there.\"[52] Spitz graduated from Indiana University in 1972.[53][54]\n\n\n\n### Post-swimming career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz's return to the United States following the 1972 Olympics, he landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.[55] \"A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today,\" Spitz said in 2007. \"I did very well, thank you very much.\"[56] Spitz added, \"I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts.\"[57] Spitz went on to start a real estate company.[58]\n\n\nPer his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker.[59] According to one interview, \"Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the 'water business', as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.\"[60]\n\n\nSpitz has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry. He travels the world, delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, *The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion* by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.[61]\n\n\nIn July 2012, he endorsed Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the award went to Tokyo.[62]\n\n\n\n### Hobbies[edit]\n\n\nHis hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.[63]\n\n\n\n### Famous moustache during Olympics[edit]\n\n\nIn an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated \"I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one.\"[52] Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. \"It took a long time to grow,\" he said.[64] It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a \"good-luck piece\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMark Spitz is quoted as saying, \"When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.'\nAccording to a *Sports Illustrated* article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. \"He looked great with it, don't get me wrong,\" explained his wife Suzy, \"but he looks so handsome without it.\"[65]\n\n\nWhen he was asked why he shaved it off he responded \"well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache ... I'm happy [without it].\"[66] He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz stating that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become \"too gray\",\n\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\nAfter retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.[67] \"During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming,\" says Spitz. \"It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening.\"\n\n\nHe has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.[68] \"People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact,\" said Spitz. \"I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down.\" He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.[69]\n\n\n\n## Olympic controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 1972 medal podium incident[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following his victory in the 200-meter freestyle, Spitz carried his shoes and arrived barefoot to obtain his gold medal. He put them down as the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played. After the anthem, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.[7]\n\n\n\n### Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSpitz has said that he felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven-gold-medal record: \"I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. ... I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is.\"[59] Spitz added, \"They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me,\" he said. \"Yes, I am a bit upset about it.\"[70] Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz, throwing first pitch at a baseball game (2008)\nHowever, on August 14, 2008, Spitz appeared on NBC's *Today Show* where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps:\n\n\n\n\n> It's about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I'm very happy for him. I really, truly am ... I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.[72]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, *Today in L.A.*, Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that \"Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever.\"[73]\n\n\nOn August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps's performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was \"epic\". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:\n\n\n\n\n> You know, Bob and Michael, I wondered what I was going to say at this monumental time, when it would happen and who I would say it to, and of course I thought I was going to say it to you for some time now. But, it's the word that comes to mind, \"epic\". What you did tonight was epic, and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are. I never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention, because I watched you at Athens win the race by similar margins, and 18 months ago at the World's by similar margins. And, you know, that is a tribute to your greatness. And now the whole world knows. We are so proud of you Michael here in America, and we are so proud of you and the way that you handle yourself, and you represent such an inspiration to all the youngsters around the world. You know, you weren't born when I did what I did, and I'm sure that I was a part of your inspiration, and I take that as a full compliment. And they say that you judge one's character by the company you keep, and I'm happy to keep company with you. And you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years, and I know that you will wear the crown well. Congratulations, Mike.[74]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2015, Spitz allegedly claimed that he had seen an email from Omega, the official timekeeper, that Phelps had lost the closely contested 100m butterfly final in 2008.[75] He later claimed that his quote had been \"misconstrued\".[76]\n\n\n\n### Views on drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMark Spitz has been consistent in his criticism of the two swimming world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its \"embarrassing\" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.[77]\n\n\nDuring a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying \"They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing.\"[78]\n\n\nIn August 2008, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying \"the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Olympics portal\n\n\n* List of Indiana University (Bloomington) people\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n* List of select Jewish swimmers\n* List of top Olympic gold medalists in swimming\n* World record progression 100 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 100 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 200 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 200 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 400 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 4 × 100 metres medley relay\n* World record progression 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame\".

He was the most successful competitor at these Games.[12] This also made him only the third Winter Olympian to win four golds at one Games, and he was also the first biathlete to win more than two gold medals at a single Games. In addition, he had won all three competitions staged at the Olympic test event in Salt Lake City the previous year.[7] He also took a four gold medal haul at the Biathlon World Championships 2005 in Hochfilzen, Austria and at the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.[1] Bjørndalen's 95 biathlon World Cup victories and one cross-country victory is two behind of Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann's record of 98 World Cup victories for a winter sport athlete.[1]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Bjørndalen took three medals from five events, winning two silvers and a bronze.[7] At the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, Bjørndalen became the most successful biathlete in Winter Olympic history by surpassing the previous record of nine career Olympic medals, which he shared with Uschi Disl of Germany. He then anchored Norway to gold in the 4 × 7.5 km relay. This was the second time that Norway had won a title in this event, with the other being at the 2002 Winter Olympics (also anchored by Bjørndalen). With this victory he became the second most decorated Winter Olympian of all time and one of only two athletes to win 11 medals at the Winter Olympics. With his gold medal in 10 km sprint at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, he tied fellow Norwegian Bjørn Dæhlie for most Winter Olympic medals, with 12 in total,[13] before overtaking Dæhlie by winning his second gold of the Games as part of the Norwegian mixed relay team.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bjørndalen in Kontiolahti, Finland, 12 February 2012, where he won the pursuit\nBjørndalen has won eight Olympic gold medals, four silver and a bronze.[14] He has also won 20 World Championship gold medals, 14 silver and 11 bronze (more than anybody in biathlon history), along with a record 95 World Cup victories in biathlon and 1 World Cup victory in cross-country skiing, 179 podium finishes in biathlon individual races and 3 in cross-country skiing.

Bjørndalen lay in third place in the standings going into the last three races of the season in Holmenkollen, with Poirée in first, and Fischer in second. However, Bjørndalen won all three races, giving him six victories in the last eight races, and clinching the crystal globe. He also won the pursuit, and the mass start title, and came second in the individual and the sprint. In the pursuit he finished ahead of Fischer by 54 points, and 29 points ahead of Poirée in the mass start. In the individual he finished 41 points behind Michael Greis, and in the sprint he was 5 points behind Tomasz Sikora. Norway finished fourth in the relay.\n\n\nBjørndalen closed out the season by winning all three events (sprint, pursuit, and mass start) at the Holmenkollen ski festival biathlon competition.

In the fifth race of the season, the pursuit race in Hochfilzen, he won with one of his largest margins ever, more than 2 minutes. On 30 December 2006 Bjørndalen took part in the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen in the Veltins Arena. In front of about 51,000 people he won it for fourth time in a row. His partner for second consecutive time was Linda Grubben. They both left their rivals, the Robert family, more than one minute behind.[21]\n\n\nIn Oberhof, coming down from training in the heights, Bjørndalen performed below standard for the season, and finishing only 30th and 5th in the individual competitions.\nIn Ruhpolding he led his teammates to victory in the relay event. He won the two following individual competitions. After competing in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Sapporo 2007, he missed several Biathlon World Cup events; after missing eight competitions altogether Bjørndalen finished second in the overall standings, after German Michael Greis.\n\n\n\n### 2008–09 World Cup season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008–09 World Cup season results  \n |\n| --- |\n| No. | World Cup location |  | Individual | Sprint | Pursuit | Mass start | Relay | Mixed relay |\n| 1 | Östersund, Sweden | 24 | 4 | 2 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | 12 | 2 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 3 | Hochfilzen, Austria | 14 | DNS | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 4 | Oberhof, Germany | — | 23 | — | 3 | 3 | —\n |\n| 5 | Ruhpolding, Germany | — | 1 | 1 | — | 1 | —\n |\n| 6 | Antholz-Anterselva, Italy | — | DNS | DNS | 5 | — | —\n |\n| WCH | Pyeongchang, South Korea | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 7 | Vancouver, Canada | 18 | 2 | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 8 | Trondheim, Norway | — | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | —\n |\n| 9 | Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia | — | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | —\n |\n| *Key:\"—\" denotes discipline not held; DNS—Did not start; WCH—World Championships*[1] |\n\n\nBjørndalen started off the season suffering from the effects of long-term illness, but still placed second in both of the pursuit events. He missed the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen, focusing on training instead. After the break, he returned with victories in both the sprint and pursuit events in Ruhpolding and a third place in the mass start in Oberhof.\n\n\nAt the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, during the men's 12.5 km pursuit, Bjørndalen with at least 15 other competitors accidentally skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap due to the bad marking. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of skiing beside it, which was the right way. A jury meeting decided to give all these athletes a one-minute time penalty, following a complaint from the Russian team. However, another complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result.[22] Along with Bjørndalen's first ever 20 km individual World Championship title, he won four out of six possible gold medals (10 km sprint, 12.5 km pursuit, 20 km individual and the 4 × 7.5 km relay).\n\n\nAfter the World Championships Bjørndalen came second in the sprint in Vancouver, he took over the world cup overall lead. He followed up with a second place, and two victories at the events in Granåsen, Trondheim (the latter being a mass start where he shot clean). He secured his sixth overall win in the last sprint of the season, in Khanty-Mansiysk where he placed second. In the following event (a pursuit), he was beaten at the finish line by teammate Emil Hegle Svendsen, but won the pursuit cup.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen grew up on a farm in Simostranda, the fourth of five children: one of his siblings is fellow biathlete Dag Bjørndalen. Both brothers were part of the Norwegian team that took the silver medal in the men's relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics.[7]\n\n\nBjørndalen resides in the village of Obertilliach, Austria. He also used to live in Toblach, Italy, with Italian-Belgian biathlete Nathalie Santer. They started dating in 1998 and married on 27 May 2006. On 4 October 2012, they filed for divorce by mutual consent.\n\n\nIn April 2016, along with announcing that he will continue his career until the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Bjørndalen confirmed that he was in a relationship with Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva, and that she was pregnant with the couple's first child.[23] On 7 July 2016, they married in Sjusjøen, Norway.[24] Their daughter Xenia was born on 1 October 2016.[25]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2018 Bjørndalen announced his retirement from biathlon. Bjørndalen ended his Olympic career after being left off Norway's 2018 team for PyeongChang, thus ending a bid for a seventh Winter Games.\n\n\n\n## Endorsement[edit]\n\n\nHis close to one hundred individual World Cup wins makes Ole Bjorndalen the most winning winter sports athlete of all time.

Shooting[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen is a solid shooter, but is generally outside the top twenty marksmen. Bjørndalen finished the 2005–06 season with a shooting percentage of 84%, hitting 292 out of 345 possible targets, that placed him in 36th position for shooting accuracy. His shooting record for both prone and standing were practically identical, 146/172 in the prone and 146/173 in the standing position. In the individual disciplines, he shot 92% in the individual, 89% in the sprint, 96% in the pursuit, 93% in the mass start and 96% in the relay.\n\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Bjørndalen was the 16th best shot with an 85% success rate, the second best Norwegian behind Egil Gjelland. He hit 331 targets out of a possible 364. His prone like most biathletes was much better than his standing shoot, he hit 169/180 (92%) in the prone and 163/184 (81%) in the standing. He had an average of 88% in the individual, sprint and relay, a 91% hit rate in the mass start but only 79% in the pursuit.

The theory is that it forces the knee more forward for better position and it incorporates the large gluteal muscles.[47]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of multiple Winter Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* All placings and results are sourced by the International Biathlon Union's searchable results database: \"IBU Datacenter\".

He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*née* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montréal.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.[122] His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4×100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and László Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", Čavić said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] Čavić later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic.

It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched László Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fiancée Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012–13 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and László Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 × 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4×100 free\n | 4×200 free\n | 4×100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.[293] *im* is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America[293] and through Special Olympics International.[294] The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.[297][298] Phelps stated he hoped to work with his Foundation more after retirement from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[299]\n\n\nIn 2017, Phelps joined the board of Medibio, a company focused on diagnosis of mental health disorders.[300]\n\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[*citation needed*] However, Johnny Weissmuller is reported to have broken 67 official world records.[301]\n\n\nAll but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. As of July 23, 2023[update], he holds world records in two events (indicated in **bold**), after his last standing individual world record in 400m IM was broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Distance\n | Event\n | Time\n | Location\n | Date\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly | 1:54.92\n | Austin, Texas, US\n | March 30, 2001 | [302] |\n| 2\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly (2)\n | 1:54.58\n | Fukuoka, Japan\n | July 24, 2001 | [302] |\n| 3\n | 400 m\n | Individual medley | 4:11.09\n | Ft.

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

He was called the \"Flying Finn\" or the \"Phantom Finn\", as he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.\n\n\nBorn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals,[3] although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.\n\n\nStruggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.\n\n\nNurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the \"even pace\" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi (second from right) with  \nhis family in 1924\nNurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine.[4] Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively.[5] In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932.[5] The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb.[4] They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day.[6] By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02.[4] Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later.[5] The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room.[4] Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery.[5] Although he stopped running actively,[4] he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku.[7] He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.[7]\n\n\nAt 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to \"have run Finland onto the map of the world\" at the 1912 Summer Olympics.[8] He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later.[6] Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters.[4] In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres.[9] Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics.[4] He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab. H. Ahlberg & Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919.[4] During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions.[4] After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.[4]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1920 Olympic trials\nIn the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand.[9] Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers,[9] despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial.[10] As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice.[4] Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs.[4] Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection.[9] In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (*alikersantti*).[4] On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and went on to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.[8][11]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\n### 1920–1924 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1924 Summer Olympics\nNurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.[9] He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics.[8] He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute,[12] the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku.[5] Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.[9]\n\n\nBuoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously.[13] Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance.[14] He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless.[13] Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921.[15] In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m.[14] A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile.[14] His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since.[8] Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record.[16] After excelling in mathematics,[17] Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.[5][9]\n\n\nNurmi's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day.[16] On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances.[18] In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster.[18] His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe,[18] still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds.[19] The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m.[18] Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace.[20][21] Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass.[20] The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel.[18] On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.[18]\n\n\nIn the cross country events, the heat of 45 °C (113 °F),[22] caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race.[18] Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers.[18] One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious.[23] Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital.[24][25] Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half.[18] As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward.[26] An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line.[26] After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold.[18][26] Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.[27]\n\n\nIn the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth.[18] Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him.[18][28] After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years.[28] He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.[29]\n\n\n\n### U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi, right, and Joie Ray, left, with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge during Nurmi's 1925 U.S. tour\nIn early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January.[30] His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris.[30] Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances.[30] Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances.[30] He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich.[30][31] Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards.[32] Although he hated losing more than anything,[33] Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich.[31] The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.[34] Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.[35]\n\n\nNurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems.[9] He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively.[9] As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland.[9] In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm,[29] despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide.[36] Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again.[37] In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer.[38] This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m.[32] In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna.[39] Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics.[40] At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances.[41] He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before,[41] the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.[42]\n\n\nAt the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight.[43] Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase.[43] He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot.[43] Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused.[43] In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead.[43] Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver.[43] Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day.[43] Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance.[43] On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record.[43] Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.[43]\n\n\n\n### Move to longer distances[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi checks his stopwatch in 1928\nNurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\"[8] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin.[15] Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945.[44] In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn.[45] He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile.[46][47] Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925,[46] and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him.[48] In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km.[15] In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles.[49][50] He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes.[49] Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\"[51]\n\n\nIn April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation.[52] The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing,[52] but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch,[53] and the Associated Press wrote that \"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\"[52] A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism.[53] Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.[54]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi running his first and only \"Short\" marathon 40.2 km (25.0 mi)at the 1932 Olympic trials in Viipuri\nOn 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25.0 mi) in 2:22:03.8 – on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00,[55] just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes.[56] Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon.[57] Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon.[55] The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon.[58] *The Guardian* reported that \"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\"[23] and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury.[8] Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.[59]\n\n\n\n### 1932 Olympics and later career[edit]\n\n\nLess than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles.[60] Sigfrid Edström, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4.[61] and 7/30/1932.[62] [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edström and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi's ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.][63][64]\nEdström stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case.[60] The AP called this \"one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history\", and wrote that the Games would now be \"like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.\"[65] Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki.[66] Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931.[65] The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be \"unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.\"[67] The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\"[68]\n\n\nOn the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted.[69] Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition.[69] However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially.[69] Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier,[70] Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes.[8] The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote.[71] However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm.[71] Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status,[72] and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden.[73] A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international.[74] After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.[72]\n\n\nNurmi refused to turn professional,[75] and continued running as an amateur in Finland.[8] In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926.[76][77] At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost.[78] The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code.[78] With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite.[78] Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934.[8] Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career.[79] In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.[80]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in his men's clothing store in Helsinki in 1939\nWhile active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods.[81] Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him.[81] Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him.[81] After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.[16] In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden.[82] However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games.[16][83] In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki.[84] It became a popular tourist attraction,[85] and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi.[86] The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction.[84] As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each.[87] Within five years, he was rated a millionaire.[85] His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price.[59] Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.[88]\n\n\nIn February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé Taisto Mäki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause.[8] The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and Mäki.[89] Hoover welcomed the two as \"ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.\"[90] While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar Höckert, had been killed in action.[91] Nurmi left for Finland in late April,[92] and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff.[93] Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (*ylikersantti*) and later to a sergeant first class (*vääpeli*).[93]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi lights the Olympic Flame in 1952\nIn 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.[88] His appearance astonished the spectators, and *Sports Illustrated* wrote that \"his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.\"[94] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower.[59] In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.[95]\n\n\nNurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman,[9] but his interest in running never died.[96] He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War.[97] Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club.[98] In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: \"The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'\"[99] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something.[100] Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala.[96] He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Paavo Nurmi in the early 1970s\nAlthough he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964,[101] Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews.[102] On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer.[103] Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art.[104] He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral.[28] Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: \"People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.\"[59] At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin,[9] Konsta Jylhä's *Vaiennut viulu* (*The Silenced Violin*) was played during the ceremony.[105] Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.[106]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in a calisthenic pose\nNurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907–1968) from 1932 to 1935.[84] Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, \"[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.\"[107] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a \"self-made\" businessman.[87] Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed \"uneasy\".[87] Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career.[87] As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father's time.[87] In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the \"three Olavis\" (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.[87] Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon \"Vampira\", was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi's niece.[108] However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.[108]\n\n\nNurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924.[109] He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21.[109] Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be \"taciturn\", \"stony-faced\" and \"stubborn\".[9] He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his \"sarcastic sense of humour\" among the small circles he knew.[9] Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak,[110] Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media,[9] stating later on his 75th birthday, \"[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.\"[87] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi \"is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.\"[111] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him *Suuri vaikenija* (The Great Silent One),[112] and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: \"Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer.[38][113] Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: \"Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.\"[38] Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: \"Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.\"[114] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that \"in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.\"[115] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: \"He grabbed ahold of me — he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!\"[116]\n\n\nNurmi's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", the \"King of Runners\" and \"Peerless Paavo\",[8][117][118] while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine.[119] One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi \"a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.\"[120] Phil Cousineau noted that \"his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.\"[120] Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a \"freakish heart\" with a very low pulse rate.[121] During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have \"the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.\"[118]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Wäinö Aaltonen and Paavo Nurmi with Aaltonen's bronze statue of Nurmi in the Ateneum museum in the late 1930s\nNurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km; a record in running.[15][122] He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58.[87] His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s.[15] Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008.[123] Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.[124] *Time* selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996,[125] and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.[126]\n\n\nNurmi introduced the \"even pace\" strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race.[127] He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\"[118] Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\"[128] Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running.[129][130] Peter Lovesey wrote in *The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners* that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\"[81] Cordner Nelson, founder of *Track & Field News*, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man’s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi's achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Zátopek chanted \"I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!\" when he trained as a child,[87] and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi's methods.[131] Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died.[115] Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could \"repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.\"[132] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games.[132] Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem *Olympic Laurel* that included a verse on Nurmi.[133] In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse *Nurmi* won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.[133]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi on the ten-mark bill\nA bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925.[134] The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.[134] In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship *Vasa* when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961.[135] Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work *Löpare* (*Runners*) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide.[133] *Boken om Nurmi* (*The Book about Nurmi*), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman.[133] Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939,[136] while Finnair named its first DC-8 *Paavo Nurmi* in 1969.[137] Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.[133]\n\n\nPaavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest.[138] In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957.[139] Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi.[140] A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987.[141] The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively.[141] The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993.[141] In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the *Paavo Nurmi Stadium*.[133] Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m.[142] In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel *Marathon Man* as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi.[143] The opera on Nurmi, *Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.*, written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000.[144] In a 2005 episode of *The Simpsons*, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.[145] The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.[146][147]\n\n\n\n## Career summary (1920–34)[edit]\n\n\n### Seasons[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi beats Wide to a win in Stockholm, July 1926.\n![refer to

He was the most successful competitor at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. This achievement set a record that lasted for 36 years, until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial.[1][2] *Swimming World Magazine* named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was born on February 10, 1950, in Modesto, California, the first of three children[3] of Lenore Sylvia (Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed \"Sklotkovick\", were from Russia.[4][5][6] When Spitz was two years old, his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. \"You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide,\" Lenore Spitz told a reporter for *Time* in 1968.[3] At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored six other Olympic medal winners.\n\n\nAt only 10, Spitz held one world age-group record and 17 national records.[7] When Spitz was 14, his family moved to Santa Clara, where he joined the Santa Clara Swim Club and was trained by coach George F. Haines.[7] From 1964 to 1968, Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance.[*citation needed*] In 1966 at age 16, he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 total AAU titles. The following year, Spitz emerged on the world swimming stage when he set his first world record at a small California meet with a time of 4:10.60 in the 400-meter freestyle.[8]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Maccabiah Games[edit]\n\n\nSpitz swam in his first international competition at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At age 15 and weighing 130 pounds, he won four gold medals in Tel Aviv—the 400 m freestyle, the 1,500 freestyle, the 400 m individual medley, and the 800 m freestyle relay, and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games.[3][9][10]\n\n\nHe returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete, at the 1969 Maccabiah Games. This time, he won six gold medals.[*citation needed*] He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.[11]\n\n\nIn 1985, Spitz lit the torch to open the 1985 Maccabiah Games.[12]\n\n\nIn 2005, he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 2005 Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games, with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.\n\n\n\n### Pan American Games[edit]\n\n\nHe won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira, won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### 1968 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1968 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz c. 1968\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1968 Mexico City |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:31.7\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:52.3\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 56.40\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 53.00\n |\n\n\nSpitz was already the holder of ten world records, and he brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33.[13] In addition, Spitz finished second to fellow American Doug Russell in the 100-meter butterfly. He lost to Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.[14] Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance.\n\n\n\n### College training[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance. in January 1969, he decided to attend Indiana University[2] to train with legendary Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman,[15] who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman \"the biggest decision of my life (and) the best.\"[16] While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972.\n\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Mark the Shark\" by his teammates.\n\n\n\n### 1972 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics and 1972 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz at the 1972 Olympics\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1972 Munich |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 2:00.70 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:26.42 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:52.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 54.27 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:35.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 51.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley relay  | 3:48.16 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz was back to repeat his quest for the six gold medals. He did even better, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Furthermore, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Spitz was originally reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing that he would not win the gold medal. Minutes before the race, he confessed on the pool deck to ABC's Donna de Varona, \"I know I say I don't want to swim before every event, but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure.\" Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacket worn by Mark Spitz during the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nSpitz is one of five Olympians to win nine or more career gold medals: Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis also have nine;[18] only Phelps has won more with 23. Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Phelps broke the record at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nAfter he had completed his events, Spitz left Munich early as a result of the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and later murdered by Palestinian terrorists.[19][20] Being Jewish himself, there was concern among the Olympic authorities that Spitz would become a likely target for the Palestinians and he was escorted to London for his own safety.[21][22][23] It is believed that he was escorted out of the country by US Marines stationed in West Germany.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was only 22 years old.[24]\n\n\nAt age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after filmmaker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying.[25] Spitz's comeback attempt made the cover of *Parade* and was also reported on in *Sports Illustrated* and *Esquire*.[26] Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz was two seconds slower than the Olympic standard and failed to qualify.[25]\n\n\nIn 1999, Spitz ranked No. 33 on *ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes*, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.[27]\n\n\n\n## Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\n* International Swimming Hall of Fame, Inducted 1977.[28]\n* International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 1979.[29]\n* United States Olympic Hall of Fame, Inducted 1983.[30]\n* Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Inducted 1990.[31]\n* San Jose Sports Hall of Fame, inducted Wednesday, November 14, 2007.[32][33]\n* National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007.[34]\n* Long Beach City College Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007[35]\n* Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame[36]\n\n\n## Film and television career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz retired from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while he was still a household name due to his athletic success.[37]\n\n\nA poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable.[38]\n\n\nIn Spitz's TV debut, he appeared as himself in a skit as a dentist on a Bob Hope special that aired October 5, 1972. In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* and *The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour*. On the TV drama *Emergency!*, he portrayed Pete Barlow, whose wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy) is accidentally shot by a handgun in an overfull drawer. He also appeared briefly on *The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast* of California Governor Ronald Reagan in September 1973.\n\n\nSpitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[39] In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in *Challenge of a Lifetime*. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure[38] except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.[38]\n\n\n\n### Narration[edit]\n\n\nSpitz narrated *Freedom's Fury*, a 2006 Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's Blood in the Water match against the Soviet Union during the Revolution of 1956—considered among the most famous water polo matches.[40] The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu,[41] and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.[40]\n\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\nHe appeared in an advertisement for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption \"I always drink it--is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers.\"\n\n\nIn 1974, he was in a number of Schick razors commercials.[42] In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation.\n\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS.[43] Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard's first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996 and 2004). The ad was entitled \"Shock\".[44] Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the \"Orbitrek Elite\" fitness workout.[45]\n\n\nIn 2012, Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2019 commercial, Spitz pitched a personal EKG device by KardiaMobile.[46]\n\n\nIn 2022, Spitz endorsed the health supplement Relief Factor.[47]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz and Suzy Weiner on their wedding day in May 1973\n![](image)Spitz (far right) and his wife (far left) with President Gerald Ford and First Lady Betty Ford in 1976\nWhen Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father's business acquaintances.[38][48] Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973,[45] in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel.[42] They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin was a member of the Stanford swim team.[39][49] Spitz and his wife reside in Los Angeles, California.[50][51]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAt Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, Spitz was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. *Time* magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. \"I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there.\"[52] Spitz graduated from Indiana University in 1972.[53][54]\n\n\n\n### Post-swimming career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz's return to the United States following the 1972 Olympics, he landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.[55] \"A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today,\" Spitz said in 2007. \"I did very well, thank you very much.\"[56] Spitz added, \"I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts.\"[57] Spitz went on to start a real estate company.[58]\n\n\nPer his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker.[59] According to one interview, \"Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the 'water business', as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.\"[60]\n\n\nSpitz has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry. He travels the world, delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, *The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion* by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.[61]\n\n\nIn July 2012, he endorsed Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the award went to Tokyo.[62]\n\n\n\n### Hobbies[edit]\n\n\nHis hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.[63]\n\n\n\n### Famous moustache during Olympics[edit]\n\n\nIn an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated \"I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one.\"[52] Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. \"It took a long time to grow,\" he said.[64] It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a \"good-luck piece\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMark Spitz is quoted as saying, \"When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.'\nAccording to a *Sports Illustrated* article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. \"He looked great with it, don't get me wrong,\" explained his wife Suzy, \"but he looks so handsome without it.\"[65]\n\n\nWhen he was asked why he shaved it off he responded \"well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache ... I'm happy [without it].\"[66] He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz stating that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become \"too gray\",\n\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\nAfter retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.[67] \"During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming,\" says Spitz. \"It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening.\"\n\n\nHe has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.[68] \"People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact,\" said Spitz. \"I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down.\" He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.[69]\n\n\n\n## Olympic controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 1972 medal podium incident[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following his victory in the 200-meter freestyle, Spitz carried his shoes and arrived barefoot to obtain his gold medal. He put them down as the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played. After the anthem, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.[7]\n\n\n\n### Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSpitz has said that he felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven-gold-medal record: \"I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. ... I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is.\"[59] Spitz added, \"They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me,\" he said. \"Yes, I am a bit upset about it.\"[70] Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz, throwing first pitch at a baseball game (2008)\nHowever, on August 14, 2008, Spitz appeared on NBC's *Today Show* where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps:\n\n\n\n\n> It's about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I'm very happy for him. I really, truly am ... I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.[72]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, *Today in L.A.*, Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that \"Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever.\"[73]\n\n\nOn August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps's performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was \"epic\". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:\n\n\n\n\n> You know, Bob and Michael, I wondered what I was going to say at this monumental time, when it would happen and who I would say it to, and of course I thought I was going to say it to you for some time now. But, it's the word that comes to mind, \"epic\". What you did tonight was epic, and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are. I never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention, because I watched you at Athens win the race by similar margins, and 18 months ago at the World's by similar margins. And, you know, that is a tribute to your greatness. And now the whole world knows. We are so proud of you Michael here in America, and we are so proud of you and the way that you handle yourself, and you represent such an inspiration to all the youngsters around the world. You know, you weren't born when I did what I did, and I'm sure that I was a part of your inspiration, and I take that as a full compliment. And they say that you judge one's character by the company you keep, and I'm happy to keep company with you. And you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years, and I know that you will wear the crown well. Congratulations, Mike.[74]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2015, Spitz allegedly claimed that he had seen an email from Omega, the official timekeeper, that Phelps had lost the closely contested 100m butterfly final in 2008.[75] He later claimed that his quote had been \"misconstrued\".[76]\n\n\n\n### Views on drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMark Spitz has been consistent in his criticism of the two swimming world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its \"embarrassing\" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.[77]\n\n\nDuring a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying \"They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing.\"[78]\n\n\nIn August 2008, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying \"the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Olympics portal\n\n\n* List of Indiana University (Bloomington) people\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n* List of select Jewish swimmers\n* List of top Olympic gold medalists in swimming\n* World record progression 100 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 100 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 200 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 200 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 400 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 4 × 100 metres medley relay\n* World record progression 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame\".

Bjørndalen lay in third place in the standings going into the last three races of the season in Holmenkollen, with Poirée in first, and Fischer in second. However, Bjørndalen won all three races, giving him six victories in the last eight races, and clinching the crystal globe. He also won the pursuit, and the mass start title, and came second in the individual and the sprint. In the pursuit he finished ahead of Fischer by 54 points, and 29 points ahead of Poirée in the mass start. In the individual he finished 41 points behind Michael Greis, and in the sprint he was 5 points behind Tomasz Sikora. Norway finished fourth in the relay.\n\n\nBjørndalen closed out the season by winning all three events (sprint, pursuit, and mass start) at the Holmenkollen ski festival biathlon competition. This put his career victories at the ski events to five, having won once both in 2003 (pursuit) and in 2004 (sprint).\n\n\n\n### 2006–07 World Cup season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006–07 World Cup season results  \n |\n| --- |\n| No. | World Cup location |  | Individual | Sprint | Pursuit | Mass start | Relay | Mixed relay |\n| 1 | Östersund, Sweden | 1 | 1 | 1 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | 1 | 1 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 3 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | DNS\\* | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 4 | Oberhof, Germany | — | 30 | 5 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 5 | Ruhpolding, Germany | — | 1 | — | 1 | 1 | —\n |\n| 6 | Pokljuka, Slovenia | — | DNS | DNS | DNS | — | —\n |\n| WCH | Antholz-Anterselva, Italy | 32 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 2 | DNS\n |\n| 7 | Lahti, Finland | DNS | DNS | DNS | — | — | —\n |\n| 8 | Oslo, Norway | 4 | — | 1 | 1 | — | —\n |\n| 9 | Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia | — | 48 | 9 | 4 | — | —\n |\n| \\*Two sprints were held in Hochfilzen, Bjoerndalen did not enter either.  *Key:\"—\" denotes discipline not held; DNS—Did not start; WCH—World Championships*[1] |\n\n\nBjørndalen made a perfect start to the season, winning all of the first five races in Östersund and Hochfilzen. In the fifth race of the season, the pursuit race in Hochfilzen, he won with one of his largest margins ever, more than 2 minutes. On 30 December 2006 Bjørndalen took part in the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen in the Veltins Arena. In front of about 51,000 people he won it for fourth time in a row. His partner for second consecutive time was Linda Grubben. They both left their rivals, the Robert family, more than one minute behind.[21]\n\n\nIn Oberhof, coming down from training in the heights, Bjørndalen performed below standard for the season, and finishing only 30th and 5th in the individual competitions.\nIn Ruhpolding he led his teammates to victory in the relay event. He won the two following individual competitions. After competing in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Sapporo 2007, he missed several Biathlon World Cup events; after missing eight competitions altogether Bjørndalen finished second in the overall standings, after German Michael Greis.\n\n\n\n### 2008–09 World Cup season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008–09 World Cup season results  \n |\n| --- |\n| No. | World Cup location |  | Individual | Sprint | Pursuit | Mass start | Relay | Mixed relay |\n| 1 | Östersund, Sweden | 24 | 4 | 2 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | 12 | 2 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 3 | Hochfilzen, Austria | 14 | DNS | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 4 | Oberhof, Germany | — | 23 | — | 3 | 3 | —\n |\n| 5 | Ruhpolding, Germany | — | 1 | 1 | — | 1 | —\n |\n| 6 | Antholz-Anterselva, Italy | — | DNS | DNS | 5 | — | —\n |\n| WCH | Pyeongchang, South Korea | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 7 | Vancouver, Canada | 18 | 2 | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 8 | Trondheim, Norway | — | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | —\n |\n| 9 | Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia | — | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | —\n |\n| *Key:\"—\" denotes discipline not held; DNS—Did not start; WCH—World Championships*[1] |\n\n\nBjørndalen started off the season suffering from the effects of long-term illness, but still placed second in both of the pursuit events. He missed the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen, focusing on training instead. After the break, he returned with victories in both the sprint and pursuit events in Ruhpolding and a third place in the mass start in Oberhof.\n\n\nAt the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, during the men's 12.5 km pursuit, Bjørndalen with at least 15 other competitors accidentally skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap due to the bad marking. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of skiing beside it, which was the right way. A jury meeting decided to give all these athletes a one-minute time penalty, following a complaint from the Russian team. However, another complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result.[22] Along with Bjørndalen's first ever 20 km individual World Championship title, he won four out of six possible gold medals (10 km sprint, 12.5 km pursuit, 20 km individual and the 4 × 7.5 km relay).\n\n\nAfter the World Championships Bjørndalen came second in the sprint in Vancouver, he took over the world cup overall lead. He followed up with a second place, and two victories at the events in Granåsen, Trondheim (the latter being a mass start where he shot clean). He secured his sixth overall win in the last sprint of the season, in Khanty-Mansiysk where he placed second. In the following event (a pursuit), he was beaten at the finish line by teammate Emil Hegle Svendsen, but won the pursuit cup.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen grew up on a farm in Simostranda, the fourth of five children: one of his siblings is fellow biathlete Dag Bjørndalen. Both brothers were part of the Norwegian team that took the silver medal in the men's relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics.[7]\n\n\nBjørndalen resides in the village of Obertilliach, Austria. He also used to live in Toblach, Italy, with Italian-Belgian biathlete Nathalie Santer. They started dating in 1998 and married on 27 May 2006. On 4 October 2012, they filed for divorce by mutual consent.\n\n\nIn April 2016, along with announcing that he will continue his career until the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Bjørndalen confirmed that he was in a relationship with Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva, and that she was pregnant with the couple's first child.[23] On 7 July 2016, they married in Sjusjøen, Norway.[24] Their daughter Xenia was born on 1 October 2016.[25]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2018 Bjørndalen announced his retirement from biathlon. Bjørndalen ended his Olympic career after being left off Norway's 2018 team for PyeongChang, thus ending a bid for a seventh Winter Games.\n\n\n\n## Endorsement[edit]\n\n\nHis close to one hundred individual World Cup wins makes Ole Bjorndalen the most winning winter sports athlete of all time. He brings the same focused intensity and spirit of victory to the brands and products who sponsor him. Ole Bjorndalen cooperates with big and renowned brands. He has been Certina's loyal ambassador since 2011,[26] InstaForex brand ambassador since 2015.[27] Among sports equipment brands that he promotes are Madshus,[28] Odlo,[29] and Casco.[30]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nOle Einar Bjørndalen won the Aftenposten Gold Medal in 1998.

Shooting[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen is a solid shooter, but is generally outside the top twenty marksmen. Bjørndalen finished the 2005–06 season with a shooting percentage of 84%, hitting 292 out of 345 possible targets, that placed him in 36th position for shooting accuracy. His shooting record for both prone and standing were practically identical, 146/172 in the prone and 146/173 in the standing position. In the individual disciplines, he shot 92% in the individual, 89% in the sprint, 96% in the pursuit, 93% in the mass start and 96% in the relay.\n\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Bjørndalen was the 16th best shot with an 85% success rate, the second best Norwegian behind Egil Gjelland. He hit 331 targets out of a possible 364. His prone like most biathletes was much better than his standing shoot, he hit 169/180 (92%) in the prone and 163/184 (81%) in the standing. He had an average of 88% in the individual, sprint and relay, a 91% hit rate in the mass start but only 79% in the pursuit. During his career in 1999–00 he averaged 82%, in 2000–01 78%, 2001–02 74%, 2002–03 86% and in 2003–04 he hit 80% of the targets, however in those five years his standing shoot was the same or better than his prone shoot. In comparison, his greatest rival Raphaël Poirée averaged 87% in 2004–05 and 86% in 2005–06. Nikolay Kruglov was the best shot in 2004–05 with a 91% success rate, with Ricco Groß in second with 89%, and in 2005 Julien Robert was best with a 93% average and Groß again second with 91%.[1]\n\n\n\n### Shooting statistics[edit]\n\n\nStatistics sourced from the International Biathlon Union.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Shooting\n | 2004–05\n | 2005–06\n | 2006–07\n | 2007–08\n | 2008–09\n | 2009–10\n | 2010–11\n | 2011–12\n | 2012–13\n | 2013–14\n | 2014–15\n | 2015–16\n | 2016–17\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall | 85% | 84% | 84% | 83% | 85% | 83% | 86% | 80%\n |  |  | 85%\n | 84%\n | 85%\n |\n| Prone position | 89% | 84% | 85% | 84% | 85% | 87% | 89% | 85%\n |  |  | 88%\n | 84%\n | 86%\n |\n| Standing position | 81% | 84% | 84% | 82% | 86% | 80% | 83% | 75%\n |  |  | 82%\n | 84%\n | 84%\n |\n\n\nand[45]\n\n\n\n## Cross-country skiing results[edit]\n\n\nAll results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).[2]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Year \n |  Age \n |  15 km \n |  Pursuit \n |  30 km \n |  50 km \n |  Sprint \n |  4 × 10 km  relay \n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | *28* | — | — | 5 | — | — | — |\n\n\n### World Championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Year \n |  Age \n |  15 km  individual \n |  30 km  skiathlon \n |  50 km  mass start \n |  Sprint \n |  4 × 10 km  relay \n |  Team  sprint \n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005 | *31* | 11 | — | — | — | — | — |\n| 2007 | *33* | 13 | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n\n### World Cup[edit]\n\n\n#### Season standings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Season \n |  Age \n | Discipline standings\n | Ski Tour standings\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall\n | Distance\n | Long Distance\n | Sprint\n | NordicOpening\n | Tour deSki\n | World CupFinal\n |\n| 1999 | *25* | 63 | — | 48 | 89 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2002 | *28* | 29 | — | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2003 | *29* | 100 | — | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2004 | *30* | 108 | 69 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2005 | *31* | 64 | 39 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2007 | *33* | 46 | 25 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2008 | *34* | 81 | 49 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2011 | *37* | 153 | 97 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n#### Individual podiums[edit]\n\n\n* 1 victory – (1 WC)\n* 3 podiums – (3 WC)\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Season\n | Date\n | Location\n | Race\n | Level\n | Place\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **2001–02** | 25 November 2001 | ![Finland](image) Kuopio, Finland | 10 km Individual F | World Cup | 2nd\n |\n| 2 | 22 December 2001 | ![Austria](image) Ramsau, Austria | 30 km Mass Start F | World Cup | 2nd\n |\n| 3 | **2006–07** | 18 November 2006 | ![Sweden](image) Gällivare, Sweden | 15 km Individual F | World Cup | **1st** |\n\n\n#### Team podiums[edit]\n\n\n* 3 podiums – (3 RL)\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Season\n | Date\n | Location\n | Race\n | Level\n | Place\n | Teammates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **1998–99** | 29 November 1998 | ![Finland](image) Muonio, Finland | 4 × 10 km Relay F | World Cup | 2nd | Skjeldal / Dæhlie / Hetland |\n| 2 | **2003–04** | 23 November 2003 | ![Norway](image) Beitostølen, Norway | 4 × 10 km Relay C/F | World Cup | 3rd | Estil / Bjonviken / Andresen |\n| 3 | **2006–07** | 17 December 2006 | ![France](image) La Clusaz, France | 4 × 10 km Relay C/F | World Cup | 2nd | Hetland / Rønning / Northug |\n\n\n## Equipment[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen uses Madshus skis, boots and poles.\nHe uses Rottefella NNN bindings.\nHis gloves and base layer are from Odlo, and he uses Casco glasses.[46]\n\n\nDuring the off-season in 2006 Bjørndalen was testing a new ski boot that had a high heel in the Torsby ski tunnel with boot manufacturers Madshus. The theory is that it forces the knee more forward for better position and it incorporates the large gluteal muscles.[47]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of multiple Winter Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* All placings and results are sourced by the International Biathlon Union's searchable results database: \"IBU Datacenter\".

Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. (If they were, Ray Ewry would be second on the list with 10 gold). It includes top-three placings in 1896 and 1900, before medals were awarded for top-three placings. The Olympics listed for each athlete **only include games in which they won medals**. See the particular article on the athlete for more details on when and for what nation an athlete competed. More medals are available in some events than others, and the number of events in which medals are available overall has changed over time. \n\n\n\nNames in **bold** denote people that have competed in the most recent Olympics, namely 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.\n\n\n| No.\n | Athlete\n | Nation\n | Sport\n | Years\n | Games\n | Gender\n | Gold\n | Silver\n |

record for most titles won. It includes titles won in 1896 and 1900, before gold medals were awarded for first place. All record-holders have competed at Summer Games rather than Winter Games.\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps, holder of the record for the most Olympic gold medals, with one of his medals at the 2008

He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*née* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montréal.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.[122] His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4×100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and László Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", Čavić said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] Čavić later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic.

It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched László Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fiancée Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012–13 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and László Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 × 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4×100 free\n | 4×200 free\n | 4×100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.[293] *im* is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America[293] and through Special Olympics International.[294] The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.[297][298] Phelps stated he hoped to work with his Foundation more after retirement from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[299]\n\n\nIn 2017, Phelps joined the board of Medibio, a company focused on diagnosis of mental health disorders.[300]\n\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[*citation needed*] However, Johnny Weissmuller is reported to have broken 67 official world records.[301]\n\n\nAll but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. As of July 23, 2023[update], he holds world records in two events (indicated in **bold**), after his last standing individual world record in 400m IM was broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Distance\n | Event\n | Time\n | Location\n | Date\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly | 1:54.92\n | Austin, Texas, US\n | March 30, 2001 | [302] |\n| 2\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly (2)\n | 1:54.58\n | Fukuoka, Japan\n | July 24, 2001 | [302] |\n| 3\n | 400 m\n | Individual medley | 4:11.09\n | Ft.

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

He was called the \"Flying Finn\" or the \"Phantom Finn\", as he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.\n\n\nBorn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals,[3] although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.\n\n\nStruggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.\n\n\nNurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the \"even pace\" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi (second from right) with  \nhis family in 1924\nNurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine.[4] Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively.[5] In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932.[5] The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb.[4] They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day.[6] By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02.[4] Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later.[5] The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room.[4] Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery.[5] Although he stopped running actively,[4] he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku.[7] He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.[7]\n\n\nAt 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to \"have run Finland onto the map of the world\" at the 1912 Summer Olympics.[8] He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later.[6] Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters.[4] In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres.[9] Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics.[4] He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab.

Ahlberg & Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919.[4] During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions.[4] After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.[4]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1920 Olympic trials\nIn the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand.[9] Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers,[9] despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial.[10] As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice.[4] Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs.[4] Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection.[9] In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (*alikersantti*).[4] On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and went on to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.[8][11]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\n### 1920–1924 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1924 Summer Olympics\nNurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.[9] He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics.[8] He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute,[12] the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku.[5] Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.[9]\n\n\nBuoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously.[13] Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance.[14] He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless.[13] Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921.[15] In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m.[14] A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile.[14] His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since.[8] Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record.[16] After excelling in mathematics,[17] Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.[5][9]\n\n\nNurmi's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day.[16] On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances.[18] In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster.[18] His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe,[18] still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds.[19] The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m.[18] Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace.[20][21] Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass.[20] The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel.[18] On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.[18]\n\n\nIn the cross country events, the heat of 45 °C (113 °F),[22] caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race.[18] Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers.[18] One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious.[23] Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital.[24][25] Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half.[18] As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward.[26] An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line.[26] After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold.[18][26] Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.[27]\n\n\nIn the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth.[18] Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him.[18][28] After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years.[28] He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.[29]\n\n\n\n### U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi, right, and Joie Ray, left, with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge during Nurmi's 1925 U.S. tour\nIn early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January.[30] His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris.[30] Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances.[30] Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances.[30] He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich.[30][31] Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards.[32] Although he hated losing more than anything,[33] Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich.[31] The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.[34] Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.[35]\n\n\nNurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems.[9] He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively.[9] As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland.[9] In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm,[29] despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide.[36] Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again.[37] In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer.[38] This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m.[32] In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna.[39] Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics.[40] At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances.[41] He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before,[41] the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.[42]\n\n\nAt the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight.[43] Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase.[43] He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot.[43] Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused.[43] In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead.[43] Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver.[43] Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day.[43] Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance.[43] On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record.[43] Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.[43]\n\n\n\n### Move to longer distances[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi checks his stopwatch in 1928\nNurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\"[8] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin.[15] Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945.[44] In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn.[45] He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile.[46][47] Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925,[46] and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him.[48] In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km.[15] In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles.[49][50] He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes.[49] Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\"[51]\n\n\nIn April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation.[52] The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing,[52] but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch,[53] and the Associated Press wrote that \"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\"[52] A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism.[53] Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.[54]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi running his first and only \"Short\" marathon 40.2 km (25.0 mi)at the 1932 Olympic trials in Viipuri\nOn 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25.0 mi) in 2:22:03.8 – on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00,[55] just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes.[56] Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon.[57] Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon.[55] The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon.[58] *The Guardian* reported that \"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\"[23] and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury.[8] Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.[59]\n\n\n\n### 1932 Olympics and later career[edit]\n\n\nLess than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles.[60] Sigfrid Edström, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4.[61] and 7/30/1932.[62] [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edström and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi's ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.][63][64]\nEdström stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case.[60] The AP called this \"one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history\", and wrote that the Games would now be \"like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.\"[65] Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki.[66] Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931.[65] The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be \"unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.\"[67] The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\"[68]\n\n\nOn the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted.[69] Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition.[69] However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially.[69] Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier,[70] Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes.[8] The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote.[71] However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm.[71] Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status,[72] and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden.[73] A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international.[74] After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.[72]\n\n\nNurmi refused to turn professional,[75] and continued running as an amateur in Finland.[8] In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926.[76][77] At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost.[78] The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code.[78] With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite.[78] Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934.[8] Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career.[79] In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.[80]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in his men's clothing store in Helsinki in 1939\nWhile active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods.[81] Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him.[81] Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him.[81] After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.[16] In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden.[82] However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games.[16][83] In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki.[84] It became a popular tourist attraction,[85] and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi.[86] The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction.[84] As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each.[87] Within five years, he was rated a millionaire.[85] His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price.[59] Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.[88]\n\n\nIn February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé Taisto Mäki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause.[8] The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and Mäki.[89] Hoover welcomed the two as \"ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.\"[90] While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar Höckert, had been killed in action.[91] Nurmi left for Finland in late April,[92] and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff.[93] Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (*ylikersantti*) and later to a sergeant first class (*vääpeli*).[93]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi lights the Olympic Flame in 1952\nIn 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.[88] His appearance astonished the spectators, and *Sports Illustrated* wrote that \"his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.\"[94] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower.[59] In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.[95]\n\n\nNurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman,[9] but his interest in running never died.[96] He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War.[97] Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club.[98] In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: \"The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'\"[99] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something.[100] Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala.[96] He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Paavo Nurmi in the early 1970s\nAlthough he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964,[101] Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews.[102] On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer.[103] Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art.[104] He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral.[28] Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: \"People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.\"[59] At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin,[9] Konsta Jylhä's *Vaiennut viulu* (*The Silenced Violin*) was played during the ceremony.[105] Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.[106]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in a calisthenic pose\nNurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907–1968) from 1932 to 1935.[84] Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, \"[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.\"[107] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a \"self-made\" businessman.[87] Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed \"uneasy\".[87] Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career.[87] As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father's time.[87] In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the \"three Olavis\" (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.[87] Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon \"Vampira\", was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi's niece.[108] However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.[108]\n\n\nNurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924.[109] He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21.[109] Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be \"taciturn\", \"stony-faced\" and \"stubborn\".[9] He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his \"sarcastic sense of humour\" among the small circles he knew.[9] Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak,[110] Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media,[9] stating later on his 75th birthday, \"[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.\"[87] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi \"is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.\"[111] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him *Suuri vaikenija* (The Great Silent One),[112] and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: \"Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer.[38][113] Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: \"Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.\"[38] Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: \"Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.\"[114] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that \"in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.\"[115] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: \"He grabbed ahold of me — he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!\"[116]\n\n\nNurmi's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", the \"King of Runners\" and \"Peerless Paavo\",[8][117][118] while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine.[119] One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi \"a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.\"[120] Phil Cousineau noted that \"his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.\"[120] Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a \"freakish heart\" with a very low pulse rate.[121] During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have \"the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.\"[118]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Wäinö Aaltonen and Paavo Nurmi with Aaltonen's bronze statue of Nurmi in the Ateneum museum in the late 1930s\nNurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km; a record in running.[15][122] He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58.[87] His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s.[15] Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008.[123] Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.[124] *Time* selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996,[125] and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.[126]\n\n\nNurmi introduced the \"even pace\" strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race.[127] He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\"[118] Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\"[128] Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running.[129][130] Peter Lovesey wrote in *The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners* that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\"[81] Cordner Nelson, founder of *Track & Field News*, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man’s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi's achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Zátopek chanted \"I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!\" when he trained as a child,[87] and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi's methods.[131] Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died.[115] Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could \"repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.\"[132] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games.[132] Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem *Olympic Laurel* that included a verse on Nurmi.[133] In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse *Nurmi* won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.[133]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi on the ten-mark bill\nA bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925.[134] The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.[134] In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship *Vasa* when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961.[135] Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work *Löpare* (*Runners*) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide.[133] *Boken om Nurmi* (*The Book about Nurmi*), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman.[133] Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939,[136] while Finnair named its first DC-8 *Paavo Nurmi* in 1969.[137] Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.[133]\n\n\nPaavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest.[138] In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957.[139] Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi.[140] A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987.[141] The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively.[141] The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993.[141] In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the *Paavo Nurmi Stadium*.[133] Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m.[142] In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel *Marathon Man* as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi.[143] The opera on Nurmi, *Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.*, written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000.[144] In a 2005 episode of *The Simpsons*, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.[145] The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.[146][147]\n\n\n\n## Career summary (1920–34)[edit]\n\n\n### Seasons[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi beats Wide to a win in Stockholm, July 1926.\n![refer to

He was the most successful competitor at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. This achievement set a record that lasted for 36 years, until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial.[1][2] *Swimming World Magazine* named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was born on February 10, 1950, in Modesto, California, the first of three children[3] of Lenore Sylvia (Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed \"Sklotkovick\", were from Russia.[4][5][6] When Spitz was two years old, his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. \"You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide,\" Lenore Spitz told a reporter for *Time* in 1968.[3] At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored six other Olympic medal winners.\n\n\nAt only 10, Spitz held one world age-group record and 17 national records.[7] When Spitz was 14, his family moved to Santa Clara, where he joined the Santa Clara Swim Club and was trained by coach George F. Haines.[7] From 1964 to 1968, Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance.[*citation needed*] In 1966 at age 16, he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 total AAU titles. The following year, Spitz emerged on the world swimming stage when he set his first world record at a small California meet with a time of 4:10.60 in the 400-meter freestyle.[8]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Maccabiah Games[edit]\n\n\nSpitz swam in his first international competition at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At age 15 and weighing 130 pounds, he won four gold medals in Tel Aviv—the 400 m freestyle, the 1,500 freestyle, the 400 m individual medley, and the 800 m freestyle relay, and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games.[3][9][10]\n\n\nHe returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete, at the 1969 Maccabiah Games. This time, he won six gold medals.[*citation needed*] He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.[11]\n\n\nIn 1985, Spitz lit the torch to open the 1985 Maccabiah Games.[12]\n\n\nIn 2005, he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 2005 Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games, with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.\n\n\n\n### Pan American Games[edit]\n\n\nHe won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira, won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### 1968 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1968 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz c. 1968\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1968 Mexico City |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:31.7\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:52.3\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 56.40\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 53.00\n |\n\n\nSpitz was already the holder of ten world records, and he brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33.[13] In addition, Spitz finished second to fellow American Doug Russell in the 100-meter butterfly. He lost to Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.[14] Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance.\n\n\n\n### College training[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance. in January 1969, he decided to attend Indiana University[2] to train with legendary Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman,[15] who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman \"the biggest decision of my life (and) the best.\"[16] While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972.\n\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Mark the Shark\" by his teammates.\n\n\n\n### 1972 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics and 1972 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz at the 1972 Olympics\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1972 Munich |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 2:00.70 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:26.42 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:52.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 54.27 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:35.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 51.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley relay  | 3:48.16 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz was back to repeat his quest for the six gold medals. He did even better, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Furthermore, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Spitz was originally reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing that he would not win the gold medal. Minutes before the race, he confessed on the pool deck to ABC's Donna de Varona, \"I know I say I don't want to swim before every event, but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure.\" Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacket worn by Mark Spitz during the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nSpitz is one of five Olympians to win nine or more career gold medals: Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis also have nine;[18] only Phelps has won more with 23. Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Phelps broke the record at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nAfter he had completed his events, Spitz left Munich early as a result of the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and later murdered by Palestinian terrorists.[19][20] Being Jewish himself, there was concern among the Olympic authorities that Spitz would become a likely target for the Palestinians and he was escorted to London for his own safety.[21][22][23] It is believed that he was escorted out of the country by US Marines stationed in West Germany.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was only 22 years old.[24]\n\n\nAt age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after filmmaker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying.[25] Spitz's comeback attempt made the cover of *Parade* and was also reported on in *Sports Illustrated* and *Esquire*.[26] Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz was two seconds slower than the Olympic standard and failed to qualify.[25]\n\n\nIn 1999, Spitz ranked No. 33 on *ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes*, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.[27]\n\n\n\n## Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\n* International Swimming Hall of Fame, Inducted 1977.[28]\n* International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 1979.[29]\n* United States Olympic Hall of Fame, Inducted 1983.[30]\n* Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Inducted 1990.[31]\n* San Jose Sports Hall of Fame, inducted Wednesday, November 14, 2007.[32][33]\n* National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007.[34]\n* Long Beach City College Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007[35]\n* Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame[36]\n\n\n## Film and television career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz retired from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while he was still a household name due to his athletic success.[37]\n\n\nA poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable.[38]\n\n\nIn Spitz's TV debut, he appeared as himself in a skit as a dentist on a Bob Hope special that aired October 5, 1972. In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* and *The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour*. On the TV drama *Emergency!*, he portrayed Pete Barlow, whose wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy) is accidentally shot by a handgun in an overfull drawer. He also appeared briefly on *The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast* of California Governor Ronald Reagan in September 1973.\n\n\nSpitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[39] In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in *Challenge of a Lifetime*. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure[38] except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.[38]\n\n\n\n### Narration[edit]\n\n\nSpitz narrated *Freedom's Fury*, a 2006 Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's Blood in the Water match against the Soviet Union during the Revolution of 1956—considered among the most famous water polo matches.[40] The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu,[41] and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.[40]\n\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\nHe appeared in an advertisement for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption \"I always drink it--is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers.\"\n\n\nIn 1974, he was in a number of Schick razors commercials.[42] In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation.\n\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS.[43] Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard's first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996 and 2004). The ad was entitled \"Shock\".[44] Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the \"Orbitrek Elite\" fitness workout.[45]\n\n\nIn 2012, Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2019 commercial, Spitz pitched a personal EKG device by KardiaMobile.[46]\n\n\nIn 2022, Spitz endorsed the health supplement Relief Factor.[47]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz and Suzy Weiner on their wedding day in May 1973\n![](image)Spitz (far right) and his wife (far left) with President Gerald Ford and First Lady Betty Ford in 1976\nWhen Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father's business acquaintances.[38][48] Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973,[45] in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel.[42] They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin was a member of the Stanford swim team.[39][49] Spitz and his wife reside in Los Angeles, California.[50][51]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAt Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, Spitz was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. *Time* magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. \"I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there.\"[52] Spitz graduated from Indiana University in 1972.[53][54]\n\n\n\n### Post-swimming career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz's return to the United States following the 1972 Olympics, he landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.[55] \"A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today,\" Spitz said in 2007. \"I did very well, thank you very much.\"[56] Spitz added, \"I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts.\"[57] Spitz went on to start a real estate company.[58]\n\n\nPer his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker.[59] According to one interview, \"Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the 'water business', as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.\"[60]\n\n\nSpitz has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry. He travels the world, delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, *The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion* by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.[61]\n\n\nIn July 2012, he endorsed Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the award went to Tokyo.[62]\n\n\n\n### Hobbies[edit]\n\n\nHis hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.[63]\n\n\n\n### Famous moustache during Olympics[edit]\n\n\nIn an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated \"I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one.\"[52] Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. \"It took a long time to grow,\" he said.[64] It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a \"good-luck piece\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMark Spitz is quoted as saying, \"When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.'\nAccording to a *Sports Illustrated* article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. \"He looked great with it, don't get me wrong,\" explained his wife Suzy, \"but he looks so handsome without it.\"[65]\n\n\nWhen he was asked why he shaved it off he responded \"well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache ... I'm happy [without it].\"[66] He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz stating that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become \"too gray\",\n\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\nAfter retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.[67] \"During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming,\" says Spitz. \"It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening.\"\n\n\nHe has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.[68] \"People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact,\" said Spitz. \"I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down.\" He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.[69]\n\n\n\n## Olympic controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 1972 medal podium incident[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following his victory in the 200-meter freestyle, Spitz carried his shoes and arrived barefoot to obtain his gold medal. He put them down as the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played. After the anthem, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.[7]\n\n\n\n### Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSpitz has said that he felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven-gold-medal record: \"I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. ... I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is.\"[59] Spitz added, \"They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me,\" he said. \"Yes, I am a bit upset about it.\"[70] Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz, throwing first pitch at a baseball game (2008)\nHowever, on August 14, 2008, Spitz appeared on NBC's *Today Show* where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps:\n\n\n\n\n> It's about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I'm very happy for him. I really, truly am ... I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.[72]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, *Today in L.A.*, Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that \"Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever.\"[73]\n\n\nOn August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps's performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was \"epic\". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:\n\n\n\n\n> You know, Bob and Michael, I wondered what I was going to say at this monumental time, when it would happen and who I would say it to, and of course I thought I was going to say it to you for some time now. But, it's the word that comes to mind, \"epic\". What you did tonight was epic, and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are. I never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention, because I watched you at Athens win the race by similar margins, and 18 months ago at the World's by similar margins. And, you know, that is a tribute to your greatness. And now the whole world knows. We are so proud of you Michael here in America, and we are so proud of you and the way that you handle yourself, and you represent such an inspiration to all the youngsters around the world. You know, you weren't born when I did what I did, and I'm sure that I was a part of your inspiration, and I take that as a full compliment. And they say that you judge one's character by the company you keep, and I'm happy to keep company with you. And you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years, and I know that you will wear the crown well. Congratulations, Mike.[74]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2015, Spitz allegedly claimed that he had seen an email from Omega, the official timekeeper, that Phelps had lost the closely contested 100m butterfly final in 2008.[75] He later claimed that his quote had been \"misconstrued\".[76]\n\n\n\n### Views on drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMark Spitz has been consistent in his criticism of the two swimming world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its \"embarrassing\" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.[77]\n\n\nDuring a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying \"They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing.\"[78]\n\n\nIn August 2008, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying \"the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Olympics portal\n\n\n* List of Indiana University (Bloomington) people\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n* List of select Jewish swimmers\n* List of top Olympic gold medalists in swimming\n* World record progression 100 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 100 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 200 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 200 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 400 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 4 × 100 metres medley relay\n* World record progression 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame\".

His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only six Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.\n\n\nLewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set world records in the 100 m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relays, while his world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke 10 seconds for the 100 meters fifteen times and 20 seconds for the 200 meters ten times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet seventy-one times.\n\n\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the International Olympic Committee, \"Olympian of the Century\" by *Sports Illustrated* and \"Athlete of the Year\" by *Track & Field News* in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\n\nAfter retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a Democrat in the New Jersey Senate, but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.\n\n\n\n\n## Athletic career[edit]\n\n\n### Fame as a competitive athlete[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis performing the long jump as a University of Houston college athlete\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927–1987)[2] and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team.[3] His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues.[4] His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both him and his sister, Carol.[5] She became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[6]\n\n\nLewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status.[5] At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey.[3][7] He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.[3]\n\n\nMany colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis's coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in).[8] By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to *Track and Field News*.[9]\n\n\nAn old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35 m (27 ft 4+1⁄2 in).[3]\n\n\nThough his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team.[3] The Olympic boycott precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow; he instead participated in the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77 m (25 ft 5+3⁄4 in) for a bronze medal, and the American 4 × 100 m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61 s.[10] He received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the athletes precluded from competing in the 1980 Olympics.[11] At year's end, he was ranked sixth in the world in the long jump and seventh in the 100 m.[9][12]\n\n\n\n### Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982[edit]\n\n\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 m (28 ft 3+1⁄4 in) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.[13]\n\n\nWhile marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records,[14] Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level. In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, \"I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don't want that '(A)' [for altitude] after the mark.\"[15] When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men's 100 m and 200 m records and the long jump record had been set at the high altitude of Mexico City.[14]\n\n\nAlso in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100 m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67 s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00 s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.[16] For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100 m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100 m and long jump. Additionally, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.[17]\n\n\nIn 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge Bob Beamon's world record of 8.90 m (29 ft 2+1⁄4 in) in the long jump set at the 1968 Olympics, a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever.[18] Before Lewis, 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and 1980 Olympic champion Lutz Dombrowski. During 1982, Lewis cleared 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.76 m (28 ft 8+3⁄4 in) at Indianapolis on July 24.[19] He also ran 10.00 s in the 100 m, the world's fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00 s clocking the same weekend he leapt 8.61 m (28 ft 2+3⁄4 in) twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record 8.76 m (28 ft 8+3⁄4 in) at Indianapolis, he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon's record, the third which several observers said reached 30 ft 0 in (9.14 m). Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.[20]\n\n\nHe repeated his number one ranking in the 100 m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200 m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by *Track and Field News*. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100 m ranking six times (seven if Ben Johnson's 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third.[12] His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.[9]\n\n\n\n### 1983 and the inaugural World Championships[edit]\n\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first World Championships in 1983. Lewis' chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55 m (28 ft 1⁄2 in) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26 m (10 in).[21]\n\n\nHe also won the 100 m with relative ease. There, Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100 m at altitude with a 9.93 s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07 s to 10.21 s.[22] Smith won the 200 m title,[23] an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis' shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200 m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03 s behind Pietro Mennea's 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he did not ease off in the final meters to raise his arms in celebration.[24][25] Finally, Lewis ran the anchor in the 4 × 100 m relay, winning in 37.86 s, a new world record and the first in Lewis' career.[26]\n\n\nLewis' year-best performances in the 100 m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100 m at low-altitude with a 9.97 s in Modesto on May 14.[27][28] His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith's world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79 m (28 ft 10 in)[24] and earned the world number one ranking in that event.[29] *Track and Field News* ranked him number two in the 200 m, despite his low-altitude record of 19.75 s, behind Smith, who had won gold at Helsinki.[30] Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1984 Summer Olympics: emulating Jesse Owens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis sprinting at the 1984 Summer Olympics\nAt the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of them and thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin.[32]\n\n\nLewis started his quest to match Owens with a convincing win in the 100 m, running 9.99 s to defeat his nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by 0.2 s. In his next event, the long jump, Lewis won with relative ease. His behavior in winning this event stoked controversy, even as knowledgeable observers agreed that his tactics were correct.[33] Since Lewis still had heats and finals in the 200 m and the 4 × 100 m relay to compete in, he chose to take as few jumps as necessary to win the event. He risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if he over-extended himself, and his ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. He knew that his first jump at 8.54 m (28 ft 0 in) was sufficient to win the event. He fouled on his next jump and then passed on his remaining four allotted jumps. Lewis easily won gold, and Gary Honey of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of 8.24 m (27 ft 1⁄4 in). The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis's quest to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of 8.90 m (29 ft 2+1⁄4 in). Lewis himself had often stated it was a goal of his to surpass the mark. A television advertisement with Beamon appeared before the final, featuring the record-holder saying, \"I hope you make it, kid.\"[34] So, when Lewis decided not to make any more attempts to try to break the record, he was loudly booed. When asked about those boos, Lewis said, \"I was shocked at first. But after I thought about it, I realized that they were booing because they wanted to see more of Carl Lewis. I guess that's flattering.\"[35]\n\n\nHis third gold medal came in the 200 m, where he won with a time of 19.80 s, a new Olympic record and the third fastest time in history. Finally, he won his fourth gold in the 4 × 100 m relay when he anchored the final leg of the race; he broke the tape with a time of 37.83 s, setting a new world record.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Lack of endorsements and public perception[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, he did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that he had expected. The long jump controversy was one reason and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars: \"He rubs it in too much\", said Edwin Moses, twice Olympic gold medalist in the 400 m hurdles. \"A little humility is in order. That's what Carl lacks.\"[36] Further, Lewis's agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well. Douglas said he was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public's perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.[37]\n\n\nAdditionally, rumors circulated at that time that Lewis was gay, and though Lewis denied the rumors, they probably hurt his marketability as well. Lewis' physical appearance at the Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to the reports. \"It doesn't matter what Carl Lewis' sexuality is\", high jumper Dwight Stones said. \"Madison Avenue perceives him as homosexual.\"[38] Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to Lewis before the Olympics, but Lewis and Douglas turned it down, confident that Lewis would be worth more after the Olympics. But Coca-Cola rescinded the offer after the Games. Nike already had Lewis under contract for several years, despite questions about how it affected his amateur status, and he was appearing in Nike television advertisements in print and on billboards. Nike was faced with Lewis's new negative image and dropped him after the Games. \"If you're a male athlete, I think the American public wants you to look macho\", said Don Coleman, a Nike representative.[37] \"They started looking for ways to get rid of me\", Lewis said. \"Everyone there was so scared and so cynical they did not know what to do.\" Lewis and Nike eventually did split, and Lewis signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno. Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the \"Carl bashing\", as he put it, typified by a *Sports Illustrated* article before the Olympics.[37]\n\n\nAt year's end, Lewis was again awarded the top rankings in the 100 m and the long jump and was additionally ranked number one in the 200 m, and for the third year in a row he was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by *Track & Field News*.\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls drafted Lewis in the 1984 NBA draft as the 208th overall pick, although he had played neither high school nor college basketball. Lewis never played in the NBA. A poll on the NBA's website ranked Lewis second to Lusia Harris, the only woman to be drafted by the NBA, as the most unusual pick in the history of the NBA Draft. Ron Weiss, the head West Coast scout of the Bulls, and Ken Passon, the assistant West Coast scout, recommended Lewis because he was the best athlete available.[39] Similarly, Lewis was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys as a wide receiver in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL Draft, even though he did not play football in college. He never played in the NFL either.[40]\n\n\n\n### Ben Johnson and the 1987 World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1984 Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which he would remain undefeated for the next seven years, but others started to challenge his dominance in the 100 m sprint. His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96 s shortly before the 1984 Olympics,[41] but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second.[12] In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95 s. At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly. Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61 m (28 ft 2+3⁄4 in).[9]\n\n\nAt the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Lewis skipped the 200 m to focus on his strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history's second 29 ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan leapt 8.86 m (29 ft 3⁄4 in) at altitude in May, just 4 cm short of Bob Beamon's record.[42] But Emmiyan's best that day was a leap of 8.53 m (27 ft 11+3⁄4 in), second to Lewis' 8.67 m (28 ft 5+1⁄4 in).[43] Lewis cleared 8.60 m (28 ft 2+1⁄2 in) four times. \nIn the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored the gold-medal team to a time of 37.90 s, the third-fastest of all time.[44]\n\n\nThe 100 m final was the most talked about event and caused the most drama. Johnson had run under 10.00 s three times in the year before Rome,[45] while Lewis had not managed to get under the 10.00 s barrier at all. Lewis looked strong in the heats of the 100 m, setting a Championship record in the semi-final while running into a wind with a 10.03 s effort.[46] In the final, however, Johnson won with a time that stunned observers: 9.83 s, a new world record. Lewis, second with 9.93 s, had tied the existing world record, but that was insufficient.[47]\n\n\nWhile Johnson basked in the glory of his achievement, Lewis started to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said \"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs.\" He added, \"I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.\"[48] This was the start of Lewis's calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. His detractors noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Johnson replied \"When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won't complain about that either\".[49]\n\n\n\n### 1988 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nLewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father. When William Lewis died of cancer at age 60, Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100 m in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him. \"Don't worry\", he told his mother. \"I'll get another one.\"[50] Lewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. \"A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father. That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season\", he said, after defeating Johnson in Zürich on August 17.[51]\n\n\nThe 100 m final at the 1988 Summer Olympics was one of the most sensational sports stories of the year and its unexpected outcome would rank as one of the most infamous sports stories of the century.[52] Johnson won in 9.79 s, a new world record, while Lewis set a new American record with 9.92 s. Three days later, Johnson tested positive for steroids, his medal was taken away and Lewis was awarded gold and credited with a new Olympic record.[53]\n\n\nIn the long jump, Robert Emmiyan withdrew from the competition citing an injury, and Lewis's main challengers were rising American long jump star Mike Powell and long-time rival Larry Myricks. Lewis leapt 8.72 m (28 ft 7+1⁄4 in), a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of his competitors could match it. The Americans swept the medals in the event for the first time in 84 years. In the 200 m, Lewis dipped under his Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to Joe DeLoach, who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event he entered, the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.[54]\n\n\nA subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100 m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100 m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the \"true\" world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Zürich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records.[55] From January 1, 1990, Lewis was the world record holder in the 100 m.[56] The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break Lewis's mark.[57] Lewis also permanently lost his ranking as number one for the 200 m in 1988 and for the 100 m in 1989.[30][58] He also lost the top ranking for the long jump in 1990 but was able to regain it in 1992.[9]\n\n\n\n### 1991 World Championships: Lewis' greatest performances[edit]\n\n\nTokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100 m final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart.[12] In what would be the deepest 100 meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents, he reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s.[59] Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he had crossed the line with \"WR\" beside his name on the giant television screens, and the first time he could savor his achievement at the moment it occurred. He could be seen with tears in his eyes afterwards. \"The best race of my life\", Lewis said. \"The best technique, the fastest. And I did it at thirty.\"[36] Lewis's world record would stand for nearly three years.[55] Lewis also anchored the 4 × 100 m relay team to another world record, 37.50 s, the third time that year he had anchored a 4 × 100 m squad to a world record.\n\n\n\n#### Long jump showdown versus Powell[edit]\n\n\nThe 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport.[60] Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. Lewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which he competed. Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls[61] or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt.[62][63]\n\n\nLewis' first jump was 8.68 m (28 ft 5+1⁄2 in), a World Championship record, and a mark bested by only three others beside Lewis all-time. Powell, jumping first, had faltered in the first round, but jumped 8.54 m (28 ft 0 in) to claim second place in the second round.[64] Lewis jumped 8.83 m (28 ft 11+1⁄2 in), a wind-aided leap, in the third round, a mark that would have won all but two long jump competitions in history. Powell responded with a long foul, estimated to be around 8.80 m (28 ft 10+1⁄4 in). Lewis's next jump made history: the first leap ever beyond Bob Beamon's record. The wind gauge indicated the jump was wind-aided, so it could not be considered a record, but it would still count in the competition. 8.91 m (29 ft 2+3⁄4 in) was the greatest leap ever under any condition.[64]\n\n\nIn the next round, Powell responded. His jump was measured as 8.95 m (29 ft 4+1⁄4 in); this time, his jump was not a foul, and with a wind gauge measurement of 0.3 m/s, well within the legal allowable for a record. Powell had not only jumped 4 cm further than Lewis, he had eclipsed the 23-year-old mark set by Bob Beamon and done so at low altitude.[64] Lewis still had two jumps left, although he was now no longer chasing Beamon, but Powell. He leaped 8.87 m (29 ft 1 in), which was a new personal best under legal wind conditions, then a final jump of 8.84 m (29 ft 0 in). He thus lost his first long jump competition in a decade.[65] Powell's 8.95 m (29 ft 4+1⁄4 in) and Lewis's final two jumps still stand as of May 2021 as the top three low altitude jumps ever. The farthest anyone has jumped since under legal conditions is 8.74 m (28 ft 8 in).[66]\n\n\nLewis' reaction to what was one of the greatest competitions ever in the sport was to offer acknowledgment of the achievement of Powell.[64] \"He just did it\", Lewis said of Powell's winning jump. \"It was that close, and it was the best of his life.\"[67] Powell did jump as far or farther on two subsequent occasions, though both were wind-aided jumps at altitude: 8.99 m (29 ft 5+3⁄4 in) in 1992 and 8.95 m (29 ft 4+1⁄4 in) in 1994.[68] Lewis's best subsequent results were two wind-aided leaps at 8.72 m (28 ft 7+1⁄4 in), and an 8.68 m (28 ft 5+1⁄2 in) under legal conditions while in the qualifying rounds at the Barcelona Olympics.[69]\n\n\nIn reference to his efforts at the 1991 World Championships, Lewis said, \"This has been the greatest meet that I've ever had.\"[70] *Track and Field News* was prepared to go even further than that, suggesting that after these Championships, \"It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field.\"[70] Lewis's 1991 outstanding results earned him the ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, an award he shared with gymnastics star Kim Zmeskal.\n\n\n\n### Final years and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis in Washington, D.C. in 1996\nAfter the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Though he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 × 200 m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992,[71] he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100 m or 200 m. In the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track.[72] Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4 × 100 m relay team. At the Games in Barcelona, Lewis jumped 8.67 m (28 ft 5+1⁄4 in) in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell who did a final-round 8.64 m (28 ft 4 in). In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 s, a time which stood for 16 years. He covered the final leg in 8.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg.[73]\n\n\nLewis competed at the 4th World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993, but finished fourth in the 100 m,[74] and did not compete in the long jump. He did, however, earn his first World Championship medal in the 200 m, a bronze with his 19.99 s performance.[75] That medal would prove to be his final Olympic or World Championship medal in a running event. Injuries kept Lewis largely sidelined for the next few years, then he made a comeback for the 1996 season.\n\n\nIn 1996, Lewis qualified for the Olympic team in the long jump for the fifth time, the first time an American man has done so.[76] At the 1996 Olympics, injuries to world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iván Pedroso, affected their performances. Lewis, on the other hand, was in good form. Though he did not match past performances, his third-round leap of 8.50 m (27 ft 10+1⁄2 in) won gold by 0.21 m (8+1⁄4 in) over second-place finisher James Beckford of Jamaica.[77] He became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times,[78] joining Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm and American discus thrower Al Oerter; the three would be joined by American swimmer Michael Phelps in 2016. Lewis's nine gold medals also tie him for second on the list of multiple Olympic gold medalists with Paavo Nurmi, Larisa Latynina, and Mark Spitz behind Phelps.[79]\n\n\nLewis' 8.50 m (27 ft 10+1⁄2 in) jump was also officially declared tied with Larry Myricks for the masters record for the 35–39 age group.[80]\n\n\nControversy struck when, as *Track and Field News* put it, \"Lewis' attitude in the whole relay hoo-hah a few days later served only to take the luster off his final gold.\"[77] After Lewis's unexpected long jump gold, it was noted that he could become the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals if he entered the 4 × 100 m relay team. Any member of the American Olympic men's track and field team could be used, even if they had not qualified for the relay event. Lewis said, \"If they asked me, I'd run it in a second. But they haven't asked me to run it.\" He further suggested on *Larry King Live* that viewers phone the United States Olympic Committee to weigh in on the situation. Lewis had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to exclude Lewis from the team. Olympic team coach Erv Hunt said, \"The basis of their [the relay team's] opinion was 'We want to run, we worked our butts off and we deserve to be here.'\"[77] The American relay team finished second behind Canada.[81]\n\n\nLewis retired from track and field in 1997.\n\n\n\n## Use of stimulants[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to *Sports Illustrated* that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete. Before showing the documents to *Sports Illustrated*, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.[82][83]\n\n\nLewis was among the named athletes and Exum's documents revealed that at the 1988 Olympics trials he had three positive results on a combined test for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. All were and are banned in sport due to their activity as stimulants, though at the time all three were available over-the-counter as dietary supplements or treatments for cold and allergy symptoms. The combined concentrations of these stimulants detected in the three successive tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.[82]\n\n\nLewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain *ma huang*, the Chinese name for *Ephedra sinica*, an ephedrine-bearing plant which was then marketed as a weight loss aid.[82] Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.[84][85]\n\n\nThe highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances.[82][86] According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed in 2003 that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\"[82]\n\n\nFollowing Exum's revelations the IAAF affirmed that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. The federation also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with the athletes' names undisclosed and stated that \"the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as 'negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken\".[87][88]\n\n\n\"Carl did nothing wrong. There was never intent. He was never told 'you violated the rules,'\" said Martin D. Singer, Lewis's lawyer, who also said that Lewis had inadvertently taken the banned stimulants in an over-the-counter herbal remedy.[89] In an April 2003 interview, Lewis agreed that he tested positive three times in 1988 but he was let off as that was the normal practice in those times.[90] \"The only thing I can say is I think it's unfortunate what Wade Exum is trying to do\", said Lewis. \"I don't know what people are trying to make out of nothing because everyone was treated the same, so what are we talking about? I don't get it.\"[91]\n\n\n\n## Achievements and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Azerbaijan stamp honoring Lewis, issued in 1996\n* Lewis is the only man to successfully defend an Olympic long jump title.\n* Outdoors, Lewis jumped 14 of the 20 furthest ancillary jumps of all time.

Among them, he played himself in cameos in *Perfect Strangers*, *Speed Zone*, *Alien Hunter* and *Material Girls*. He made an appearance on *The Weakest Link*. He also played Stu in the made-for-TV movie *Atomic Twister*.\n\n\nIn 2011, Lewis appeared in the short documentary *Challenging Impossibility* which features the feats of strength demonstrated by the late spiritual teacher and peace advocate Sri Chinmoy.[96]\nLewis also appeared in the film *The Last Adam* (2006).\n\n\n\n### Bid for New Jersey State Senate[edit]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2011, Lewis filed petitions to run as a Democrat for New Jersey Senate in the state's 8th legislative district in Burlington County.[97] Two weeks later he was disqualified by Lieutenant Governor and secretary of state, Kim Guadagno, as he did not meet the state's requirement that Senate candidates live in New Jersey for four years.[98] Lewis appealed his decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; the court initially granted his appeal but a few days later the court reversed itself and Lewis withdrew his name.[99][100]\n\n\n\n### Coaching[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2018, Lewis serves as an assistant track coach at his alma mater, the University of Houston.[101]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLewis has a son named Bakim, who is a singer songwriter and lives in Houston, Texas.[102]\n\n\nLewis became a vegan in 1990, during his late twenties, and has credited his outstanding 1991 results in part to his vegan diet.[103] He has said that it is better suited to him because he can eat a larger quantity without affecting his athleticism, and he believes that switching to a vegan diet can lead to improved athletic performance.[104]\n\n\nLewis sang a memorable rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during the 1993 NBA Finals.[105]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of vegans\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* 100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Evans, Hilary; Gjerde, Arild; Heijmans, Jeroen; Mallon, Bill; et al. \"Carl Lewis\". *Olympics at Sports-Reference.com*.

He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*née* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montréal.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.[122] His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4×100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and László Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", Čavić said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] Čavić later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic. It goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest Olympian of all time, he's maybe the greatest athlete of all time. He's the greatest racer who ever walked the planet. (2008)\n |\n| —Mark Spitz (on Phelps winning his 7th gold medal)[159] |\n\n\nPhelps's seventh gold medal of the Games tied Mark Spitz's record for gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, set in the 1972 Olympics. It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched László Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fiancée Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012–13 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and László Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 × 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4×100 free\n | 4×200 free\n | 4×100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.[293] *im* is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America[293] and through Special Olympics International.[294] The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.[297][298] Phelps stated he hoped to work with his Foundation more after retirement from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[299]\n\n\nIn 2017, Phelps joined the board of Medibio, a company focused on diagnosis of mental health disorders.[300]\n\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[*citation needed*] However, Johnny Weissmuller is reported to have broken 67 official world records.[301]\n\n\nAll but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. As of July 23, 2023[update], he holds world records in two events (indicated in **bold**), after his last standing individual world record in 400m IM was broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Distance\n | Event\n | Time\n | Location\n | Date\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly | 1:54.92\n | Austin, Texas, US\n | March 30, 2001 | [302] |\n| 2\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly (2)\n | 1:54.58\n | Fukuoka, Japan\n | July 24, 2001 | [302] |\n| 3\n | 400 m\n | Individual medley | 4:11.09\n | Ft.

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

He was called the \"Flying Finn\" or the \"Phantom Finn\", as he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.\n\n\nBorn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals,[3] although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.\n\n\nStruggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.\n\n\nNurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the \"even pace\" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi (second from right) with  \nhis family in 1924\nNurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine.[4] Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively.[5] In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932.[5] The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb.[4] They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day.[6] By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02.[4] Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later.[5] The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room.[4] Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery.[5] Although he stopped running actively,[4] he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku.[7] He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.[7]\n\n\nAt 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to \"have run Finland onto the map of the world\" at the 1912 Summer Olympics.[8] He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later.[6] Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters.[4] In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres.[9] Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics.[4] He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab.

Ahlberg & Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919.[4] During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions.[4] After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.[4]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1920 Olympic trials\nIn the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand.[9] Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers,[9] despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial.[10] As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice.[4] Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs.[4] Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection.[9] In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (*alikersantti*).[4] On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and went on to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.[8][11]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\n### 1920–1924 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1924 Summer Olympics\nNurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.[9] He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics.[8] He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute,[12] the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku.[5] Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.[9]\n\n\nBuoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously.[13] Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance.[14] He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless.[13] Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921.[15] In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m.[14] A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile.[14] His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since.[8] Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record.[16] After excelling in mathematics,[17] Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.[5][9]\n\n\nNurmi's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day.[16] On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances.[18] In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster.[18] His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe,[18] still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds.[19] The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m.[18] Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace.[20][21] Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass.[20] The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel.[18] On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.[18]\n\n\nIn the cross country events, the heat of 45 °C (113 °F),[22] caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race.[18] Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers.[18] One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious.[23] Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital.[24][25] Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half.[18] As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward.[26] An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line.[26] After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold.[18][26] Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.[27]\n\n\nIn the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth.[18] Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him.[18][28] After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years.[28] He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.[29]\n\n\n\n### U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi, right, and Joie Ray, left, with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge during Nurmi's 1925 U.S. tour\nIn early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January.[30] His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris.[30] Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances.[30] Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances.[30] He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich.[30][31] Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards.[32] Although he hated losing more than anything,[33] Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich.[31] The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.[34] Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.[35]\n\n\nNurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems.[9] He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively.[9] As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland.[9] In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm,[29] despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide.[36] Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again.[37] In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer.[38] This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m.[32] In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna.[39] Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics.[40] At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances.[41] He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before,[41] the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.[42]\n\n\nAt the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight.[43] Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase.[43] He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot.[43] Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused.[43] In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead.[43] Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver.[43] Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day.[43] Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance.[43] On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record.[43] Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.[43]\n\n\n\n### Move to longer distances[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi checks his stopwatch in 1928\nNurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\"[8] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin.[15] Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945.[44] In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn.[45] He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile.[46][47] Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925,[46] and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him.[48] In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km.[15] In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles.[49][50] He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes.[49] Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\"[51]\n\n\nIn April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation.[52] The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing,[52] but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch,[53] and the Associated Press wrote that \"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\"[52] A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism.[53] Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.[54]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi running his first and only \"Short\" marathon 40.2 km (25.0 mi)at the 1932 Olympic trials in Viipuri\nOn 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25.0 mi) in 2:22:03.8 – on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00,[55] just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes.[56] Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon.[57] Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon.[55] The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon.[58] *The Guardian* reported that \"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\"[23] and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury.[8] Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.[59]\n\n\n\n### 1932 Olympics and later career[edit]\n\n\nLess than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles.[60] Sigfrid Edström, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4.[61] and 7/30/1932.[62] [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edström and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi's ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.][63][64]\nEdström stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case.[60] The AP called this \"one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history\", and wrote that the Games would now be \"like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.\"[65] Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki.[66] Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931.[65] The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be \"unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.\"[67] The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\"[68]\n\n\nOn the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted.[69] Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition.[69] However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially.[69] Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier,[70] Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes.[8] The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote.[71] However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm.[71] Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status,[72] and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden.[73] A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international.[74] After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.[72]\n\n\nNurmi refused to turn professional,[75] and continued running as an amateur in Finland.[8] In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926.[76][77] At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost.[78] The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code.[78] With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite.[78] Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934.[8] Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career.[79] In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.[80]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in his men's clothing store in Helsinki in 1939\nWhile active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods.[81] Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him.[81] Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him.[81] After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.[16] In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden.[82] However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games.[16][83] In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki.[84] It became a popular tourist attraction,[85] and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi.[86] The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction.[84] As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each.[87] Within five years, he was rated a millionaire.[85] His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price.[59] Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.[88]\n\n\nIn February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé Taisto Mäki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause.[8] The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and Mäki.[89] Hoover welcomed the two as \"ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.\"[90] While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar Höckert, had been killed in action.[91] Nurmi left for Finland in late April,[92] and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff.[93] Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (*ylikersantti*) and later to a sergeant first class (*vääpeli*).[93]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi lights the Olympic Flame in 1952\nIn 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.[88] His appearance astonished the spectators, and *Sports Illustrated* wrote that \"his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.\"[94] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower.[59] In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.[95]\n\n\nNurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman,[9] but his interest in running never died.[96] He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War.[97] Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club.[98] In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: \"The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'\"[99] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something.[100] Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala.[96] He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Paavo Nurmi in the early 1970s\nAlthough he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964,[101] Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews.[102] On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer.[103] Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art.[104] He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral.[28] Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: \"People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.\"[59] At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin,[9] Konsta Jylhä's *Vaiennut viulu* (*The Silenced Violin*) was played during the ceremony.[105] Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.[106]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in a calisthenic pose\nNurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907–1968) from 1932 to 1935.[84] Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, \"[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.\"[107] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a \"self-made\" businessman.[87] Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed \"uneasy\".[87] Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career.[87] As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father's time.[87] In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the \"three Olavis\" (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.[87] Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon \"Vampira\", was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi's niece.[108] However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.[108]\n\n\nNurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924.[109] He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21.[109] Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be \"taciturn\", \"stony-faced\" and \"stubborn\".[9] He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his \"sarcastic sense of humour\" among the small circles he knew.[9] Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak,[110] Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media,[9] stating later on his 75th birthday, \"[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.\"[87] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi \"is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.\"[111] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him *Suuri vaikenija* (The Great Silent One),[112] and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: \"Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer.[38][113] Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: \"Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.\"[38] Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: \"Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.\"[114] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that \"in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.\"[115] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: \"He grabbed ahold of me — he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!\"[116]\n\n\nNurmi's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", the \"King of Runners\" and \"Peerless Paavo\",[8][117][118] while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine.[119] One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi \"a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.\"[120] Phil Cousineau noted that \"his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.\"[120] Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a \"freakish heart\" with a very low pulse rate.[121] During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have \"the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.\"[118]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Wäinö Aaltonen and Paavo Nurmi with Aaltonen's bronze statue of Nurmi in the Ateneum museum in the late 1930s\nNurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km; a record in running.[15][122] He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58.[87] His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s.[15] Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008.[123] Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.[124] *Time* selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996,[125] and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.[126]\n\n\nNurmi introduced the \"even pace\" strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race.[127] He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\"[118] Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\"[128] Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running.[129][130] Peter Lovesey wrote in *The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners* that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\"[81] Cordner Nelson, founder of *Track & Field News*, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man’s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi's achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Zátopek chanted \"I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!\" when he trained as a child,[87] and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi's methods.[131] Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died.[115] Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could \"repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.\"[132] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games.[132] Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem *Olympic Laurel* that included a verse on Nurmi.[133] In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse *Nurmi* won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.[133]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi on the ten-mark bill\nA bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925.[134] The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.[134] In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship *Vasa* when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961.[135] Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work *Löpare* (*Runners*) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide.[133] *Boken om Nurmi* (*The Book about Nurmi*), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman.[133] Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939,[136] while Finnair named its first DC-8 *Paavo Nurmi* in 1969.[137] Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.[133]\n\n\nPaavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest.[138] In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957.[139] Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi.[140] A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987.[141] The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively.[141] The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993.[141] In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the *Paavo Nurmi Stadium*.[133] Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m.[142] In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel *Marathon Man* as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi.[143] The opera on Nurmi, *Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.*, written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000.[144] In a 2005 episode of *The Simpsons*, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.[145] The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.[146][147]\n\n\n\n## Career summary (1920–34)[edit]\n\n\n### Seasons[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi beats Wide to a win in Stockholm, July 1926.\n![refer to

He was the most successful competitor at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. This achievement set a record that lasted for 36 years, until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial.[1][2] *Swimming World Magazine* named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was born on February 10, 1950, in Modesto, California, the first of three children[3] of Lenore Sylvia (Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed \"Sklotkovick\", were from Russia.[4][5][6] When Spitz was two years old, his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. \"You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide,\" Lenore Spitz told a reporter for *Time* in 1968.[3] At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored six other Olympic medal winners.\n\n\nAt only 10, Spitz held one world age-group record and 17 national records.[7] When Spitz was 14, his family moved to Santa Clara, where he joined the Santa Clara Swim Club and was trained by coach George F. Haines.[7] From 1964 to 1968, Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance.[*citation needed*] In 1966 at age 16, he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 total AAU titles. The following year, Spitz emerged on the world swimming stage when he set his first world record at a small California meet with a time of 4:10.60 in the 400-meter freestyle.[8]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Maccabiah Games[edit]\n\n\nSpitz swam in his first international competition at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At age 15 and weighing 130 pounds, he won four gold medals in Tel Aviv—the 400 m freestyle, the 1,500 freestyle, the 400 m individual medley, and the 800 m freestyle relay, and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games.[3][9][10]\n\n\nHe returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete, at the 1969 Maccabiah Games. This time, he won six gold medals.[*citation needed*] He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.[11]\n\n\nIn 1985, Spitz lit the torch to open the 1985 Maccabiah Games.[12]\n\n\nIn 2005, he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 2005 Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games, with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.\n\n\n\n### Pan American Games[edit]\n\n\nHe won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira, won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### 1968 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1968 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz c. 1968\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1968 Mexico City |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:31.7\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:52.3\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 56.40\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 53.00\n |\n\n\nSpitz was already the holder of ten world records, and he brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33.[13] In addition, Spitz finished second to fellow American Doug Russell in the 100-meter butterfly. He lost to Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.[14] Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance.\n\n\n\n### College training[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance. in January 1969, he decided to attend Indiana University[2] to train with legendary Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman,[15] who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman \"the biggest decision of my life (and) the best.\"[16] While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972.\n\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Mark the Shark\" by his teammates.\n\n\n\n### 1972 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics and 1972 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz at the 1972 Olympics\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1972 Munich |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 2:00.70 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:26.42 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:52.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 54.27 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:35.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 51.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley relay  | 3:48.16 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz was back to repeat his quest for the six gold medals. He did even better, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Furthermore, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Spitz was originally reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing that he would not win the gold medal. Minutes before the race, he confessed on the pool deck to ABC's Donna de Varona, \"I know I say I don't want to swim before every event, but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure.\" Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacket worn by Mark Spitz during the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nSpitz is one of five Olympians to win nine or more career gold medals: Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis also have nine;[18] only Phelps has won more with 23. Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Phelps broke the record at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nAfter he had completed his events, Spitz left Munich early as a result of the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and later murdered by Palestinian terrorists.[19][20] Being Jewish himself, there was concern among the Olympic authorities that Spitz would become a likely target for the Palestinians and he was escorted to London for his own safety.[21][22][23] It is believed that he was escorted out of the country by US Marines stationed in West Germany.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was only 22 years old.[24]\n\n\nAt age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after filmmaker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying.[25] Spitz's comeback attempt made the cover of *Parade* and was also reported on in *Sports Illustrated* and *Esquire*.[26] Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz was two seconds slower than the Olympic standard and failed to qualify.[25]\n\n\nIn 1999, Spitz ranked No. 33 on *ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes*, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.[27]\n\n\n\n## Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\n* International Swimming Hall of Fame, Inducted 1977.[28]\n* International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 1979.[29]\n* United States Olympic Hall of Fame, Inducted 1983.[30]\n* Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Inducted 1990.[31]\n* San Jose Sports Hall of Fame, inducted Wednesday, November 14, 2007.[32][33]\n* National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007.[34]\n* Long Beach City College Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007[35]\n* Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame[36]\n\n\n## Film and television career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz retired from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while he was still a household name due to his athletic success.[37]\n\n\nA poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable.[38]\n\n\nIn Spitz's TV debut, he appeared as himself in a skit as a dentist on a Bob Hope special that aired October 5, 1972. In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* and *The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour*. On the TV drama *Emergency!*, he portrayed Pete Barlow, whose wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy) is accidentally shot by a handgun in an overfull drawer. He also appeared briefly on *The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast* of California Governor Ronald Reagan in September 1973.\n\n\nSpitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[39] In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in *Challenge of a Lifetime*. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure[38] except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.[38]\n\n\n\n### Narration[edit]\n\n\nSpitz narrated *Freedom's Fury*, a 2006 Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's Blood in the Water match against the Soviet Union during the Revolution of 1956—considered among the most famous water polo matches.[40] The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu,[41] and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.[40]\n\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\nHe appeared in an advertisement for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption \"I always drink it--is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers.\"\n\n\nIn 1974, he was in a number of Schick razors commercials.[42] In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation.\n\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS.[43] Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard's first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996 and 2004). The ad was entitled \"Shock\".[44] Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the \"Orbitrek Elite\" fitness workout.[45]\n\n\nIn 2012, Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2019 commercial, Spitz pitched a personal EKG device by KardiaMobile.[46]\n\n\nIn 2022, Spitz endorsed the health supplement Relief Factor.[47]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz and Suzy Weiner on their wedding day in May 1973\n![](image)Spitz (far right) and his wife (far left) with President Gerald Ford and First Lady Betty Ford in 1976\nWhen Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father's business acquaintances.[38][48] Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973,[45] in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel.[42] They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin was a member of the Stanford swim team.[39][49] Spitz and his wife reside in Los Angeles, California.[50][51]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAt Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, Spitz was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. *Time* magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. \"I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there.\"[52] Spitz graduated from Indiana University in 1972.[53][54]\n\n\n\n### Post-swimming career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz's return to the United States following the 1972 Olympics, he landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.[55] \"A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today,\" Spitz said in 2007. \"I did very well, thank you very much.\"[56] Spitz added, \"I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts.\"[57] Spitz went on to start a real estate company.[58]\n\n\nPer his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker.[59] According to one interview, \"Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the 'water business', as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.\"[60]\n\n\nSpitz has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry. He travels the world, delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, *The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion* by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.[61]\n\n\nIn July 2012, he endorsed Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the award went to Tokyo.[62]\n\n\n\n### Hobbies[edit]\n\n\nHis hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.[63]\n\n\n\n### Famous moustache during Olympics[edit]\n\n\nIn an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated \"I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one.\"[52] Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. \"It took a long time to grow,\" he said.[64] It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a \"good-luck piece\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMark Spitz is quoted as saying, \"When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.'\nAccording to a *Sports Illustrated* article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. \"He looked great with it, don't get me wrong,\" explained his wife Suzy, \"but he looks so handsome without it.\"[65]\n\n\nWhen he was asked why he shaved it off he responded \"well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache ... I'm happy [without it].\"[66] He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz stating that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become \"too gray\",\n\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\nAfter retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.[67] \"During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming,\" says Spitz. \"It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening.\"\n\n\nHe has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.[68] \"People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact,\" said Spitz. \"I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down.\" He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.[69]\n\n\n\n## Olympic controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 1972 medal podium incident[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following his victory in the 200-meter freestyle, Spitz carried his shoes and arrived barefoot to obtain his gold medal. He put them down as the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played. After the anthem, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.[7]\n\n\n\n### Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSpitz has said that he felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven-gold-medal record: \"I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. ... I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is.\"[59] Spitz added, \"They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me,\" he said. \"Yes, I am a bit upset about it.\"[70] Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz, throwing first pitch at a baseball game (2008)\nHowever, on August 14, 2008, Spitz appeared on NBC's *Today Show* where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps:\n\n\n\n\n> It's about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I'm very happy for him. I really, truly am ... I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.[72]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, *Today in L.A.*, Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that \"Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever.\"[73]\n\n\nOn August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps's performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was \"epic\". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:\n\n\n\n\n> You know, Bob and Michael, I wondered what I was going to say at this monumental time, when it would happen and who I would say it to, and of course I thought I was going to say it to you for some time now. But, it's the word that comes to mind, \"epic\". What you did tonight was epic, and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are. I never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention, because I watched you at Athens win the race by similar margins, and 18 months ago at the World's by similar margins. And, you know, that is a tribute to your greatness. And now the whole world knows. We are so proud of you Michael here in America, and we are so proud of you and the way that you handle yourself, and you represent such an inspiration to all the youngsters around the world. You know, you weren't born when I did what I did, and I'm sure that I was a part of your inspiration, and I take that as a full compliment. And they say that you judge one's character by the company you keep, and I'm happy to keep company with you. And you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years, and I know that you will wear the crown well. Congratulations, Mike.[74]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2015, Spitz allegedly claimed that he had seen an email from Omega, the official timekeeper, that Phelps had lost the closely contested 100m butterfly final in 2008.[75] He later claimed that his quote had been \"misconstrued\".[76]\n\n\n\n### Views on drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMark Spitz has been consistent in his criticism of the two swimming world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its \"embarrassing\" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.[77]\n\n\nDuring a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying \"They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing.\"[78]\n\n\nIn August 2008, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying \"the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Olympics portal\n\n\n* List of Indiana University (Bloomington) people\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n* List of select Jewish swimmers\n* List of top Olympic gold medalists in swimming\n* World record progression 100 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 100 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 200 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 200 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 400 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 4 × 100 metres medley relay\n* World record progression 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame\".

His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only six Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.\n\n\nLewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set world records in the 100 m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relays, while his world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke 10 seconds for the 100 meters fifteen times and 20 seconds for the 200 meters ten times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet seventy-one times.\n\n\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the International Olympic Committee, \"Olympian of the Century\" by *Sports Illustrated* and \"Athlete of the Year\" by *Track & Field News* in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\n\nAfter retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a Democrat in the New Jersey Senate, but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.\n\n\n\n\n## Athletic career[edit]\n\n\n### Fame as a competitive athlete[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis performing the long jump as a University of Houston college athlete\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927–1987)[2] and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team.[3] His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues.[4] His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both him and his sister, Carol.[5] She became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[6]\n\n\nLewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status.[5] At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey.[3][7] He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.[3]\n\n\nMany colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis's coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in).[8] By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to *Track and Field News*.[9]\n\n\nAn old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35 m (27 ft 4+1⁄2 in).[3]\n\n\nThough his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team.[3] The Olympic boycott precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow; he instead participated in the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77 m (25 ft 5+3⁄4 in) for a bronze medal, and the American 4 × 100 m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61 s.[10] He received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the athletes precluded from competing in the 1980 Olympics.[11] At year's end, he was ranked sixth in the world in the long jump and seventh in the 100 m.[9][12]\n\n\n\n### Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982[edit]\n\n\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 m (28 ft 3+1⁄4 in) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.[13]\n\n\nWhile marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records,[14] Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level. In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, \"I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don't want that '(A)' [for altitude] after the mark.\"[15] When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men's 100 m and 200 m records and the long jump record had been set at the high altitude of Mexico City.[14]\n\n\nAlso in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100 m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67 s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00 s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.[16] For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100 m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100 m and long jump. Additionally, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.[17]\n\n\nIn 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge Bob Beamon's world record of 8.90 m (29 ft 2+1⁄4 in) in the long jump set at the 1968 Olympics, a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever.[18] Before Lewis, 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and 1980 Olympic champion Lutz Dombrowski. During 1982, Lewis cleared 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.76 m (28 ft 8+3⁄4 in) at Indianapolis on July 24.[19] He also ran 10.00 s in the 100 m, the world's fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00 s clocking the same weekend he leapt 8.61 m (28 ft 2+3⁄4 in) twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record 8.76 m (28 ft 8+3⁄4 in) at Indianapolis, he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon's record, the third which several observers said reached 30 ft 0 in (9.14 m). Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.[20]\n\n\nHe repeated his number one ranking in the 100 m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200 m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by *Track and Field News*. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100 m ranking six times (seven if Ben Johnson's 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third.[12] His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.[9]\n\n\n\n### 1983 and the inaugural World Championships[edit]\n\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first World Championships in 1983. Lewis' chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55 m (28 ft 1⁄2 in) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26 m (10 in).[21]\n\n\nHe also won the 100 m with relative ease. There, Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100 m at altitude with a 9.93 s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07 s to 10.21 s.[22] Smith won the 200 m title,[23] an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis' shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200 m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03 s behind Pietro Mennea's 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he did not ease off in the final meters to raise his arms in celebration.[24][25] Finally, Lewis ran the anchor in the 4 × 100 m relay, winning in 37.86 s, a new world record and the first in Lewis' career.[26]\n\n\nLewis' year-best performances in the 100 m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100 m at low-altitude with a 9.97 s in Modesto on May 14.[27][28] His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith's world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79 m (28 ft 10 in)[24] and earned the world number one ranking in that event.[29] *Track and Field News* ranked him number two in the 200 m, despite his low-altitude record of 19.75 s, behind Smith, who had won gold at Helsinki.[30] Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1984 Summer Olympics: emulating Jesse Owens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis sprinting at the 1984 Summer Olympics\nAt the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of them and thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin.[32]\n\n\nLewis started his quest to match Owens with a convincing win in the 100 m, running 9.99 s to defeat his nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by 0.2 s. In his next event, the long jump, Lewis won with relative ease. His behavior in winning this event stoked controversy, even as knowledgeable observers agreed that his tactics were correct.[33] Since Lewis still had heats and finals in the 200 m and the 4 × 100 m relay to compete in, he chose to take as few jumps as necessary to win the event. He risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if he over-extended himself, and his ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. He knew that his first jump at 8.54 m (28 ft 0 in) was sufficient to win the event. He fouled on his next jump and then passed on his remaining four allotted jumps. Lewis easily won gold, and Gary Honey of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of 8.24 m (27 ft 1⁄4 in). The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis's quest to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of 8.90 m (29 ft 2+1⁄4 in). Lewis himself had often stated it was a goal of his to surpass the mark. A television advertisement with Beamon appeared before the final, featuring the record-holder saying, \"I hope you make it, kid.\"[34] So, when Lewis decided not to make any more attempts to try to break the record, he was loudly booed. When asked about those boos, Lewis said, \"I was shocked at first. But after I thought about it, I realized that they were booing because they wanted to see more of Carl Lewis. I guess that's flattering.\"[35]\n\n\nHis third gold medal came in the 200 m, where he won with a time of 19.80 s, a new Olympic record and the third fastest time in history. Finally, he won his fourth gold in the 4 × 100 m relay when he anchored the final leg of the race; he broke the tape with a time of 37.83 s, setting a new world record.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Lack of endorsements and public perception[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, he did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that he had expected. The long jump controversy was one reason and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars: \"He rubs it in too much\", said Edwin Moses, twice Olympic gold medalist in the 400 m hurdles. \"A little humility is in order. That's what Carl lacks.\"[36] Further, Lewis's agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well. Douglas said he was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public's perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.[37]\n\n\nAdditionally, rumors circulated at that time that Lewis was gay, and though Lewis denied the rumors, they probably hurt his marketability as well. Lewis' physical appearance at the Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to the reports. \"It doesn't matter what Carl Lewis' sexuality is\", high jumper Dwight Stones said. \"Madison Avenue perceives him as homosexual.\"[38] Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to Lewis before the Olympics, but Lewis and Douglas turned it down, confident that Lewis would be worth more after the Olympics. But Coca-Cola rescinded the offer after the Games. Nike already had Lewis under contract for several years, despite questions about how it affected his amateur status, and he was appearing in Nike television advertisements in print and on billboards. Nike was faced with Lewis's new negative image and dropped him after the Games. \"If you're a male athlete, I think the American public wants you to look macho\", said Don Coleman, a Nike representative.[37] \"They started looking for ways to get rid of me\", Lewis said. \"Everyone there was so scared and so cynical they did not know what to do.\" Lewis and Nike eventually did split, and Lewis signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno. Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the \"Carl bashing\", as he put it, typified by a *Sports Illustrated* article before the Olympics.[37]\n\n\nAt year's end, Lewis was again awarded the top rankings in the 100 m and the long jump and was additionally ranked number one in the 200 m, and for the third year in a row he was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by *Track & Field News*.\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls drafted Lewis in the 1984 NBA draft as the 208th overall pick, although he had played neither high school nor college basketball. Lewis never played in the NBA. A poll on the NBA's website ranked Lewis second to Lusia Harris, the only woman to be drafted by the NBA, as the most unusual pick in the history of the NBA Draft. Ron Weiss, the head West Coast scout of the Bulls, and Ken Passon, the assistant West Coast scout, recommended Lewis because he was the best athlete available.[39] Similarly, Lewis was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys as a wide receiver in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL Draft, even though he did not play football in college. He never played in the NFL either.[40]\n\n\n\n### Ben Johnson and the 1987 World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1984 Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which he would remain undefeated for the next seven years, but others started to challenge his dominance in the 100 m sprint. His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96 s shortly before the 1984 Olympics,[41] but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second.[12] In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95 s. At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly. Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61 m (28 ft 2+3⁄4 in).[9]\n\n\nAt the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Lewis skipped the 200 m to focus on his strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history's second 29 ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan leapt 8.86 m (29 ft 3⁄4 in) at altitude in May, just 4 cm short of Bob Beamon's record.[42] But Emmiyan's best that day was a leap of 8.53 m (27 ft 11+3⁄4 in), second to Lewis' 8.67 m (28 ft 5+1⁄4 in).[43] Lewis cleared 8.60 m (28 ft 2+1⁄2 in) four times. \nIn the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored the gold-medal team to a time of 37.90 s, the third-fastest of all time.[44]\n\n\nThe 100 m final was the most talked about event and caused the most drama. Johnson had run under 10.00 s three times in the year before Rome,[45] while Lewis had not managed to get under the 10.00 s barrier at all. Lewis looked strong in the heats of the 100 m, setting a Championship record in the semi-final while running into a wind with a 10.03 s effort.[46] In the final, however, Johnson won with a time that stunned observers: 9.83 s, a new world record. Lewis, second with 9.93 s, had tied the existing world record, but that was insufficient.[47]\n\n\nWhile Johnson basked in the glory of his achievement, Lewis started to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said \"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs.\" He added, \"I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.\"[48] This was the start of Lewis's calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. His detractors noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Johnson replied \"When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won't complain about that either\".[49]\n\n\n\n### 1988 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nLewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father. When William Lewis died of cancer at age 60, Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100 m in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him. \"Don't worry\", he told his mother. \"I'll get another one.\"[50] Lewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. \"A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father. That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season\", he said, after defeating Johnson in Zürich on August 17.[51]\n\n\nThe 100 m final at the 1988 Summer Olympics was one of the most sensational sports stories of the year and its unexpected outcome would rank as one of the most infamous sports stories of the century.[52] Johnson won in 9.79 s, a new world record, while Lewis set a new American record with 9.92 s. Three days later, Johnson tested positive for steroids, his medal was taken away and Lewis was awarded gold and credited with a new Olympic record.[53]\n\n\nIn the long jump, Robert Emmiyan withdrew from the competition citing an injury, and Lewis's main challengers were rising American long jump star Mike Powell and long-time rival Larry Myricks. Lewis leapt 8.72 m (28 ft 7+1⁄4 in), a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of his competitors could match it. The Americans swept the medals in the event for the first time in 84 years. In the 200 m, Lewis dipped under his Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to Joe DeLoach, who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event he entered, the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.[54]\n\n\nA subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100 m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100 m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the \"true\" world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Zürich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records.[55] From January 1, 1990, Lewis was the world record holder in the 100 m.[56] The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break Lewis's mark.[57] Lewis also permanently lost his ranking as number one for the 200 m in 1988 and for the 100 m in 1989.[30][58] He also lost the top ranking for the long jump in 1990 but was able to regain it in 1992.[9]\n\n\n\n### 1991 World Championships: Lewis' greatest performances[edit]\n\n\nTokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100 m final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart.[12] In what would be the deepest 100 meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents, he reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s.[59] Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he had crossed the line with \"WR\" beside his name on the giant television screens, and the first time he could savor his achievement at the moment it occurred. He could be seen with tears in his eyes afterwards. \"The best race of my life\", Lewis said. \"The best technique, the fastest. And I did it at thirty.\"[36] Lewis's world record would stand for nearly three years.[55] Lewis also anchored the 4 × 100 m relay team to another world record, 37.50 s, the third time that year he had anchored a 4 × 100 m squad to a world record.\n\n\n\n#### Long jump showdown versus Powell[edit]\n\n\nThe 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport.[60] Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. Lewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which he competed. Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls[61] or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt.[62][63]\n\n\nLewis' first jump was 8.68 m (28 ft 5+1⁄2 in), a World Championship record, and a mark bested by only three others beside Lewis all-time. Powell, jumping first, had faltered in the first round, but jumped 8.54 m (28 ft 0 in) to claim second place in the second round.[64] Lewis jumped 8.83 m (28 ft 11+1⁄2 in), a wind-aided leap, in the third round, a mark that would have won all but two long jump competitions in history. Powell responded with a long foul, estimated to be around 8.80 m (28 ft 10+1⁄4 in). Lewis's next jump made history: the first leap ever beyond Bob Beamon's record. The wind gauge indicated the jump was wind-aided, so it could not be considered a record, but it would still count in the competition. 8.91 m (29 ft 2+3⁄4 in) was the greatest leap ever under any condition.[64]\n\n\nIn the next round, Powell responded. His jump was measured as 8.95 m (29 ft 4+1⁄4 in); this time, his jump was not a foul, and with a wind gauge measurement of 0.3 m/s, well within the legal allowable for a record. Powell had not only jumped 4 cm further than Lewis, he had eclipsed the 23-year-old mark set by Bob Beamon and done so at low altitude.[64] Lewis still had two jumps left, although he was now no longer chasing Beamon, but Powell. He leaped 8.87 m (29 ft 1 in), which was a new personal best under legal wind conditions, then a final jump of 8.84 m (29 ft 0 in). He thus lost his first long jump competition in a decade.[65] Powell's 8.95 m (29 ft 4+1⁄4 in) and Lewis's final two jumps still stand as of May 2021 as the top three low altitude jumps ever. The farthest anyone has jumped since under legal conditions is 8.74 m (28 ft 8 in).[66]\n\n\nLewis' reaction to what was one of the greatest competitions ever in the sport was to offer acknowledgment of the achievement of Powell.[64] \"He just did it\", Lewis said of Powell's winning jump. \"It was that close, and it was the best of his life.\"[67] Powell did jump as far or farther on two subsequent occasions, though both were wind-aided jumps at altitude: 8.99 m (29 ft 5+3⁄4 in) in 1992 and 8.95 m (29 ft 4+1⁄4 in) in 1994.[68] Lewis's best subsequent results were two wind-aided leaps at 8.72 m (28 ft 7+1⁄4 in), and an 8.68 m (28 ft 5+1⁄2 in) under legal conditions while in the qualifying rounds at the Barcelona Olympics.[69]\n\n\nIn reference to his efforts at the 1991 World Championships, Lewis said, \"This has been the greatest meet that I've ever had.\"[70] *Track and Field News* was prepared to go even further than that, suggesting that after these Championships, \"It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field.\"[70] Lewis's 1991 outstanding results earned him the ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, an award he shared with gymnastics star Kim Zmeskal.\n\n\n\n### Final years and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis in Washington, D.C. in 1996\nAfter the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Though he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 × 200 m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992,[71] he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100 m or 200 m. In the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track.[72] Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4 × 100 m relay team. At the Games in Barcelona, Lewis jumped 8.67 m (28 ft 5+1⁄4 in) in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell who did a final-round 8.64 m (28 ft 4 in). In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 s, a time which stood for 16 years. He covered the final leg in 8.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg.[73]\n\n\nLewis competed at the 4th World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993, but finished fourth in the 100 m,[74] and did not compete in the long jump. He did, however, earn his first World Championship medal in the 200 m, a bronze with his 19.99 s performance.[75] That medal would prove to be his final Olympic or World Championship medal in a running event. Injuries kept Lewis largely sidelined for the next few years, then he made a comeback for the 1996 season.\n\n\nIn 1996, Lewis qualified for the Olympic team in the long jump for the fifth time, the first time an American man has done so.[76] At the 1996 Olympics, injuries to world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iván Pedroso, affected their performances. Lewis, on the other hand, was in good form. Though he did not match past performances, his third-round leap of 8.50 m (27 ft 10+1⁄2 in) won gold by 0.21 m (8+1⁄4 in) over second-place finisher James Beckford of Jamaica.[77] He became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times,[78] joining Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm and American discus thrower Al Oerter; the three would be joined by American swimmer Michael Phelps in 2016. Lewis's nine gold medals also tie him for second on the list of multiple Olympic gold medalists with Paavo Nurmi, Larisa Latynina, and Mark Spitz behind Phelps.[79]\n\n\nLewis' 8.50 m (27 ft 10+1⁄2 in) jump was also officially declared tied with Larry Myricks for the masters record for the 35–39 age group.[80]\n\n\nControversy struck when, as *Track and Field News* put it, \"Lewis' attitude in the whole relay hoo-hah a few days later served only to take the luster off his final gold.\"[77] After Lewis's unexpected long jump gold, it was noted that he could become the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals if he entered the 4 × 100 m relay team. Any member of the American Olympic men's track and field team could be used, even if they had not qualified for the relay event. Lewis said, \"If they asked me, I'd run it in a second. But they haven't asked me to run it.\" He further suggested on *Larry King Live* that viewers phone the United States Olympic Committee to weigh in on the situation. Lewis had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to exclude Lewis from the team. Olympic team coach Erv Hunt said, \"The basis of their [the relay team's] opinion was 'We want to run, we worked our butts off and we deserve to be here.'\"[77] The American relay team finished second behind Canada.[81]\n\n\nLewis retired from track and field in 1997.\n\n\n\n## Use of stimulants[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to *Sports Illustrated* that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete. Before showing the documents to *Sports Illustrated*, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.[82][83]\n\n\nLewis was among the named athletes and Exum's documents revealed that at the 1988 Olympics trials he had three positive results on a combined test for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. All were and are banned in sport due to their activity as stimulants, though at the time all three were available over-the-counter as dietary supplements or treatments for cold and allergy symptoms. The combined concentrations of these stimulants detected in the three successive tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.[82]\n\n\nLewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain *ma huang*, the Chinese name for *Ephedra sinica*, an ephedrine-bearing plant which was then marketed as a weight loss aid.[82] Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.[84][85]\n\n\nThe highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances.[82][86] According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed in 2003 that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\"[82]\n\n\nFollowing Exum's revelations the IAAF affirmed that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. The federation also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with the athletes' names undisclosed and stated that \"the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as 'negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken\".[87][88]\n\n\n\"Carl did nothing wrong. There was never intent. He was never told 'you violated the rules,'\" said Martin D. Singer, Lewis's lawyer, who also said that Lewis had inadvertently taken the banned stimulants in an over-the-counter herbal remedy.[89] In an April 2003 interview, Lewis agreed that he tested positive three times in 1988 but he was let off as that was the normal practice in those times.[90] \"The only thing I can say is I think it's unfortunate what Wade Exum is trying to do\", said Lewis. \"I don't know what people are trying to make out of nothing because everyone was treated the same, so what are we talking about? I don't get it.\"[91]\n\n\n\n## Achievements and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Azerbaijan stamp honoring Lewis, issued in 1996\n* Lewis is the only man to successfully defend an Olympic long jump title.\n* Outdoors, Lewis jumped 14 of the 20 furthest ancillary jumps of all time.

Among them, he played himself in cameos in *Perfect Strangers*, *Speed Zone*, *Alien Hunter* and *Material Girls*. He made an appearance on *The Weakest Link*. He also played Stu in the made-for-TV movie *Atomic Twister*.\n\n\nIn 2011, Lewis appeared in the short documentary *Challenging Impossibility* which features the feats of strength demonstrated by the late spiritual teacher and peace advocate Sri Chinmoy.[96]\nLewis also appeared in the film *The Last Adam* (2006).\n\n\n\n### Bid for New Jersey State Senate[edit]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2011, Lewis filed petitions to run as a Democrat for New Jersey Senate in the state's 8th legislative district in Burlington County.[97] Two weeks later he was disqualified by Lieutenant Governor and secretary of state, Kim Guadagno, as he did not meet the state's requirement that Senate candidates live in New Jersey for four years.[98] Lewis appealed his decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; the court initially granted his appeal but a few days later the court reversed itself and Lewis withdrew his name.[99][100]\n\n\n\n### Coaching[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2018, Lewis serves as an assistant track coach at his alma mater, the University of Houston.[101]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLewis has a son named Bakim, who is a singer songwriter and lives in Houston, Texas.[102]\n\n\nLewis became a vegan in 1990, during his late twenties, and has credited his outstanding 1991 results in part to his vegan diet.[103] He has said that it is better suited to him because he can eat a larger quantity without affecting his athleticism, and he believes that switching to a vegan diet can lead to improved athletic performance.[104]\n\n\nLewis sang a memorable rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during the 1993 NBA Finals.[105]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of vegans\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* 100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Evans, Hilary; Gjerde, Arild; Heijmans, Jeroen; Mallon, Bill; et al. \"Carl Lewis\". *Olympics at Sports-Reference.com*.

He was the most successful competitor at these Games.[12] This also made him only the third Winter Olympian to win four golds at one Games, and he was also the first biathlete to win more than two gold medals at a single Games. In addition, he had won all three competitions staged at the Olympic test event in Salt Lake City the previous year.[7] He also took a four gold medal haul at the Biathlon World Championships 2005 in Hochfilzen, Austria and at the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.[1] Bjørndalen's 95 biathlon World Cup victories and one cross-country victory is two behind of Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann's record of 98 World Cup victories for a winter sport athlete.[1]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Bjørndalen took three medals from five events, winning two silvers and a bronze.[7] At the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, Bjørndalen became the most successful biathlete in Winter Olympic history by surpassing the previous record of nine career Olympic medals, which he shared with Uschi Disl of Germany. He then anchored Norway to gold in the 4 × 7.5 km relay. This was the second time that Norway had won a title in this event, with the other being at the 2002 Winter Olympics (also anchored by Bjørndalen). With this victory he became the second most decorated Winter Olympian of all time and one of only two athletes to win 11 medals at the Winter Olympics.

This put his career victories at the ski events to five, having won once both in 2003 (pursuit) and in 2004 (sprint).\n\n\n\n### 2006–07 World Cup season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006–07 World Cup season results  \n |\n| --- |\n| No. | World Cup location |  | Individual | Sprint | Pursuit | Mass start | Relay | Mixed relay |\n| 1 | Östersund, Sweden | 1 | 1 | 1 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | 1 | 1 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 3 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | DNS\\* | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 4 | Oberhof, Germany | — | 30 | 5 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 5 | Ruhpolding, Germany | — | 1 | — | 1 | 1 | —\n |\n| 6 | Pokljuka, Slovenia | — | DNS | DNS | DNS | — | —\n |\n| WCH | Antholz-Anterselva, Italy | 32 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 2 | DNS\n |\n| 7 | Lahti, Finland | DNS | DNS | DNS | — | — | —\n |\n| 8 | Oslo, Norway | 4 | — | 1 | 1 | — | —\n |\n| 9 | Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia | — | 48 | 9 | 4 | — | —\n |\n| \\*Two sprints were held in Hochfilzen, Bjoerndalen did not enter either.  *Key:\"—\" denotes discipline not held; DNS—Did not start; WCH—World Championships*[1] |\n\n\nBjørndalen made a perfect start to the season, winning all of the first five races in Östersund and Hochfilzen. In the fifth race of the season, the pursuit race in Hochfilzen, he won with one of his largest margins ever, more than 2 minutes. On 30 December 2006 Bjørndalen took part in the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen in the Veltins Arena. In front of about 51,000 people he won it for fourth time in a row. His partner for second consecutive time was Linda Grubben. They both left their rivals, the Robert family, more than one minute behind.[21]\n\n\nIn Oberhof, coming down from training in the heights, Bjørndalen performed below standard for the season, and finishing only 30th and 5th in the individual competitions.\nIn Ruhpolding he led his teammates to victory in the relay event. He won the two following individual competitions. After competing in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Sapporo 2007, he missed several Biathlon World Cup events; after missing eight competitions altogether Bjørndalen finished second in the overall standings, after German Michael Greis.\n\n\n\n### 2008–09 World Cup season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008–09 World Cup season results  \n |\n| --- |\n| No. | World Cup location |  | Individual | Sprint | Pursuit | Mass start | Relay | Mixed relay |\n| 1 | Östersund, Sweden | 24 | 4 | 2 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2 | Hochfilzen, Austria | — | 12 | 2 | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 3 | Hochfilzen, Austria | 14 | DNS | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 4 | Oberhof, Germany | — | 23 | — | 3 | 3 | —\n |\n| 5 | Ruhpolding, Germany | — | 1 | 1 | — | 1 | —\n |\n| 6 | Antholz-Anterselva, Italy | — | DNS | DNS | 5 | — | —\n |\n| WCH | Pyeongchang, South Korea | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 7 | Vancouver, Canada | 18 | 2 | — | — | DNS | —\n |\n| 8 | Trondheim, Norway | — | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | —\n |\n| 9 | Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia | — | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | —\n |\n| *Key:\"—\" denotes discipline not held; DNS—Did not start; WCH—World Championships*[1] |\n\n\nBjørndalen started off the season suffering from the effects of long-term illness, but still placed second in both of the pursuit events. He missed the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen, focusing on training instead. After the break, he returned with victories in both the sprint and pursuit events in Ruhpolding and a third place in the mass start in Oberhof.\n\n\nAt the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, during the men's 12.5 km pursuit, Bjørndalen with at least 15 other competitors accidentally skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap due to the bad marking. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of skiing beside it, which was the right way. A jury meeting decided to give all these athletes a one-minute time penalty, following a complaint from the Russian team. However, another complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result.[22] Along with Bjørndalen's first ever 20 km individual World Championship title, he won four out of six possible gold medals (10 km sprint, 12.5 km pursuit, 20 km individual and the 4 × 7.5 km relay).\n\n\nAfter the World Championships Bjørndalen came second in the sprint in Vancouver, he took over the world cup overall lead. He followed up with a second place, and two victories at the events in Granåsen, Trondheim (the latter being a mass start where he shot clean). He secured his sixth overall win in the last sprint of the season, in Khanty-Mansiysk where he placed second. In the following event (a pursuit), he was beaten at the finish line by teammate Emil Hegle Svendsen, but won the pursuit cup.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen grew up on a farm in Simostranda, the fourth of five children: one of his siblings is fellow biathlete Dag Bjørndalen. Both brothers were part of the Norwegian team that took the silver medal in the men's relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics.[7]\n\n\nBjørndalen resides in the village of Obertilliach, Austria. He also used to live in Toblach, Italy, with Italian-Belgian biathlete Nathalie Santer. They started dating in 1998 and married on 27 May 2006. On 4 October 2012, they filed for divorce by mutual consent.\n\n\nIn April 2016, along with announcing that he will continue his career until the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Bjørndalen confirmed that he was in a relationship with Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva, and that she was pregnant with the couple's first child.[23] On 7 July 2016, they married in Sjusjøen, Norway.[24] Their daughter Xenia was born on 1 October 2016.[25]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2018 Bjørndalen announced his retirement from biathlon. Bjørndalen ended his Olympic career after being left off Norway's 2018 team for PyeongChang, thus ending a bid for a seventh Winter Games.\n\n\n\n## Endorsement[edit]\n\n\nHis close to one hundred individual World Cup wins makes Ole Bjorndalen the most winning winter sports athlete of all time. He brings the same focused intensity and spirit of victory to the brands and products who sponsor him. Ole Bjorndalen cooperates with big and renowned brands. He has been Certina's loyal ambassador since 2011,[26] InstaForex brand ambassador since 2015.[27] Among sports equipment brands that he promotes are Madshus,[28] Odlo,[29] and Casco.[30]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nOle Einar Bjørndalen won the Aftenposten Gold Medal in 1998. He was named the Norwegian Sportsperson of the Year in 2002 and 2014. For his accomplishments in biathlon and cross-country skiing, Bjørndalen received the Egebergs Ærespris in 2002.

His first podium place in the FIS Cross-Country World Cup came in Kuopio 25 November 2001, where he finished in 2nd place in the 10 km freestyle event. One month later he once again came in 2nd place, this time losing out to Per Elofsson in the 30 km freestyle mass-start event in Ramsau, Austria.\n\n\nOn 18 November 2006 Bjørndalen made history by becoming the first male biathlete to win a FIS Cross-Country World Cup event in the Swedish town Gällivare. Bjørndalen won the 15 km freestyle event.[38] In 2007 his countryman, and fellow biathlete Lars Berger won the 15 km cross-country event at the World Championship in 2007.\nBjørndalen has twice finished on the podium in cross-country world cup relays for Norway: first in Beitostølen in 2003, where his team finished third, and secondly in La Clusaz in France in 2006, where Norway came in 2nd place.[39] In total Bjørndalen has been on the podium 5 times in the Cross-Country World Cup.\n\n\nIn addition, Bjørndalen has won FIS events in cross-country twice. His first win was in 1997 in the 30 kilometre freestyle event in Valdres, Norway, and the second was in the 10 km freestyle event in Beitostølen, Norway in 2006. He has also two 2nd places in a FIS-event: in the 15 km freestyle event in Misurina, Italy in 1998 and in the 10 km freestyle event at Beitostølen in 2004. In addition to this, Bjørndalen has one third place in a FIS event, in the 10 km freestyle at Beitostølen in 2001. Following his two Cross-Country World Cup podium finishes in the 2001–02 season, ahead of the 2002 Winter Olympics he stated that he was hoping to become the first competitor to take Olympic medals in both biathlon and cross-country skiing,[7] however Bjørndalen missed out on a cross-country medal, finishing 5th in the 30 km freestyle cross-country race in Salt Lake City on 9 February 2002.[39] He won Skarverennet in 2006 and 2007, and came in 2nd after Petter Northug in 2008.\n\n\n\n## Other victories[edit]\n\n\nOle Einar Bjørndalen won the Beach Volleyball Championship at Laguna Beach in 2001.[40] Bjørndalen has won the World Team Challenge biathlon exhibition event in Gelsenkirchen (held at the Veltins-Arena, the home ground of football club Schalke 04) in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006.

Shooting[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen is a solid shooter, but is generally outside the top twenty marksmen. Bjørndalen finished the 2005–06 season with a shooting percentage of 84%, hitting 292 out of 345 possible targets, that placed him in 36th position for shooting accuracy. His shooting record for both prone and standing were practically identical, 146/172 in the prone and 146/173 in the standing position. In the individual disciplines, he shot 92% in the individual, 89% in the sprint, 96% in the pursuit, 93% in the mass start and 96% in the relay.\n\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Bjørndalen was the 16th best shot with an 85% success rate, the second best Norwegian behind Egil Gjelland. He hit 331 targets out of a possible 364. His prone like most biathletes was much better than his standing shoot, he hit 169/180 (92%) in the prone and 163/184 (81%) in the standing. He had an average of 88% in the individual, sprint and relay, a 91% hit rate in the mass start but only 79% in the pursuit. During his career in 1999–00 he averaged 82%, in 2000–01 78%, 2001–02 74%, 2002–03 86% and in 2003–04 he hit 80% of the targets, however in those five years his standing shoot was the same or better than his prone shoot. In comparison, his greatest rival Raphaël Poirée averaged 87% in 2004–05 and 86% in 2005–06. Nikolay Kruglov was the best shot in 2004–05 with a 91% success rate, with Ricco Groß in second with 89%, and in 2005 Julien Robert was best with a 93% average and Groß again second with 91%.[1]\n\n\n\n### Shooting statistics[edit]\n\n\nStatistics sourced from the International Biathlon Union.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Shooting\n | 2004–05\n | 2005–06\n | 2006–07\n | 2007–08\n | 2008–09\n | 2009–10\n | 2010–11\n | 2011–12\n | 2012–13\n | 2013–14\n | 2014–15\n | 2015–16\n | 2016–17\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall | 85% | 84% | 84% | 83% | 85% | 83% | 86% | 80%\n |  |  | 85%\n | 84%\n | 85%\n |\n| Prone position | 89% | 84% | 85% | 84% | 85% | 87% | 89% | 85%\n |  |  | 88%\n | 84%\n | 86%\n |\n| Standing position | 81% | 84% | 84% | 82% | 86% | 80% | 83% | 75%\n |  |  | 82%\n | 84%\n | 84%\n |\n\n\nand[45]\n\n\n\n## Cross-country skiing results[edit]\n\n\nAll results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).[2]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Year \n |  Age \n |  15 km \n |  Pursuit \n |  30 km \n |  50 km \n |  Sprint \n |  4 × 10 km  relay \n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | *28* | — | — | 5 | — | — | — |\n\n\n### World Championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Year \n |  Age \n |  15 km  individual \n |  30 km  skiathlon \n |  50 km  mass start \n |  Sprint \n |  4 × 10 km  relay \n |  Team  sprint \n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005 | *31* | 11 | — | — | — | — | — |\n| 2007 | *33* | 13 | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n\n### World Cup[edit]\n\n\n#### Season standings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Season \n |  Age \n | Discipline standings\n | Ski Tour standings\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall\n | Distance\n | Long Distance\n | Sprint\n | NordicOpening\n | Tour deSki\n | World CupFinal\n |\n| 1999 | *25* | 63 | — | 48 | 89 | — | — | —\n |\n| 2002 | *28* | 29 | — | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2003 | *29* | 100 | — | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2004 | *30* | 108 | 69 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2005 | *31* | 64 | 39 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2007 | *33* | 46 | 25 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2008 | *34* | 81 | 49 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n| 2011 | *37* | 153 | 97 | — | — | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n#### Individual podiums[edit]\n\n\n* 1 victory – (1 WC)\n* 3 podiums – (3 WC)\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Season\n | Date\n | Location\n | Race\n | Level\n | Place\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **2001–02** | 25 November 2001 | ![Finland](image) Kuopio, Finland | 10 km Individual F | World Cup | 2nd\n |\n| 2 | 22 December 2001 | ![Austria](image) Ramsau, Austria | 30 km Mass Start F | World Cup | 2nd\n |\n| 3 | **2006–07** | 18 November 2006 | ![Sweden](image) Gällivare, Sweden | 15 km Individual F | World Cup | **1st** |\n\n\n#### Team podiums[edit]\n\n\n* 3 podiums – (3 RL)\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Season\n | Date\n | Location\n | Race\n | Level\n | Place\n | Teammates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **1998–99** | 29 November 1998 | ![Finland](image) Muonio, Finland | 4 × 10 km Relay F | World Cup | 2nd | Skjeldal / Dæhlie / Hetland |\n| 2 | **2003–04** | 23 November 2003 | ![Norway](image) Beitostølen, Norway | 4 × 10 km Relay C/F | World Cup | 3rd | Estil / Bjonviken / Andresen |\n| 3 | **2006–07** | 17 December 2006 | ![France](image) La Clusaz, France | 4 × 10 km Relay C/F | World Cup | 2nd | Hetland / Rønning / Northug |\n\n\n## Equipment[edit]\n\n\nBjørndalen uses Madshus skis, boots and poles.\nHe uses Rottefella NNN bindings.\nHis gloves and base layer are from Odlo, and he uses Casco glasses.[46]\n\n\nDuring the off-season in 2006 Bjørndalen was testing a new ski boot that had a high heel in the Torsby ski tunnel with boot manufacturers Madshus. The theory is that it forces the knee more forward for better position and it incorporates the large gluteal muscles.[47]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of multiple Winter Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* All placings and results are sourced by the International Biathlon Union's searchable results database: \"IBU Datacenter\".

He was called the \"Flying Finn\" or the \"Phantom Finn\", as he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.\n\n\nBorn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals,[3] although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.\n\n\nStruggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.\n\n\nNurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the \"even pace\" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi (second from right) with  \nhis family in 1924\nNurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine.[4] Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively.[5] In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932.[5] The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb.[4] They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day.[6] By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02.[4] Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later.[5] The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room.[4] Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery.[5] Although he stopped running actively,[4] he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku.[7] He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.[7]\n\n\nAt 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to \"have run Finland onto the map of the world\" at the 1912 Summer Olympics.[8] He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later.[6] Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters.[4] In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres.[9] Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics.[4] He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab. H. Ahlberg & Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919.[4] During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions.[4] After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.[4]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1920 Olympic trials\nIn the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand.[9] Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers,[9] despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial.[10] As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice.[4] Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs.[4] Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection.[9] In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (*alikersantti*).[4] On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and went on to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.[8][11]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\n### 1920–1924 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi at the 1924 Summer Olympics\nNurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.[9] He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics.[8] He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute,[12] the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku.[5] Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.[9]\n\n\nBuoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously.[13] Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance.[14] He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless.[13] Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921.[15] In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m.[14] A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile.[14] His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since.[8] Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record.[16] After excelling in mathematics,[17] Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.[5][9]\n\n\nNurmi's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day.[16] On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances.[18] In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster.[18] His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H.

Stallard and Douglas Lowe,[18] still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds.[19] The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m.[18] Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace.[20][21] Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass.[20] The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel.[18] On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.[18]\n\n\nIn the cross country events, the heat of 45 °C (113 °F),[22] caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race.[18] Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers.[18] One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious.[23] Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital.[24][25] Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half.[18] As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward.[26] An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line.[26] After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold.[18][26] Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.[27]\n\n\nIn the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth.[18] Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him.[18][28] After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years.[28] He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.[29]\n\n\n\n### U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi, right, and Joie Ray, left, with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge during Nurmi's 1925 U.S. tour\nIn early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January.[30] His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris.[30] Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances.[30] Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances.[30] He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich.[30][31] Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards.[32] Although he hated losing more than anything,[33] Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich.[31] The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.[34] Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.[35]\n\n\nNurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems.[9] He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively.[9] As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland.[9] In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm,[29] despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide.[36] Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again.[37] In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer.[38] This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m.[32] In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna.[39] Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics.[40] At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances.[41] He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before,[41] the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.[42]\n\n\nAt the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight.[43] Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase.[43] He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot.[43] Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused.[43] In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead.[43] Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver.[43] Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day.[43] Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance.[43] On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record.[43] Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.[43]\n\n\n\n### Move to longer distances[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi checks his stopwatch in 1928\nNurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\"[8] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin.[15] Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945.[44] In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn.[45] He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile.[46][47] Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925,[46] and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him.[48] In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km.[15] In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles.[49][50] He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes.[49] Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\"[51]\n\n\nIn April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation.[52] The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing,[52] but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch,[53] and the Associated Press wrote that \"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\"[52] A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism.[53] Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.[54]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi running his first and only \"Short\" marathon 40.2 km (25.0 mi)at the 1932 Olympic trials in Viipuri\nOn 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25.0 mi) in 2:22:03.8 – on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00,[55] just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes.[56] Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon.[57] Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon.[55] The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon.[58] *The Guardian* reported that \"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\"[23] and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury.[8] Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.[59]\n\n\n\n### 1932 Olympics and later career[edit]\n\n\nLess than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles.[60] Sigfrid Edström, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4.[61] and 7/30/1932.[62] [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edström and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi's ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.][63][64]\nEdström stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case.[60] The AP called this \"one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history\", and wrote that the Games would now be \"like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.\"[65] Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki.[66] Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931.[65] The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be \"unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.\"[67] The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\"[68]\n\n\nOn the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted.[69] Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition.[69] However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially.[69] Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier,[70] Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes.[8] The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote.[71] However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm.[71] Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status,[72] and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden.[73] A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international.[74] After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.[72]\n\n\nNurmi refused to turn professional,[75] and continued running as an amateur in Finland.[8] In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926.[76][77] At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost.[78] The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code.[78] With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite.[78] Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934.[8] Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career.[79] In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.[80]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in his men's clothing store in Helsinki in 1939\nWhile active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods.[81] Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him.[81] Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him.[81] After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.[16] In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden.[82] However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games.[16][83] In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki.[84] It became a popular tourist attraction,[85] and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi.[86] The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction.[84] As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each.[87] Within five years, he was rated a millionaire.[85] His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price.[59] Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.[88]\n\n\nIn February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé Taisto Mäki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause.[8] The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and Mäki.[89] Hoover welcomed the two as \"ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.\"[90] While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar Höckert, had been killed in action.[91] Nurmi left for Finland in late April,[92] and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff.[93] Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (*ylikersantti*) and later to a sergeant first class (*vääpeli*).[93]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi lights the Olympic Flame in 1952\nIn 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.[88] His appearance astonished the spectators, and *Sports Illustrated* wrote that \"his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.\"[94] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower.[59] In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.[95]\n\n\nNurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman,[9] but his interest in running never died.[96] He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War.[97] Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club.[98] In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: \"The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'\"[99] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something.[100] Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala.[96] He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Paavo Nurmi in the early 1970s\nAlthough he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964,[101] Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews.[102] On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer.[103] Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art.[104] He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral.[28] Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: \"People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.\"[59] At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin,[9] Konsta Jylhä's *Vaiennut viulu* (*The Silenced Violin*) was played during the ceremony.[105] Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.[106]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi in a calisthenic pose\nNurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907–1968) from 1932 to 1935.[84] Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, \"[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.\"[107] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a \"self-made\" businessman.[87] Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed \"uneasy\".[87] Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career.[87] As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father's time.[87] In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the \"three Olavis\" (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.[87] Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon \"Vampira\", was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi's niece.[108] However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.[108]\n\n\nNurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924.[109] He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21.[109] Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be \"taciturn\", \"stony-faced\" and \"stubborn\".[9] He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his \"sarcastic sense of humour\" among the small circles he knew.[9] Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak,[110] Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media,[9] stating later on his 75th birthday, \"[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.\"[87] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi \"is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.\"[111] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him *Suuri vaikenija* (The Great Silent One),[112] and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: \"Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer.[38][113] Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: \"Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.\"[38] Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: \"Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.\"[114] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that \"in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.\"[115] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: \"He grabbed ahold of me — he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!\"[116]\n\n\nNurmi's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", the \"King of Runners\" and \"Peerless Paavo\",[8][117][118] while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine.[119] One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi \"a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.\"[120] Phil Cousineau noted that \"his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.\"[120] Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a \"freakish heart\" with a very low pulse rate.[121] During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have \"the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.\"[118]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Wäinö Aaltonen and Paavo Nurmi with Aaltonen's bronze statue of Nurmi in the Ateneum museum in the late 1930s\nNurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km; a record in running.[15][122] He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58.[87] His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s.[15] Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008.[123] Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.[124] *Time* selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996,[125] and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.[126]\n\n\nNurmi introduced the \"even pace\" strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race.[127] He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\"[118] Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\"[128] Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running.[129][130] Peter Lovesey wrote in *The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners* that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\"[81] Cordner Nelson, founder of *Track & Field News*, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man’s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\"[111]\n\n\nNurmi's achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Zátopek chanted \"I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!\" when he trained as a child,[87] and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi's methods.[131] Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died.[115] Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could \"repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.\"[132] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games.[132] Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem *Olympic Laurel* that included a verse on Nurmi.[133] In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse *Nurmi* won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.[133]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi on the ten-mark bill\nA bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925.[134] The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.[134] In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship *Vasa* when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961.[135] Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work *Löpare* (*Runners*) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide.[133] *Boken om Nurmi* (*The Book about Nurmi*), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman.[133] Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939,[136] while Finnair named its first DC-8 *Paavo Nurmi* in 1969.[137] Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.[133]\n\n\nPaavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest.[138] In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957.[139] Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi.[140] A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987.[141] The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively.[141] The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993.[141] In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the *Paavo Nurmi Stadium*.[133] Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m.[142] In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel *Marathon Man* as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi.[143] The opera on Nurmi, *Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.*, written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000.[144] In a 2005 episode of *The Simpsons*, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.[145] The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.[146][147]\n\n\n\n## Career summary (1920–34)[edit]\n\n\n### Seasons[edit]\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)Nurmi beats Wide to a win in Stockholm, July 1926.\n![refer to

He was the most successful competitor at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. This achievement set a record that lasted for 36 years, until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial.[1][2] *Swimming World Magazine* named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was born on February 10, 1950, in Modesto, California, the first of three children[3] of Lenore Sylvia (Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed \"Sklotkovick\", were from Russia.[4][5][6] When Spitz was two years old, his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. \"You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide,\" Lenore Spitz told a reporter for *Time* in 1968.[3] At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored six other Olympic medal winners.\n\n\nAt only 10, Spitz held one world age-group record and 17 national records.[7] When Spitz was 14, his family moved to Santa Clara, where he joined the Santa Clara Swim Club and was trained by coach George F. Haines.[7] From 1964 to 1968, Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance.[*citation needed*] In 1966 at age 16, he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 total AAU titles. The following year, Spitz emerged on the world swimming stage when he set his first world record at a small California meet with a time of 4:10.60 in the 400-meter freestyle.[8]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Maccabiah Games[edit]\n\n\nSpitz swam in his first international competition at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At age 15 and weighing 130 pounds, he won four gold medals in Tel Aviv—the 400 m freestyle, the 1,500 freestyle, the 400 m individual medley, and the 800 m freestyle relay, and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games.[3][9][10]\n\n\nHe returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete, at the 1969 Maccabiah Games. This time, he won six gold medals.[*citation needed*] He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.[11]\n\n\nIn 1985, Spitz lit the torch to open the 1985 Maccabiah Games.[12]\n\n\nIn 2005, he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 2005 Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games, with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.\n\n\n\n### Pan American Games[edit]\n\n\nHe won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira, won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### 1968 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1968 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz c. 1968\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1968 Mexico City |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:31.7\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:52.3\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 56.40\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 53.00\n |\n\n\nSpitz was already the holder of ten world records, and he brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33.[13] In addition, Spitz finished second to fellow American Doug Russell in the 100-meter butterfly. He lost to Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.[14] Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance.\n\n\n\n### College training[edit]\n\n\nSpitz was disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance. in January 1969, he decided to attend Indiana University[2] to train with legendary Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman,[15] who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman \"the biggest decision of my life (and) the best.\"[16] While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972.\n\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Mark the Shark\" by his teammates.\n\n\n\n### 1972 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics and 1972 Summer Olympics\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Spitz at the 1972 Olympics\n |\n| Medal record\n |\n| 1972 Munich |\n| Representing the USA |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 2:00.70 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle relay  | 3:26.42 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:52.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 54.27 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle relay  | 7:35.78 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m freestyle  | 51.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley relay  | 3:48.16 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz was back to repeat his quest for the six gold medals. He did even better, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Furthermore, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Spitz was originally reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing that he would not win the gold medal. Minutes before the race, he confessed on the pool deck to ABC's Donna de Varona, \"I know I say I don't want to swim before every event, but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure.\" Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacket worn by Mark Spitz during the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nSpitz is one of five Olympians to win nine or more career gold medals: Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis also have nine;[18] only Phelps has won more with 23. Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Phelps broke the record at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nAfter he had completed his events, Spitz left Munich early as a result of the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and later murdered by Palestinian terrorists.[19][20] Being Jewish himself, there was concern among the Olympic authorities that Spitz would become a likely target for the Palestinians and he was escorted to London for his own safety.[21][22][23] It is believed that he was escorted out of the country by US Marines stationed in West Germany.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was only 22 years old.[24]\n\n\nAt age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after filmmaker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying.[25] Spitz's comeback attempt made the cover of *Parade* and was also reported on in *Sports Illustrated* and *Esquire*.[26] Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz was two seconds slower than the Olympic standard and failed to qualify.[25]\n\n\nIn 1999, Spitz ranked No. 33 on *ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes*, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.[27]\n\n\n\n## Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\n* International Swimming Hall of Fame, Inducted 1977.[28]\n* International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 1979.[29]\n* United States Olympic Hall of Fame, Inducted 1983.[30]\n* Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Inducted 1990.[31]\n* San Jose Sports Hall of Fame, inducted Wednesday, November 14, 2007.[32][33]\n* National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007.[34]\n* Long Beach City College Hall of Fame, Inducted 2007[35]\n* Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame[36]\n\n\n## Film and television career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz retired from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while he was still a household name due to his athletic success.[37]\n\n\nA poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable.[38]\n\n\nIn Spitz's TV debut, he appeared as himself in a skit as a dentist on a Bob Hope special that aired October 5, 1972. In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* and *The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour*. On the TV drama *Emergency!*, he portrayed Pete Barlow, whose wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy) is accidentally shot by a handgun in an overfull drawer. He also appeared briefly on *The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast* of California Governor Ronald Reagan in September 1973.\n\n\nSpitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[39] In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in *Challenge of a Lifetime*. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure[38] except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.[38]\n\n\n\n### Narration[edit]\n\n\nSpitz narrated *Freedom's Fury*, a 2006 Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's Blood in the Water match against the Soviet Union during the Revolution of 1956—considered among the most famous water polo matches.[40] The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu,[41] and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.[40]\n\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\nHe appeared in an advertisement for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption \"I always drink it--is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers.\"\n\n\nIn 1974, he was in a number of Schick razors commercials.[42] In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation.\n\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS.[43] Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard's first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996 and 2004). The ad was entitled \"Shock\".[44] Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the \"Orbitrek Elite\" fitness workout.[45]\n\n\nIn 2012, Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2019 commercial, Spitz pitched a personal EKG device by KardiaMobile.[46]\n\n\nIn 2022, Spitz endorsed the health supplement Relief Factor.[47]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz and Suzy Weiner on their wedding day in May 1973\n![](image)Spitz (far right) and his wife (far left) with President Gerald Ford and First Lady Betty Ford in 1976\nWhen Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father's business acquaintances.[38][48] Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973,[45] in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel.[42] They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin was a member of the Stanford swim team.[39][49] Spitz and his wife reside in Los Angeles, California.[50][51]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAt Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, Spitz was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. *Time* magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. \"I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there.\"[52] Spitz graduated from Indiana University in 1972.[53][54]\n\n\n\n### Post-swimming career[edit]\n\n\nAfter Spitz's return to the United States following the 1972 Olympics, he landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.[55] \"A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today,\" Spitz said in 2007. \"I did very well, thank you very much.\"[56] Spitz added, \"I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts.\"[57] Spitz went on to start a real estate company.[58]\n\n\nPer his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker.[59] According to one interview, \"Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the 'water business', as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.\"[60]\n\n\nSpitz has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry. He travels the world, delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, *The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion* by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.[61]\n\n\nIn July 2012, he endorsed Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the award went to Tokyo.[62]\n\n\n\n### Hobbies[edit]\n\n\nHis hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.[63]\n\n\n\n### Famous moustache during Olympics[edit]\n\n\nIn an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated \"I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one.\"[52] Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. \"It took a long time to grow,\" he said.[64] It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a \"good-luck piece\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMark Spitz is quoted as saying, \"When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.'\nAccording to a *Sports Illustrated* article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. \"He looked great with it, don't get me wrong,\" explained his wife Suzy, \"but he looks so handsome without it.\"[65]\n\n\nWhen he was asked why he shaved it off he responded \"well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache ... I'm happy [without it].\"[66] He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz stating that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become \"too gray\",\n\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\nAfter retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.[67] \"During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming,\" says Spitz. \"It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening.\"\n\n\nHe has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.[68] \"People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact,\" said Spitz. \"I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down.\" He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.[69]\n\n\n\n## Olympic controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 1972 medal podium incident[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following his victory in the 200-meter freestyle, Spitz carried his shoes and arrived barefoot to obtain his gold medal. He put them down as the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played. After the anthem, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.[7]\n\n\n\n### Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSpitz has said that he felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven-gold-medal record: \"I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. ... I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is.\"[59] Spitz added, \"They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me,\" he said. \"Yes, I am a bit upset about it.\"[70] Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Spitz, throwing first pitch at a baseball game (2008)\nHowever, on August 14, 2008, Spitz appeared on NBC's *Today Show* where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps:\n\n\n\n\n> It's about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I'm very happy for him. I really, truly am ... I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.[72]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, *Today in L.A.*, Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that \"Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever.\"[73]\n\n\nOn August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps's performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was \"epic\". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:\n\n\n\n\n> You know, Bob and Michael, I wondered what I was going to say at this monumental time, when it would happen and who I would say it to, and of course I thought I was going to say it to you for some time now. But, it's the word that comes to mind, \"epic\". What you did tonight was epic, and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are. I never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention, because I watched you at Athens win the race by similar margins, and 18 months ago at the World's by similar margins. And, you know, that is a tribute to your greatness. And now the whole world knows. We are so proud of you Michael here in America, and we are so proud of you and the way that you handle yourself, and you represent such an inspiration to all the youngsters around the world. You know, you weren't born when I did what I did, and I'm sure that I was a part of your inspiration, and I take that as a full compliment. And they say that you judge one's character by the company you keep, and I'm happy to keep company with you. And you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years, and I know that you will wear the crown well. Congratulations, Mike.[74]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2015, Spitz allegedly claimed that he had seen an email from Omega, the official timekeeper, that Phelps had lost the closely contested 100m butterfly final in 2008.[75] He later claimed that his quote had been \"misconstrued\".[76]\n\n\n\n### Views on drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMark Spitz has been consistent in his criticism of the two swimming world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its \"embarrassing\" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.[77]\n\n\nDuring a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying \"They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing.\"[78]\n\n\nIn August 2008, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying \"the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Olympics portal\n\n\n* List of Indiana University (Bloomington) people\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Summer Olympic medalists\n* List of select Jewish swimmers\n* List of top Olympic gold medalists in swimming\n* World record progression 100 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 100 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 200 metres butterfly\n* World record progression 200 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 400 metres freestyle\n* World record progression 4 × 100 metres medley relay\n* World record progression 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame\".

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*née* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montréal.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.[122] His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4×100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and László Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", Čavić said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] Čavić later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic.

It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched László Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  4×100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fiancée Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012–13 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and László Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 × 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4×100 free\n | 4×200 free\n | 4×100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.[293] *im* is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America[293] and through Special Olympics International.[294] The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.[297][298] Phelps stated he hoped to work with his Foundation more after retirement from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[299]\n\n\nIn 2017, Phelps joined the board of Medibio, a company focused on diagnosis of mental health disorders.[300]\n\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[*citation needed*] However, Johnny Weissmuller is reported to have broken 67 official world records.[301]\n\n\nAll but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. As of July 23, 2023[update], he holds world records in two events (indicated in **bold**), after his last standing individual world record in 400m IM was broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Distance\n | Event\n | Time\n | Location\n | Date\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly | 1:54.92\n | Austin, Texas, US\n | March 30, 2001 | [302] |\n| 2\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly (2)\n | 1:54.58\n | Fukuoka, Japan\n | July 24, 2001 | [302] |\n| 3\n | 400 m\n | Individual medley | 4:11.09\n | Ft.
