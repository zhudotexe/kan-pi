It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation, and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by the Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.\n\n\nThe first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands, \"for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions\". From 1901 to 2022, the award has been bestowed on a total of 192 individuals.[2] The 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus, and Alexei I. Ekimov for the discovery and development of quantum dots. As of 2022[update] only eight women had won the prize: Marie Curie, her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie, Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), Ada Yonath (2009), Frances Arnold (2018), Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna (2020), and Carolyn R. Bertozzi (2022).[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nAlfred Nobel stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[4][5] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[6][7] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish *kronor* (US$198 million, €176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[8] Due to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament).[9][10] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.\n\n\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[11][12] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[10][13][14] According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences were to award the Prize in Chemistry.[14]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize\n\nThe committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates in October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. \"The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm is when each Nobel Laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of His Majesty the King of Sweden. The Nobel Laureate receives three things: a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount\" (\"What the Nobel Laureates Receive\"). Later the *Nobel Banquet* is held in Stockholm City Hall.\n\n\nA maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected. The award can be given to a maximum of three recipients per year. It consists of a gold medal, a diploma, and a cash grant.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Nomination and selection[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n![](image)In 1901, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff (1852–1911) received the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nThe Nobel Laureates in chemistry are selected by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In its first stage, several thousand people are asked to nominate candidates. These names are scrutinized and discussed by experts until only the laureates remain. This slow and thorough process, is arguably what gives the prize its importance.\n\n\nForms, which amount to a personal and exclusive invitation, are sent to about three thousand selected individuals to invite them to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. In practice, some nominees do become known. It is also common for publicists to make such a claim – founded or not.\n\n\nThe nominations are screened by committee, and a list is produced of approximately two hundred preliminary candidates. This list is forwarded to selected experts in the field. They remove all but approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations to the appropriate institution.\n\n\nWhile posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can occur if the individual died in the months between the nomination and the decision of the prize committee.\n\n\nThe award in chemistry requires the significance of achievements being recognized is \"tested by time\". In practice it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. As a downside of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a Prize, as the discoverers may have died by the time the impact of their work is realized.\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Chemistry Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[15]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Prize medals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize medal § Physics and Chemistry\n\nThe medal for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry is identical in design to the Nobel Prize in Physics medal.[16][17] The reverse of the physics and chemistry medals depict the Goddess of Nature in the form of Isis as she emerges from clouds holding a cornucopia. The Genius of Science holds the veil which covers Nature's 'cold and austere face'.[17] It was designed by Erik Lindberg and is manufactured by Svenska Medalj in Eskilstuna.[17] It is inscribed \"Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes\" (\"It is beneficial to have improved (human) life through discovered arts\") an adaptation of \"inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes\" from line 663 from book 6 of the *Aeneid* by the Roman poet Virgil.[18] A plate below the figures is inscribed with the name of the recipient. The text \"REG. ACAD. SCIENT. SUEC.\" denoting the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is inscribed on the reverse.[17]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Prize diplomas[edit]\n\n\nNobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it. The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[19]\n\n\n\n### Award money[edit]\n\n\nAt the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the Nobel Foundation. For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million),[20] but in 2012, the amount was 8 million Swedish Krona, or US$1.1 million.[21] If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others.[22][23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## Nobel laureates in chemistry by nationality[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry.\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Laureates[A] |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United States | 79\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 34\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| ![](image) France | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 8\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Israel | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark |\n| ![](image) New Zealand |\n| ![](image) Norway |\n| ![](image) Poland |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Australia |\n| ![](image) Belgium |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| ![](image) Egypt |\n| ![](image) Finland |\n| ![](image) India |\n| ![](image) Italy |\n| ![](image) Mexico |\n| ![](image) Romania |\n| ![](image) Russia |\n| ![](image) Turkey |\n| ![](image) Taiwan |\n| ![](image) Tunisia |\n\n\n## Scope of award[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has drawn criticism from chemists who feel that the prize is more frequently awarded to non-chemists than to chemists.[26] In the 30 years leading up to 2012, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded ten times for work classified as biochemistry or molecular biology, and once to a materials scientist. In the ten years leading up to 2012, only four prizes were awarded for work strictly in chemistry.[26] Commenting on the scope of the award, *The Economist* explained that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is bound by Nobel's bequest, which specifies awards only in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine, and peace. Biology was in its infancy in Nobel's day and no award was established. *The Economist* argued there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics either, another major discipline, and added that Nobel's stipulation of no more than three winners is not readily applicable to modern physics, where progress is typically made through huge collaborations rather than by individuals alone.[27]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995–2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[28]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry\n* Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize\n* List of chemistry awards\n* List of Nobel laureates\n* Nobel laureates by country\n* Priestley Medal\n* Wolf Prize in Chemistry\n* List of female nominees for the Nobel Prize\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n**^** A.

the greatest benefit to Mankind.\" Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a \"person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance.\"\n\n\nAs of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women.[1][3] Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 60 women, and 27 organizations.[4]\n\n\nThe distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:\n\n\n\n* nineteen women have won the

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\nAt least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry.[5] Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Skłodowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\nThere have been eight years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded (1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940–42). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n*

the greatest benefit to Mankind.\" Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a \"person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance.\"\n\n\nAs of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women.[1][3] Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 60 women, and 27 organizations.[4]\n\n\nThe distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:\n\n\n\n* nineteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize (16.3% of 110 awarded);[5]\n* seventeen have won the Nobel Prize in Literature (14.28% of 119 awarded);[6]\n* thirteen have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5.6% of 230 awarded);[7]\n* eight have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (4.1% of 191 awarded);[8]\n* five have won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1.8% of 224 awarded);[9]\n* and three (Elinor Ostrom, Esther Duflo and Claudia Goldin) have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2.17% of 92 awarded).[10]\n\n\nThe first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel.[11][12] Curie is also the first person and the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother–daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes.[11]\n\n\nThe most Nobel Prizes awarded to women in a single year was in 2009, when five women became laureates in four categories.\n\n\nThe most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Claudia Goldin in Economics, Narges Mohammadi for Peace, Anne L'Huillier in Physics and Katalin Karikó in Physiology or Medicine (2023), Annie Ernaux in Literature and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for Chemistry (2022), Maria Ressa for Peace (2021), Louise Glück in Literature, Andrea M. Ghez in Physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in Chemistry (2020), and Esther Duflo in Economics (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Female laureates[edit]\n\n\n* Physiology or Medicine\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Economic Sciences\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Physiology or Medicine** |\n| No.\n | Year\n | Laureate\n | Name\n | Born\n | Died\n | Rationale\n |\n| 1\n | 1947\n | ![](image) | Gerty Radnitz-Cori | 15 August 1896 Prague, ![](image) Austria-Hungary | 26 October 1957 Glendale, Missouri, ![](image) United States | \"\"for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\"[13](shared with Carl Ferdinand Cori and Bernardo Houssay) |\n| 2\n | 1977\n | ![](image) | Rosalyn Yalow | 19 July 1921 New York City, New York, ![](image) United States | 30 May 2011 The Bronx, New York, ![](image) United States | \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\"[14](shared with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally) |\n| 3\n | 1983\n | ![](image) | Barbara McClintock | 16 June 1902 Hartford, Connecticut, ![](image) United States | 2 September 1992 Huntington, New York, ![](image) United States | \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements.\"[15] |\n| 4\n | 1986\n | ![](image) | Rita Levi-Montalcini | 22 April 1909 Turin, ![](image) Italy | 30 December 2012 Rome, ![](image) Italy | \"for their discoveries of growth factors.\"[16](shared with Stanley Cohen) |\n| 5\n | 1988\n | ![](image) | Gertrude Belle Elion | 23 January 1918 New York City, New York, ![](image) United States | 21 February 1999 Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ![](image) United States | \"for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.\"[17](shared with James W.
