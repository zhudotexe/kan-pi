As of 2023[update], 20 Indians have been nominated and 10 have won Oscars including in the scientific and technical category.\n\n\nAt the 30th Academy Awards, Mehboob Khan's 1957 Hindi-language film *Mother India* was India's first submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film category.[1] It was nominated alongside four other films and lost to the Italian film *Nights of Cabiria* (1957) by one vote.[2][3] In 1982, The National Film Development Corporation of India was instrumental in co-producing Richard Attenborough's biographical film *Gandhi*.[4][5] At the 55th Academy Awards, Bhanu Athaiya became the first Indian to win an Academy Award for designing the costumes.[6] Ravi Shankar was nominated for Best Original Score for the same film.[7] As of 2023, three Indian films have been nominated for Best International Feature—*Mother India*, *Salaam Bombay!* (1988) and *Lagaan* (2001).\n\n\nIn 1992, legendary Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray was bestowed with an Honorary Academy Award, becoming the only Indian to date to receive the honour.[8] Resul Pookutty and A. R. Rahman won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing and Best Original Score, respectively, for the 2008 British film *Slumdog Millionaire*. Rahman also won for Best Original Song alongside lyricist Gulzar for the song \"Jai Ho\",[9] becoming the first Indian to date to have won more than one Academy Award. Rahman also holds the record for most nominations for an Indian with five total nominations to date, followed by Ismail Merchant with four nominations (three for Best Picture and once for Live Action Short). \n\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, three different Indian productions received Oscar nominations, with both *RRR* (feature film) and *The Elephant Whisperers (Documentary short film)* winning their respective categories and thus becoming the first Indian full length feature film and first Indian Documentary short film to win the Oscars.[10] Several Indians and Indian Americans have received the Oscars in the technical category like Rahul Thakkar, Cottalango Leon and Vikas Sathaye.\n\n\n\n\n## Honorary awards[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Satyajit Ray.](image)India's Oscar Honorary Academy Award recipient (in 1992) director Satyajit Ray (Born in Kolkata, Bengal, now West Bengal, into a Bengali Hindu Kayastha family of Mymensingh, Bengal, now Bangladesh).\n\n\nHonorary awards\n| Year\n | Recipient\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992(64th) | Satyajit Ray | \"In recognition of his rare mastery of the art of motion pictures, and of his profound humanitarian outlook, which has had an indelible influence on filmmakers and audiences throughout the world.\"\n | [11][12] |\n\n\n## Competitive Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive awards\n| Year\n | Nominee(s)/recipient(s)\n | Film\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958(30th) | *Mother India* | *Mother India* | Best Foreign Language Film | Nominated\n | [2] |\n| 1961(33rd) | Ismail Merchant | *The Creation of Woman* | Best Short Subject (Live Action) | Nominated\n | [13] |\n| 1969(41st) | Fali Bilimoria | *The House That Ananda Built* | Best Documentary (Short Subject) | Nominated\n |  |\n| 1978(50th) | Ishu Patel | *Bead Game* | Best Animated Short Film | Nominated\n | [14] |\n| 1979(51st) | K.

It is the first Indian feature documentary to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[3]\n\n\nProduced under Ghosh and Thomas' Black Ticket Films banner, the film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, where it won two awards, the Audience Award and a Special Jury Award in the World Cinema Documentary category.[4] It received unanimous acclaim from film festivals and critics, winning several international awards and critical acclaim from the press. It was named a \"Critics Pick\" by *The New York Times*,[5] and Jason Rezaian at *The Washington Post* called it \"the most inspiring journalism movie — maybe ever\".[6] In 2023, Writing With Fire won a Peabody Award for Best Documentary Film,[7][8] making Rintu and Sushmit the first Indian filmmakers in the award's 83-year history to win this recognition.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n*Writing with Fire* tells the story of *Khabar Lahariya*, the only news agency in India run by Dalit (oppressed-caste) women. Armed with smartphones, these women journalists report from some of the most difficult regions of the country, risking everything to speak truth to power. Led by Chief Reporter Meera and her feisty understudy, crime reporter Suneeta, the film bears witness to the wit, intelligence and compassion of these journalists in confronting the most urgent stories of our times.\n\n\nSet in the backdrop of an increasingly polarized world, *Writing with Fire* journeys with Meera and her band of sisters for five years - as they break traditions on the frontlines of India's biggest issues and within the confines of their homes, redefining what it truly means to be powerful.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe film has garnered a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"*Writing with Fire* pays stirring tribute to the power of journalism -- and presents a chilling glimpse of the forces aligned against it.\"[9][10] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 83 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[11]\n\n\nJessica Kiang from *Variety* reviewed the film as a \"rousing, inspirational tribute to the pride of grassroots Indian journalism\".[12] Inkoo Kang at *The Hollywood Reporter* called the film \"insightful and inspirational\".[13] while Kate Erbland at IndieWire reviewed it \"profound\".[14] The *Los Angeles Times* called the film \"a vital, stimulating dispatch from the frontlines of consequential citizen journalism\"[15] while the *San Francisco Chronicle*, giving the film a 5-star review, said \"even Woodward and Bernstein would be inspired by the women reporters of India's *Writing with Fire*\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Reception by *Khabar Lahariya* journalists[edit]\n\n\nThe film and its impact was received positively by Kavita Devi, the co-founder of Khabar Lahariya, and various team members who appeared with the film at film festivals and conferences with the filmmakers over 14 months since its world premiere at Sundance.[17] Meera Devi, the main protagonist of Writing With Fire and Managing Editor of the news outlet, described the impact of the film as \"From a global perspective, we have become a lot more popular since the film came out [in Sundance]. Both personally and professionally, it has really amplified the newspaper and its work. We have witnessed a completely different kind of popularity – and that is really good.\"[18] Describing the unique relevance of the film, filmmaker Shabani Hassanwalia, a board member of Khabar Lahariya wrote, \"May this documentary, which follows three KL journalists through a critical phase of Khabar Lahariya’s evolution, be watched far and wide, and may it continue to do what great documentaries are made to do: bear witness to truths that help us see, for the first time.\"[19] Over a year later, once the film was nominated for an Academy Award, the organisation issued a statement criticising the film for presenting a simplified, incomplete profile of their work and \"consuming focus of reporting on one party\", which NPR identified as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's national ruling party. Srishti Mehra, outreach manager at Chambal Media, claimed that this \"misrepresentation\" could negatively affect the security and reputation of *Khabar Lahariya* and its journalists.[20]\n\n\n\n## Theatrical Release[edit]\n\n\nWriting With Fire had its theatrical opening in November 2021 in New York (Film Forum), Los Angeles (Laemmle Royal), Chicago (Gene Siskel Film Center) and Austin (Austin Film Society)- making it the first Indian documentary film to have a US theatrical release. With the overwhelmingly positive critics reviews and audience response to the film’s opening week, screenings expanded to more cities across the US.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFollowing its release, *Writing with Fire* was showcased at numerous film festivals and won several awards, including the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award: Impact for Change and the World Cinema Documentary Competition Audience Award at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.[4] In December 2021, it was announced that the film had entered the shortlist of candidates for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in the 94th Academy Awards in 2022,[23][24] and the next February it was announced that it had been nominated in this category.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | 27 March 2022 | Best Documentary Feature | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh | Nominated\n | [25] |\n| Asia Pacific Screen Awards | 11 November 2021 | Best Documentary Feature Film | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Nominated\n | [26] |\n| Belfast Film Festival | 13 November 2021\n | Maysles Brothers Award for Feature Documentary\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n |  |\n| Bergen International Film Festival | 28 October 2021\n | Checkpoints Award for Best Human Rights Documentary\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [27] |\n| BlackStar Film Festival | 9 August 2021\n | Best Documentary Feature\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [28] |\n| Audience Award – Best Documentary Feature\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n |\n| Cinema Eye Honors | 1 March 2022 | Audience Choice Prize\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Nominated\n | [29] |\n| The Unforgettables\n | Meera Devi\n | Won\n |\n| Cinema for Peace Awards |  | Women's Empowerment\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [30] |\n| Dokufest | 14 August 2021\n | Truth Dox\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [31][32] |\n| Films from the South Festival | 18 November 2021\n | Doc:South Award\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [33] |\n| IDA Documentary Awards | 4 March 2022\n | Best Feature\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Nominated\n | [34][35] |\n| International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam | 26 November 2021\n | NPO IDFA Audience Award\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [36] |\n| Kraków Film Festival | 5 June 2021\n | Silver Horn for Best Film on Social Issues\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [37] |\n| Kyiv International Film Festival \"Molodist\" | 5 June 2021\n | Best Documentary\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [38] |\n| Mountainfilm | 31 May 2021\n | Special Jury Prize – Best Documentary Feature\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n |  |\n| Peabody Awards | 11 June 2023 | Documentary\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [39] |\n| Producers Guild of America Awards | 19 March 2022 | Outstanding Producer of Documentary Motion Pictures | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Nominated\n | [40] |\n| San Francisco International Film Festival | 17 April 2021\n | McBaine Documentary Feature Award\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [41] |\n| Seattle International Film Festival | 18 April 2021\n | Special Jury Prize – Documentary Competition\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [42] |\n| Social Impact Media Awards | 10 February 2022\n | Best Documentary\n | *Writing with Fire* | Nominated\n | [43][44][45] |\n| Best Director\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n |\n| Best Cinematography\n | Sushmit Ghosh and Karan Thapliyal\n | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival | 2 February 2021 | Audience Award: World Cinema Documentary\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n | [4] |\n| World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award: Impact for Change\n | Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh\n | Won\n |\n| Valladolid International Film Festival | 30 October 2021\n | Time of History Award\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [46] |\n| Fundos Award\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n |\n| Wisconsin Film Festival | 20 May 2021\n | Audience Favorite Documentary Feature\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [47][48] |\n| Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival | 14 October 2021\n | Citizens' Prize\n | *Writing with Fire* | Won\n | [49] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Writing with Fire (2021)*\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Director Kartiki Gonsalves stated, \"I met Raghu when he was exactly three months old,\" she added, \"I spent about a year and a half with him when he was a tiny baby before this became a documentary.\" \n\n\nThe team spent nearly five years living the ongoing story of these caregivers and their baby elephant, working in a verite mode of letting the daily life and events of Bomman and Bellie tell the story of a life of an orphaned baby elephant (and his sudden unlikely sister, Amu!).\n\n\nOur intention in the process of documenting the journey of the protagonists was to create a fully immersive experience of the traditional elephant caregiver mahouts of southern India, in a way that honours the lifestyle and traditions of the Kattunayakan people, an ancient tribal community that Bomman and Bellie belong to who have been living with elephants for centuries. \n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Elephant Whisperers Team at the 95th Academy Awards\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes website, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10.[11]\n\n\nRomey Norton of *Ready Steady Cut* rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and said that \"It packs a small punch and is definitely worth the watch, especially if you love elephants.\"[12] Poulomi Das, reviewing for Firstpost, wrote that the \"narrative is fairly straightforward, [and] the storytelling manages to be simultaneously gentle and persuasive.\" Praising the cinematography, Das wrote \"the film is elevated by its stunning cinematography.\" Das opined that \"Much of the beauty of the film lies in the understated coming-of-age of the film’s narrative that draws ample parallels between humans and animals.\" Das said that *The Elephant Whisperers* \"is ultimately a love-story about the power of community,\" and concluded by saying, \"the film champions the dignity of — all kinds of — life.\"[13] Manjeet Singh of Leisure Byte, reviewing the film, praised it, writing, \"the complete documentary appears more like an experience that needs to be felt, than rather just to be seen.\" Singh opined that \"The docufilm is capable of making you cry, or even sob\" and it is \"the finest presentation of the year.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with the media outlet The Hindu, the tribal couple 'Bomman and Bellie' said they were exploited while shooting the 41-minute documentary. They further allege that the filmmakers did not remunerate them or deliver on the promises made, and that the director, who was amiable during the shoot, became distant after the movie won fame. All of these claims have been denied by the filmmaker. [15]\n\n\nBomman subsequently backtracked on his complaint in an video reported by India Today. He stated that he did not know who sent the legal notice nor did he know the advocate, and he did not have any evidence.[16]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | 12 March 2023 | Best Documentary Short Film | Kartiki Gonsalves, Guneet Monga | Won\n | [17][3][18][19] |\n| DOC NYC | 9 November 2022\n | Shorts: Change Makers\n | *The Elephant Whisperers* | Shortlisted\n | [20] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | 16 November 2022 | Score – Short Film (Documentary)\n | Sven Faulconer\n | Nominated\n | [21] |\n| IDA Documentary Awards | 10 December 2022\n | Best Short Documentary\n | *The Elephant Whisperers* | Nominated\n | [22] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Submissions for Best Documentary Short Academy Award\n* Mudumalai National Park\n* Theppakadu Elephant Camp\n* Tamil Nadu Forest Department\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bomman and Bellie also speak this language of the Kattunayakan tribe, which is a mixture of Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil.[1][2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Keswani, Pallavi (27 December 2022). \"'The Elephant Whisperers' documentary review: A strikingly-lush safari on the co-existence of man and nature\". *The Hindu*.

The film follows siblings Mohammad Saud and Nadeem Shehzad, who rescue and treat injured birds in India.[2]\n\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on 22 January 2022, where it won Grand Jury Prize in World Cinema Documentary Competition.[3][4] It also had a screening at Cannes Film Festival in the special screening section,[5] where it won the Golden Eye.[6] It was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\nTwo brothers Saud and Nadeem were raised in New Delhi, looking at a sky speckled with black kites, watching as relatives tossed meat up to these birds of prey. Muslim belief held that feeding the kites would expel troubles. Now, birds are falling from the polluted, opaque skies of New Delhi and the two brothers have made it their life’s work to care for the injured black kites.[9]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nThe documentary is the story of Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud, the two brothers who run a bird clinic in Wazirabad, Delhi where 20,000 raptors have been cured over the last 20 years. Impressed with their dedication and the spirit, Shaunak Sen, the director decided to film them. As he said, \"I am drawn by the subject of the interconnectedness of an ecosystem — one that humans are a part of, not apart from. How man, animals share space and become part of the whole. It is a valuable story.\"[10]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on 22 January 2022.[9][11] It was also selected for screening at 2022 Cannes Film Festival in 'Special Screenings' section and was screened on 23 May.[12][13][14]\n\n\nThe film was released in the United States in fall 2022, along with festival screenings, by Submarine Deluxe, in association with Sideshow.[15]\n\n\nThe film was selected for Documentary Competition in the 46th Hong Kong International Film Festival, where it was screened on 24 August 2022 and won Firebird Award.[16] In September 2022, it was invited to the 18th Zurich Film Festival held from 22 September to 2 October, where it was nominated in documentary competition section.[17] In the same month, it was also selected in main slate of 2022 New York Film Festival held from 30 September – 16 October 2022.[18] It also made it to 'Wide Angle - Documentary Showcase' section of 27th Busan International Film Festival and was screened on 9 October 2022.[19] Next it was selected at BFI London Film Festival held from 5 October to 16 October 2022, where it won The Grierson Award in the Documentary Competition.[20]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nHBO Documentary Films bought the worldwide television rights for the film and following its theatrical run in the United States it became available on HBO and streaming service HBO Max on 7 February 2023.[21]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 99% of 82 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A poetic tribute to tenacity, *All That Breathes* uses two brothers' tireless efforts to make a broader point about finding triumph within tragedy.\"[22] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 87 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[23]\n\n\nDaniel Fienberg of *The Hollywood Reporter*, reviewing the film wrote, \"Sen has encapsulated a vision of New Delhi in which modern life, particularly pollution and overpopulation, have placed new strain on the balance between humans and nature.\" Praising the film he further stated that the film \"is one of the more dreamily provocative documentaries I’ve ever seen.\" Fienberg concluding his review remarked, \"In this tiny marvel of a documentary, it’s a little and a lot all at once\".[24] \nDennis Harvey reviewing for *Variety* praised the score of the film, writing, \"The meditative yet ingratiating impact is furthered by Roger Goula’s score, which strikes aptly spectral notes.\" He also appreciated the cinematography and wrote, \"There’s an inventive lyricism to the imagery here, aesthetically unified despite three credited cinematographers.\" Concluding his review Harvey stated, \"With a tone more melancholic and charming than one might expect given the various crises at play here, Sen's deceptively casual observational documentary prefers dwelling on resistance and resilience to pronouncements of doom.\"[25] Josh Flanders and Sheri Flanders of *Chicago Reader* termed the film, \"A soaring visual masterpiece.\"[26] David Ehrlich of IndieWire graded the film with B+ and praised the framework comparing it with Janusz Kamiński. Ehrlich appreciating the score, sound recording and camerawork wrote, \"Roger Goula’s orgiastic synth score (a little Philip Glass, a lot of Dan Deacon) and Niladri Shekhar Roy and Moinak Bose’s visceral sound recording (brace for an entire chorus of rats) complement the micro-attention of the camerawork by hearing a tumult of life in even the most unassuming frame.\" He concluded, \"There is so much life in *All That Breathes* that you won't be left clamoring for more personality.\"[27]\n\n\nPoulomi Das reviewing for *Firstpost* opined, \"Simply as a record of slow-burning ecological tragedy, Sen crafts All That Breathes like a meditative poem, one that is cut to mindful perfection by editors Charlotte Munch Bengtsen and Vedant Joshi. The structure itself is striking in its unadorned approach. There’s poetry in simplicity to be found here..\" She also appreciated the cinematography of Ben Bernhard, Riju Das, and Saumyananda Sahi. Das stated, \"Sen masterfully reveals the underbelly of the capital, seamlessly merging foreground and background, nature and atmosphere, and the seen and the under-seen. She concluded, \"It’s not everyday that you get to see a narrative so attuned to the craft of filmmaking and the beauty of emotion that it results in a hypnotic viewing experience.\"[28] Tomris Laffly of *Harper's Bazaar* reviewing the film opined, \"Humanity comes in its most selfless in *All That Breathes*, [which adopts] the interconnectedness of nature and mankind as a guiding principle.\" Laffly stated Sen unearths something poetic in the [narrative], celebrating slivers of against-the-odds hope in generous sums.[29] Alissa Wilkinson reviewing the film for Vox stated, \" Shaunak Sen’s lyrical portrait of two men who work to save injured and sick birds in the city. Their quest to find resources for their perpetually underfunded operation winds together with meditations on the nature of the birds, particularly kites, birds of prey that have been forced to adapt to the changing city.\" Wilkinson in conclusion opined that the work two protagonists are doing is a \"metaphor for the huge task that bringing healing to the city’s human residents might be, too.\" Since \"we all breathe the same air.\"[30] Grace Han of Asian Movie Pulse rated the film as 4/5 and praised the cinematography writing \"The camera gazes in awe upon the sheer force of urbanity in the Indian capital – and nature’s ability to adapt accordingly.\" Terming the film as portrait she wrote \"All in all, *All That Breathes* illustrates a portrait of a delicate ecosystem that is dangerously upset.\" Han concluded, \"As the future heads into uncertain territory, *All That Breathes* spells out a plea for balance. She further opined, \"In this life, everything all that breathes is connected: under the skies, through the air, and the Earth upon which we live.\"[31]\nBilge Ebiri reviewing for Spirituality & Health wrote, \"Stunningly filmed, the film [is] as gorgeous as it is ambitious, as stirring as it is terrifying.\" Ending his review Ebiri opined, \"And, given the perilous situation all the creatures depicted in this picture are in, one cannot help but wonder if it’s just a matter of time before we are all similarly threatened.\"[32] Shubhra Gupta of *The Indian Express* covering the Cannes Film Festival, wrote, \"Shaunak Sen’s terrific documentary was as much of a celebration [as Pakistan’s *Joyland*].\"[33]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sundance Film Festival | 30 January 2022 | Grand Jury Prize – Documentary\n | *All That Breathes* | Won\n | [4] |\n| Cannes Film Festival | 28 May 2022 | Golden Eye | Shaunak Sen | Won\n | [34] |\n| Hong Kong International Film Festival | 31 August 2022\n | Firebird Award | *All That Breathes* | Won\n | [35][36] |\n| Zurich Film Festival | 2 October 2022\n | Best International Documentary Film\n | Nominated\n | [17] |\n| London Film Festival | 16 October 2022\n | Grierson Award\n | Won\n | [37] |\n| Montclair Film Festival | 30 October 2022\n | Bruce Sinosky Award for Documentary Feature\n | Nominated\n | [38] |\n| Asia Pacific Screen Awards | 11 November 2022 | Young Cinema Award\n | Won\n | [39] |\n| Critics' Choice Documentary Awards | 13 November 2022 | Best Science/Nature Documentary\n | Nominated\n | [40] |\n| Best Cinematography\n | Benjamin Bernhard and Riju Das\n | Nominated\n |\n| Gotham Awards | 28 November 2022 | Best Documentary | *All That Breathes* | Won\n | [41] |\n| National Board of Review | 8 December 2022 | Top Five Documentaries\n | Won\n | [42] |\n| IDA Documentary Awards | 10 December 2022\n | Best Feature\n | Won\n | [43] |\n| Best Director\n | Shaunak Sen\n | Won\n |\n| Best Cinematography\n | Ben Bernhard, Riju Das, Saumyananda Sahi\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Editing\n | Charlotte Munch Bengtsen, Vedant Joshi\n | Won\n |\n| Washington D.C.

Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It revolves around the fictional versions of two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their friendship, and their fight against the British Raj.\n\n\nRajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.\n\n\nMade on a budget of ₹5.5 billion (US$69 million),[8] *RRR* is one of the most expensive Indian films to date. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed multiple times due to production delays and the COVID pandemic. *RRR* was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With ₹240 crore (US$29 million) worldwide on its first day, *RRR* recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹415 crore (US$50 million).[9] The film grossed ₹1,316 crore (US$160 million) worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film, second highest-grossing Telugu film, highest grossing Telugu film of 2022 and highest grossing Indian film of 2022 worldwide.[5][10]\n\n\n*RRR* received universal praise for its direction, screenwriting, cast performances, cinematography, soundtrack, action sequences and VFX. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the seventh non-English language film ever to make it to the list.[*citation needed*] The song \"Naatu Naatu\" won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category. This made the film[11][12] the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award. The film became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for \"Naatu Naatu\", making it the first Indian (as well as the first Asian) nominee to win the award.[13][14] *RRR* also won the awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Song at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards. At the 69th National Film Awards, the film won 6 awards, including Best Popular Feature Film, Best Music Direction (Keeravani) and Best Male Playback Singer (Kaala Bhairava for \"Komuram Bheemudo\").\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDuring the British Raj in 1920, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, an artistically talented young girl from the Gond tribe. Enraged, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. The Nizamate of Hyderabad gets sympathetic to the Raj and warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer to quell the threat. Raju and his uncle Venkateswarulu attend several pro-independence gatherings where he feigns to support independence.\n\n\nBheem's gullible aide Lachhu believes Raju's ruse, where he attempts to recruit him into Bheem's plot. Before taking Raju to Bheem, Lachhu discovers Raju's identity and flees. Shortly after, Bheem and Raju encounter each other, unaware of their opposing allegiances. While working together to save a boy from a train wreck, they form a friendship, gradually growing close. Raju assists Bheem in courting Scott's niece Jenny, unaware that Bheem's agenda is to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates the room where Malli is held captive and promises to free her. Raju locates Lachhu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu captures and sets a banded krait onto Raju; it attacks him; he then warns him of his imminent death and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.\n\n\nDazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. However, Bheem himself divulges his tribal identity and his mission, unaware of Raju's true identity. At an event to honour Scott, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, creating havoc among the guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly gain the upper hand; however, Raju arrives and they fight briefly but Bheem is forced to give up when Scott threatens to kill Malli. Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet he is guilt-stricken over his actions, recalling his pro-nationalistic background and his alter-ego as a mole within the police; he sought a promotion to gain access to gun shipments to smuggle to his village to fulfill a promise made to his dying revolutionary father Alluri Venkatarama Raju.\n\n\nAt Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, inciting the assembled crowd into rebellion. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally recognises his reckless actions. Determined to save Bheem, Raju persuades Scott to execute Bheem in secrecy, while preparing an ambush to rescue him. However, Scott figures out the scheme. While rescuing Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who freed himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him and escapes with her, leading to Raju's capture. Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. He narrowly avoids being exposed when Raju's fiancée Sita, repels them by claiming there is a smallpox epidemic.\n\n\nUnaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realising his folly, Bheem vows to save him. With Jenny's sympathetic assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine and a spear. Taking the fight to Scott, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. Bheem steals a cache of guns for Raju before the barracks are destroyed. The subsequent explosion kills many soldiers and Catherine. Cornering a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Ram is reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with Jenny and his family. To mark the mission's successful completion, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* N. T.

S. Rajamouli announced two projects after *Baahubali 2: The Conclusion* (2017) with producers D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment and K. L. Narayana. Rajamouli prioritised his work on the former, which was touted to be a social drama film, and which would be followed by Narayana's production with actor Mahesh Babu.[15] In November 2017, Rajamouli shared a picture with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan through his social media handles, hinting their inclusion in the film.[16]\n\n\nThe film was announced in March 2018,[17] with the tentative title *RRR*, an abbreviation for Rajamouli, Ram Charan, and Rama Rao.[18] The tentative title *RRR* was later confirmed to be the film's official title as Rajamouli felt that a universal title across the languages was essential for a film of such scale.[19][20] Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad gave the original story and Rajamouli scripted the film, which he worked on for six months.[21] In September 2018, writer Sai Madhav Burra was signed for the dialogues for the film in the primary language (Telugu),[22] whereas dialogues in other versions were written by Madhan Karky (Tamil),[23] Varadaraj Chikkaballapura (Kannada),[24] Mamkombu Gopalakrishnan (Malayalam),[25] and Riya Mukherjee (Hindi).[26] Rajamouli retained several technicians from his previous projects. The crew consists of M. M. Keeravani as the music director, K. K. Senthil Kumar as the director of photography, A. Sreekar Prasad as the film editor, Sabu Cyril as the production designer, V. Srinivas Mohan handling the visual effects supervision, and Rama Rajamouli as the costume designer.[27] Nick Powell was the stunt director for the film, and handled the choreography for the climax action sequences in the film.[28] Prior to the start of film production, both Rama Rao and Charan had attended a special workshop in mid-November 2018, in order to train physically and intensively for their roles in the film.[29][30]\n\n\n*RRR* is an entirely fictitious story incorporating the lives of two real-life Indian revolutionaries, namely Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively. Charan plays Rama Raju while Rama Rao plays Komaram Bheem. The plot explores their stay in Delhi of the 1920s before they begin the fight for their country.[31] Rajamouli stated that there had been a coincidence between the two Telugu tribal leaders and the events surrounding over them.[32]\n\n\n\n\n> When I read about Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, it was exciting to know that their story is similar. They never met each other. What if they had met? What if they had got inspired by each other? That is what RRR is about. It is completely fictitious. The film is mounted on a very large scale. We had to do a lot of research for it. To know costumes, their dialect, their way of living and that is why it took so much time for us to get this together.\n> \n> — S. S. Rajamouli[33]\n> \n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAlia Bhatt (*top*), Ray Stevenson (*middle*) and Ajay Devgn (*bottom*) made their debut in Telugu cinema (Tollywood) in this film.\n\nIn March 2019, Rajamouli finalised the cast. The film marks the Telugu debut of Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt.[34][35][36] Bhatt was paired opposite Charan in the role of Sita, while Devgn would have an extended cameo.[37] Tamil actor Samuthirakani was roped in to play a crucial role.[36] British actress Daisy Edgar-Jones was signed to be paired opposite Rama Rao,[36] however, she left the project in April 2019 citing personal reasons, which later revealed to be scheduling conflicts to *Normal People*.[38] Olivia Morris was cast as her replacement in November 2019. The same month, Irish actor Ray Stevenson was cast as the lead antagonist Scott, with Alison Doody joining in to play Lady Scott.[39] Chakri, Varun Buddhadev, Spandan Chaturvedi and Twinkle Sharma were the child artists for the film.[40]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Deadline Hollywood*, Rama Rao said that they had carried out major research to portray their characters on screen. He was put on an 18-month training programme to get the right physical appearance.[41] *The Hans India* reported in March 2019 that Devgn will appear in the second half of the film during the flashback episodes.[42] Reports claimed that Keerthy Suresh and Priyamani were approached for a role in the film,[43][44] before Shriya Saran confirmed her role opposite Devgn in June 2020.[45] Rahul Ramakrishna,[46] Chatrapathi Sekhar[47] and Rajeev Kanakala are cast in other supporting roles.[48]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Bhatt was trolled by the netizens following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, where she was accused of nepotism. A few fans also called to replace Bhatt in *RRR*.[49][50] However, Bhatt denied the news of her leaving the film and being replaced by Priyanka Chopra,[51] and joined the sets in December 2020.[52] She learnt to speak Telugu for the film.[53][54]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nSabu Cyril served as the production designer for *RRR*.[27] Prior to starting the first shooting schedule, the team had constructed a set at an aluminium factory located in Hyderabad, for filming an action sequence.[55][56] A manduva house was constructed for the film actors and technicians.[57] The first schedule of the film's shooting was held at the Aluminium factory set for nearly 20 days.[55] In June 2020, it was reported that ₹18 crore (US$2.43 million) was spent for a set replicating an entire village in Gandipet, where the team planned to film the sequences in this location post-COVID-19 lockdown.[58] A set resembling the 20th-century Delhi was recreated at the Ramoji Film City,[52] where the team had undergone an extensive action schedule for 50 days, which involved night shoots.[59] Another huge set was constructed by the art direction crew for a song shoot featuring Charan and Bhatt.[60] The promotional music video for the film titled \"Dosti\" was filmed in July 2021, at a specially constructed set at the Annapurna Studios designed by Sabu Cyril and photographed by Dinesh Krishnan.[61][62][63]\n\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe film's launch event with a *puja* ceremony was held on 11 November 2018, which saw the attendance of noted personalities from the Telugu film industry,[64] including Prabhas and Rana Daggubati, who had worked with Rajamouli in the *Baahubali* franchise.[65][66] Principal photography of the film commenced on 19 November 2018 in Hyderabad at a specially erected set at an Aluminium factory in the location.[55][56] It is the first Indian film to be shot on Arri Alexa LF and Arri Signature Prime lens.[67] Senthil Kumar told *American Cinematographer* that, he \"avoided the use of overt stylization such as extreme color palettes and unrealistic camera moves, in favor of a more classical cinematographic approach\".[68] The filming schedule was completed on 6 December 2018.[69] The team took a brief break before commencing the film's second schedule on 21 January 2019 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.[70] An action sequence consisting of 1000 artists was filmed during February 2019.[71] An extensive schedule was filmed in Vadodara for 10 days in March 2019.[72] Few scenes were also shot at Siddhpur, Gujarat.[68] Another schedule was planned in Pune, Maharashtra, however, it was called off following Charan's injury on the sets.[73] Rama Rao too faced a minor injury on the sets,[74] resulting the team to take a break during the schedule.[75] Ram Charan's introduction scene was reportedly shot for 32 days.[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Araku Valley, where parts of the film were shot, including the opening scenes[77]\nAfter their recovery, an action sequence featuring Charan, Rama Rao and 2000 junior artists was shot, reportedly at a cost more than ₹45 crore (US$5.4 million).[78] Introductory sequences of Rama Rao and Charan costed the production upwards of ₹40 crore (US$4.8 million), a sum considered higher than the total budget of many small Indian films.[79] In August 2019, the production headed to Bulgaria to film the second schedule where the crew shot crucial scenes featuring Rama Rao.[80] The shoot was stalled during October 2019 as Rajamouli had to attend a screening of *Baahubali: The Beginning* (2015) at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[81]\n\n\nIn November 2019, a song featuring Rama Rao and Charan was filmed at the Ramoji Film City.[82] The film's official social media handle tweeted that 70% of the film's shoot had been wrapped as of November.[83] Rama Rao headed to the Modakondamma Temple forest area in the Paderu–Araku road to film for five days in December 2019.[77][84] In January 2020, Charan began a week-long night shoot in the Vikarabad forest region.[84] Ajay Devgn joined the film's shooting schedule on 21 January 2020 and wrapped his portions during February.[85][86] The film was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.[87] After the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana granted permission to resume film shooting during June 2020,[88] a 2-day trial shoot was planned, but it was halted following the spike in COVID-19 cases in Hyderabad.[89] The filming was resumed in early October 2020 following the ease of the COVID-19 lockdown in India,[90] and Rajamouli shot for the promotional teaser for the film, titled \"Ramaraju for Bheem\", during this schedule.[91] Abiding to social restrictions related to the pandemic, the production unit was accommodated in a hotel in Madhapur and were barred from coming into contact with outsiders not belonging to the production.[90]\n\n\nIn late-October, the team canned night shoots for the film and stills were revealed by the official social media handles for the film under the tagline *#RRRDiaries*.[92][93] The action sequences, which took place for 50 days, were completed by the end of November 2020.[59] The production then moved to Mahabaleshwar to film a very brief schedule in early December 2020[94][95] The production then moved to Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad for further filming.[96][97] Alia Bhatt began filming her portions in Hyderabad in December 2020, during which key scenes involving her were shot.[98][96] The filming of the climax scenes began in January 2021.[96] Action director Nick Powell choreographed few climax war-sequences in March 2021.[97] A special song shoot featuring Charan and Bhatt was held during the same month.[60] Though the filming was halted again due to the second wave of COVID-19,[99] it was resumed in June 2021.[100] In June 2021, the makers announced that except for two songs, the filming was completed and Charan and Rama Rao had completed their dubbing work in two languages,[101] and had completed the talkie portions for the film.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Naatu Naatu\" song was filmed at the Mariinskyi Palace in capital Kyiv of Ukraine.\nIn August 2021, the final schedule of the film took place in Ukraine.[103] The song \"Naatu Naatu\" was shot during the schedule at Mariinskyi Palace, Kyiv, which is the ceremonial residential palace of President of Ukraine, filming took place some months before Russia invaded Ukraine.[104][13] Barring a few shots, the entire shoot was completed on 26 August 2021.[105] In an article published in March 2022, by *News18*, it was reported that at least 3000 technicians have worked on *RRR*, while nine co-directors also contributed to the film. It took over 300 days to complete the shooting of the film. About 75 days had been allotted to film the action sequences, and 40 fighters from other countries took part in the film. At least 2500 crew people were also hired from London. Overseas locations including Netherlands was also used for shooting some important sequences.[106]\n\n\n*RRR* began with a budget of between ₹350 crore (US$49.7 million) and ₹400 crore (US$56.8 million) in 2019.[107] However, the budget was overrun by around ₹150 crore (US$18 million) due to the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,[108] with the film's final budget estimated to be ₹550 crore (US$66 million),[109][110] thus making *RRR* the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release.[111] In March 2022, according to the producer's application to the Government of Andhra Pradesh for ticket price hikes, the film's budget was ₹336 crore (US$40 million) excluding the Goods and Services Tax and the remunerations of the director and star cast.[112]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nPost-production of the film began simultaneously with the wrapping-up and continuation of film production. The dubbing process began during April 2020, with Rama Rao and Charan dubbing their portions for the film from their homes, and thus being the first persons to do so.[113][114] Both actors gave voiceovers for each other's introduction teasers.[115][116] In June 2021, the film producers reported that both actors had completed dubbing for the film.[117] On 26 August 2021, after filming was completed, the film entered into an extensive post-production phase.[118] With three years already invested in the film, Rajamouli's decision to spend less time in post-production compared to his other films was due to future commitments, rising production costs, and filming postponements caused by COVID-19 restrictions.[119] The dubbing works were completed by late October 2021.[120] Both Rama Rao and Charan dubbed their lines for four languages, namely Telugu, Hindi, Tamil and Kannada.[121]\n\n\nV. Srinivas Mohan is the visual effects supervisor of the film, along with Framestore and the Moving Picture Company (MPC), the film's principal visual effects studio.[122] Alzahra VFX, NY VFXWaala, Redefine, Knack Studios, Makuta VFX, Digital Domain, Rhythm and Hues Studios, Method Studios, Rodeo FX, Technicolor VFX, Legend3D, The Third Floor, Inc, Clear Angle Studios, Halon Entertainment, 4DMax, and Cinesite, among others, are responsible for some of the other visual effects in the film. In an interview, Mohan discussed the utilisation of pre-visualization, lidar scanning, and light stage technology in the film.[123] Extensive visual effects work took place for more than six months during the post-production process.[21] The finishing work for *RRR* was performed at ANR Sound & Vision at Annapurna Studios, by colorist BVR Shivakumar.[68]\n\n\nThe final copy of the film was ready by late November 2021, and was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) that month.[124] On 9 December 2021, the film received a U/A certificate from the Censor Board, with a finalised runtime of 187 minutes.[125]\n\n\n\n## Themes and influences[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I was interested in the coincidence of these two freedom fighters, both born in Andhra Pradesh and present-day Telangana, at the turn of the 20th century. They left their respective homes, disappeared for three-four years, and then came back to fight against the oppressors. But their modus operandi was the same. They were striking police stations, taking away the guns, arming the people, inspiring the people. Unfortunately, they both died at the hands of the British in the same way. But they never met. I thought: What if we make them meet, create a rift between them, and then make each one inspire the other?\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n — S. S. Rajamouli, on the genesis of the film.[126]\n\nAccording to Rajamouli, *RRR* is about an \"imaginary friendship between two superheroes\".[127] He has said that the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, his home state, also had an impact in the conception of the film. \"I had this thought that Komaram Bheem is from the Telangana region and Alluri Sitarama Raju is from the Andhra region. So, if I can bring those two heroes together, it's my way of saying we are one, we are not separate,\" Rajamouli told *Variety* following the film's release.[128]\n\n\nIn a press meet, Rajamouli revealed that the film is inspired by Quentin Tarantino's *Inglourious Basterds* (2009). After watching it he felt, \"[If] we are making a fictional story, we don't need to stick to historical accuracies.\"[15] He cited, \"*Inglourious Basterds* is one of the biggest inspirations when it comes to my films, specifically *RRR*. I was shell shocked when Hitler dies in the film, and how the film brings it off as a big surprise.\"[129][130] The core idea to make this film came in Rajamouli's mind from *The Motorcycle Diaries* (2004). He said, \"The inspiration for *RRR* came from *The Motorcycle Diaries*. I was fascinated by how a character named Che transforms into a revolutionary called Guevara and have structured the characters of my protagonists around a common point, on similar lines\".[131]\n\n\n\nCountercurrents.org's T. Navin notes, \n\n\n> \"The friendship which develops between Ram and Bheem (as Akhtar) while attempting to rescue a child is one of human brotherhood. People cutting across all religions and regions are shown participating in their common fight against the Britishers. The film builds idea of love between religions, camaraderie of the struggling people and promotes the idea of inclusion.\"[132]\n> \n> \n\n Some viewers in India and the Western world viewed their relationship through a queer lens, arguing that they were a queer coded romantic couple on social media; however, others responded with critical and homophobic comments, claiming that Westerners assigning such readings had misinterpreted Indian culture and male friendships.[133][134] Rajamouli reiterated that it was just a friendship, and how one should be unapologetic about showing men's friendship on screen.[135] American filmmaker Joe Russo similarly found it to be \"a really powerful story about brotherhood\".[136]\n\n\n*RRR* borrows from India's two major Hindu mythological epics — *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata*. The two protagonists of the film, Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who are based on real-life personalities, are also modelled after their namesakes from the Hindu mythology. Rama Raju shares the qualities of the supple and skilled Rama of *Ramayana* while Komaram Bheem is equivalent to the muscular and immovable Bhima of *Mahabharata*. Like Rama Raju and Komaram Bheem, Rama and Bhima never met in mythology. The abduction of Sita, which is the central theme of *Ramayana* plays out in reverse in *RRR,* with Rama Raju being captured following a series of events. Komaram Bheem (who is also modelled after Hanuman), carries a message from Sita, and saves Rama Raju.[137]\n\n\n*The Indian Express*'s Manoj Kumar wrote that unlike other Rajamouli's films, *RRR* addresses worldly matters such as \"racism, shared history of freedom struggle among different communities and the need for interfaith brotherhood.\"[138] An article was published by *The Times of India* in April 2022 writing about how pan-Indian films such as *RRR* are promoting violence. Speaking about the issue, writer V. Vijayendra Prasad told that *RRR* showcased action as per the story and era it takes place in, not violence.[139]\n\n\n\nKaveree Bamzai of *Open* magazine writes this about Bheem's attack on the governor's palace, \n\n\n> \"The animals, ranging from tigers to stags, run riot, tearing the enemy to bits. It is both a metaphor and a statement. A metaphor for the weaponisation of the Earth, a foreshadowing of climate change, and a statement on the tribal way of life in which the human apologises to the beast for taking advantage of it.\"\n> \n> \n\n She noted that the film's layered storytelling emphasising the two conflicting ways in which Ram and Bheem fight for India's freedom is a theme that is appropriate to revisit in the nation's 75th year post-independence. She also notes, \n\n\n> \"The fight against the British is shown to be as plural as the actual freedom struggle was. Bheem, in fact, spends much of the movie disguised as a Muslim mechanic, Akhtar, and is given shelter by a family in Delhi. There is no pandering to the establishment in the movie, a hallmark of most movies emerging out of Bollywood currently.\"[126]\n> \n> \n\n\nKatie Rife of *Polygon* in her review of the film, felt that — betrayal, loyalty and legacy are the major themes of the film. Also, she opined that \"*RRR* is relatively light on music and romance, devoting much of its screen time to visual spectacle, gonzo action, and patriotic zeal. The dynamic between Bheem and Raju has shades of the macho bromance of John Woo's 1980s movies, until the film transforms into a superhero team-up\".[140] *MensXP* in their article praising Rajamouli, opined that strong representation of heroism in the film was one of the key reasons for the film's success.[141]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: RRR (soundtrack)\n\nRajamouli's older cousin and regular collaborator M. M. Keeravani composed the score and the soundtrack of the film.[142] The audio rights of the film were purchased for ₹25 crore (US$3.0 million), by Lahari Music and T-Series, which was a record price for a South Indian album.[143] Lahari Music distributed the soundtrack in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam versions, whereas the Hindi version soundtrack is marketed by T-Series.[144]\n\n\nThe soundtrack consists of seven original songs composed by Keeravani, namely, \"Dosti\" (transl. Friendship), \"Naatu Naatu\" (transl. Dance Dance) \"Janani\" (transl. Mother), \"Komuram Bheemudo\", \"Raamam Raaghavam\", \"Etthara Jenda\", and \"Komma Uyyala\". Lyrics are written by Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry, Chandrabose, Keeravaani, Suddala Ashok Teja, K. Siva Dutta, and Ramajogayya Sastry.[145] \"Naatu Naatu\" won Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards.[146]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Left to right: Rajamouli, Charan, Bhatt, Rama Rao and Danayya at the trailer launch event of the film's Tamil version in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\nThe filmmakers invited fans to enter a naming contest by submitting their suggestions for the title of *RRR* in various languages.[147][148] On 25 March 2020, the titles for *RRR* in various versions were revealed: *Raudraṁ Raṇaṁ Rudhiraṁ* in Telugu,[149] *Rattam Raṇam Rauttiram* in Tamil,[150] *Raudra Raṇa Rudhira* in Kannada, *Rudhiram Raṇam Raudhram* in Malayalam (all of which translate to 'Rage, War, Blood') and *Rise Roar Revolt* in Hindi version.[151]\n\n\nThe official social media handle for the film was launched during the film's announcement.[152][153] During the second wave of COVID-19, the movie crew converted the official handle into a COVID-19 helpline offering information regarding the availability of emergency services in Telugu-speaking states as well as safety tips.[154] In August 2021, the team announced that Rama Rao would manage the official Instagram handle for the film.[155] In October 2021, PVR Cinemas announced that more than 850 of its screens would be re-branded as \"PVRRR\" until the release and run of the film. That same month, Rajamouli and the PVR team unveiled the company's re-branded logo.[156][157] After the song \"Naatu Naatu\" was released in November 2021,[158] the hook step choreographed by Prem Rakshith and performed by Charan and Rama Rao in the music video went viral.[159] Many people have recreated the hook step by recording themselves dancing to the song and posting their videos on social media.[160]\n\n\nOn 22 October 2020, a teaser trailer was released, titled \"Ramaraju for Bheem\", coinciding with Komaram Bheem's 119th birth anniversary.[161] A controversy was sparked over portrayal of Bheem's character.[162][163] In the video, Rama Rao was seen wearing a skull cap, applying kohl on to his eyes and appearing dressed as a Muslim man.[164] Members from the tribal community of Adilabad and a few netizens have opposed this representation of an Adivasi leader from the Gond tribe, as a Muslim man.[165][166] In November 2020, during a by-election campaign at Dubbaka, Bharatiya Janata Party's Telangana president Bandi Sanjay Kumar warned Rajamouli,[167] and threatened that his cadre will vandalise the theatres and his properties, if he intended to hurt the sentiments of Hindus.[168][169] Later, in an interview with *Film Companion*'s Anupama Chopra in July 2021, writer Vijayendra Prasad clarified about the Bheem's appearance in the film, saying, \"He is being [hunted] by the British Raj. So, he is trying to escape the people from British police. So, what is the best camouflage? Simple. He is playing a Muslim boy in that time so that he won't be [caught].\"[170]\n\n\nThe official trailer was initially scheduled to be released on 3 December 2021,[171] but was postponed and released on 8 December 2021 in five languages, including Telugu.[172][173] Trailer launch events were held for the five versions of the film in Mumbai (Hindi),[174] Chennai (Tamil and Malayalam),[175] Bangalore (Kannada)[176] and Hyderabad (Telugu).[177] Reviewing the trailer, *The Times of India* cited it as \"Goosebumps overloaded\".[178] Praising the trailer cut, *The Hindu* stated \"SS Rajamouli promises another epic for the ages\".[179] Praising Rajamouli's work, *Hindustan Times* called it \"an epic theatrical experience\".[180] Roktim Rajpal of *Deccan Herald* noted that the film has universal storyline and also felt that it is a \"perfect multi-starrer\" while comparing it with 1957 epic film *Mayabazar*.[181]\n\n\nOn 19 December 2021, a pre-release event was held at Gurukul Ground near Film City in Mumbai to promote the film's Hindi version.[182] Hosted by Karan Johar, the team invited Salman Khan as the chief guest.[182] The television streaming rights for the event were acquired by Zee Network. It was telecasted on Zee TV, Zee Cinema and Zee Cinemalu on 31 December 2021.[183] The next day, it was made available on YouTube. To promote the film's Tamil version, a pre-release event was held on 27 December 2021 at Chennai Trade Centre, Chennai.[184][185] Udhayanidhi Stalin and Sivakarthikeyan were the chief guests of the event.[186] On 29 December 2021, the team took part in the Malayalam version's pre-release event held at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.[187] Tovino Thomas was the chief guest of the event.[188][189] Soon after, the film's release and promotional activities were postponed.

He further wrote that \"*RRR* is about the movies: the thrill of watching stories told at larger-than-life levels, the joy of watching stars collide, the effort of rendering lavish mythologies at whatever the digital equivalent of 24 frames per second is, the sensation of seeing manufactured movement via gleefully conspicuous special effects bump up against genuine physical effort\". Praising the dance number \"Naatu Naatu\", he stated—\"Seriously, the 'Desi Naach' dance sequence feels like a Gene Kelly number dialled up to superhuman levels\".[331]\n\n\nCalling it a \"dudes rock movie\" Hannah Kinney-Kobre of *Pittsburgh City Paper* compared *RRR* with American English-language films and wrote that \"the politics that power American blockbusters are milquetoast and/or incomprehensible – the only thing that justifies their plots is the studio executive's emphasis on recognizable intellectual property as a way to drive up box office totals. If our system can only produce movies that refuse to make the most of their astronomical budgets, why not look elsewhere? *RRR* is a good place to start\".[332] Richard Brody of *The New Yorker* felt that the film is \"of shortcuts and elisions no less relentless than those of American superhero or superstar vehicles, but Rajamouli is an artist of a distinctive temperament and talent\". On a final note, he further wrote \"The movie's powerful sense of revolutionary virtue and collective purpose yields to nationalistic pride that's danced and sung with uninhibited joy\".[333] *Nashville Scene*'s Jason Shawhan opined that \"*RRR*, in addition to being a historical epic, political drama, action spectacle and bromantic telenovela, is a film that engages with history on its own terms. This isn't a case of Tollywood aiming for Western wallets\".[259] In his review of the film, *The Atlantic*'s David Sims stated: \"*RRR* serves as a reminder of how much modern action usually follows a formula. If wonder is to be consistently found on the big screen, then Hollywood has plenty of new lessons to learn from its best competitor\".[334] Praising the film, American screenwriter C. Robert Cargill called it a \"craziest, most sincere, weirdest blockbuster\".[335][336]\n\n\nPraising the film's direction and action sequences, *The Globe and Mail*'s Aparita Bhandari opined that the officers of the British Raj are shown as caricatures, which does not add depth to the narrative. There is very little character development, or social or historical context. She further wrote \"The female characters barely have a role to play, despite the fact that one of Indian cinema's leading actresses Alia Bhatt plays Raju's fiancée\".[337] *Collider*''s Chase Hutchinson stated—\"An unrelenting ride of a film that makes blockbusters such as *Top Gun: Maverick* look like child's play and leaves whatever is happening in *Jurassic World Dominion* in its dust, S.S. Rajamouli's action musical epic *RRR* is what cinema can only hope to aspire to.\"[338] Calling it \"the craziest movie of the year\", Adam Graham of *The Detroit News* further stated that \"*RRR*'s breakout is significant though, and it's the kind of accessible, crossover success story that brings more eyes to different cultures, styles and voices across the globe. Even its subtext is winning favor: the supercharged bromance at the center of the film has been celebrated by some who see Raju and Bheem as gay superheroes acting out a love affair bubbling just below the surface of all those explosions\".[339] In an article published by *Screen Rant*, Mark Donaldson wrote that \"*RRR*'s portrayal of the racism and oppression of colonialism makes it vital viewing for Western audiences that are interrogating their own countries' troubling colonial pasts\".[340]\n\n\nA critic writing for Israeli newspaper *Haaretz*, praised Rajamouli's screenplay and his vision to make the film. They further compared *RRR* with Hollywood films and opined that it is truly an \"entertaining film\".[341] *Comic Book Resources* cited it as the \"best blockbuster of 2022\" and felt that the film \"gives Western audiences the chance to experience something new, the biggest and *best* of Indian cinema\".[342] In an article published by *The Irish Times*, Donald Clarke stated that *RRR* is \"one of the year's unstoppable cultural phenomena\".[343] Matt Patches of *Polygon* and Wes Greene of *Slant Magazine* named the \"Naatu Naatu\" musical sequence as one of the best movie scenes of 2022.[344][345]\n\n\nRitesh Babu, writing for American publication Vox, called RRR \"incredible action movie with seriously troubling politics.\" He accused the film of casteism as well as claiming the director's is characterised by \"deep casteism\" that \"reinforces a Brahmanical vision of the universe.\"[346] Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, whom Rajamouli is a big fan of, also praised the film, saying \"I couldn't believe my eyes – it was like eye candy...it was extraordinary to look at and experience.\" Rajamouli said in response \"I can almost get up from the chair and do a dance – it means a lot to me.\"[347] Filmmaker Daniel Kwan lauded the film, saying \"While a lot of the blockbusters we're making in the states tend to have self aware, cheeky characters trapped in self-serious filmmaking, *RRR* was all heart-on-its-sleeve sincerity wrapped up in the most ridiculous over the top execution. So much to love.\"[348]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\n*RRR* is estimated to have grossed ₹1,316 crore worldwide.[5][10] During its theatrical run, *RRR* became the third highest-grossing Indian film,[349] the third highest-grossing film in India,[350] the second highest-grossing Telugu film,[351] and the highest-grossing film in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, surpassing Rajamouli's previous film *Baahubali 2* (2017).[352][353] *K.G.F: Chapter 2*, which released three weeks later, surpassed *RRR*'s worldwide and India gross figures,[354][355] which was again retained by *RRR* after several re-release show outside India.[10] As of 28 May 2022[update], *News18 Telugu* estimated that *RRR* grossed over ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) worldwide, with around ₹415 crore (US$50 million) coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[356] *RRR* grossed ₹83.40 crore from Karnataka, ₹77.25 crore from Tamil Nadu, ₹24.25 crore from Kerala, ₹326 crore from the Hindi belt, ₹18.2 crore from the rest of India, and ₹209 crore from the overseas.
