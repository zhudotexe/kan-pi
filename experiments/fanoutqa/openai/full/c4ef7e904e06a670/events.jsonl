The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and genomic instability.[1][2] A minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations.[3] Most cancers are related to environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures.[4] Cancer is generally not contagious in humans, though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria. The term \"environmental\", as used by cancer researchers, refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans.[5] The environment is not limited to the biophysical environment (e.g. exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight), but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors.[6]\n\n\nOver one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75–80% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors.[7][8] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25–30% of cancer deaths), environmental pollutants, diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%).[9] These factors act, at least partly, by altering the function of genes within cells.[10] Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[10] Aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect to consider when evaluating the risk factors for the development of particular cancers. Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n![](image)Multiple colon polyps within the colon of an individual with familial adenomatous polyposis\nAlthough there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.[3] The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (\"sporadic cancers\"). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A cancer syndrome or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.\n\n\nMany of the cancer syndrome cases are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of DNA repair genes, oncogenes and genes involved in the production of blood vessels.[12] Certain inherited mutations in the genes *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[3] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of colon cancer cases.[13] In many cases, genetic testing can be used to identify mutated genes or chromosomes that are passed through generations.\n\n\nGene mutations are classified as *germline* or *somatic* depending on the cell type where they appear (germline cells include the egg and the sperm and somatic cells are those forming the body). The germline mutations are carried through generations and increase the risk of cancer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer syndromes[edit]\n\n\n* Ataxia–telangiectasia\n* Bloom syndrome\n* BRCA1 & BRCA2\n* Fanconi anemia\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n* Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n* Li–Fraumeni syndrome\n* Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome\n* Von Hippel–Lindau disease\n* Werner syndrome\n* Xeroderma pigmentosum\n\n\n## Physical and chemical agents[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carcinogen, Smoking and cancer, and Safety of electronic cigarettes\n\nParticular substances, known as carcinogens, have been linked to specific types of cancer. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.[14] It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.[15] Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.[16] Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers and tobacco smoke, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces.[16] Cancer related to one's occupation is believed to represent between 2–20% of all cases.[17] Most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.[16] Job stress does not appear to be a significant factor at least in lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.[18] Participation in Operation Ranchhand in Vietnam during the Vietnam war, or living near a golf course, or living on a farm would increase the risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma due to exposure to the chemical 2,4-D. When 2,4-D is mixed with another chemical pesticide or herbicide, 2,4-T, at a 50:50 ratio, they are collectively known as Agent Orange.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Share of cancer deaths attributed to tobacco in 2016.[19]\n![](image)The incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking.\nTobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer,[20] and causes 80% of lung cancer.[21] Decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung, larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[22] There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the gallbladder, the adrenal gland, the small intestine, and various childhood cancers.[22] Seven toxicants in cigarette smoke have been identified that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis.[23] The mechanism of action of two of them, acrylonitrile and acrolein, appears to involve oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage.[24][25] The other five toxicants, acetaldehyde, cadmium, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and isoprene act through various mechanisms including direct interaction with DNA. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[26] Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world,[20] and about one in five worldwide.[26] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[27][28] However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the *tobacco epidemic*.[29]\n\n\nElectronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that simulate the feeling of tobacco smoking. Daily long-term use of high voltage (5.0 V) electronic cigarettes may generate formaldehyde-forming chemicals at a greater level than smoking, which was determined to be a lifetime cancer risk of approximately 5 to 15 times greater than smoking.[30] However, the overall safety and long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes is still uncertain.[31]\n\n\n\n### Materials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asbestos body in a cytological slideSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.[32] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[32] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[32] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite).[32] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.[32] Common occupational carcinogens include:[33]\n\n\n* arsenic\n* asbestos\n* benzene\n* beryllium\n* cadmium\n* chromium\n* ethylene oxide\n* nickel\n* Plutonium\n\n\n## Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Alcohol and cancer, Diet and cancer, and Obesity and cancer\n\nMany different lifestyle factors contribute to increasing cancer risk. Together, diet and obesity are related to approximately 30–35% of cancer deaths.[9][34] Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and avoidance of processed meat, red meat, animal fats, and refined carbohydrates.[35] The evidence to support these dietary changes is not definitive.[36]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chronic damage due to alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis (pictured above) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer.Alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen. The World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen.[37] In Western Europe 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol.[38] Worldwide, 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol.[39] In particular, alcohol use has been shown to increase the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach, liver, ovaries, and colon.[40] The main mechanism of cancer development involves increased exposure to acetaldehyde, a carcinogen and breakdown product of ethanol.[41] Acetaldehyde induces DNA interstrand crosslinks, a form of DNA damage. These can be repaired by an inaccurate replication-coupled DNA repair pathway.[42] This repair pathway results in increased mutation frequency and altered mutational spectrum.[42] Other mechanisms have been proposed, including alcohol-related nutritional deficiencies, changes in DNA methylation, and induction of oxidative stress in tissues.[43]\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\nSome specific foods have been linked to specific cancers. Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.[44] This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.[45] Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.[46] A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminate, is associated with liver cancer. Betel nut chewing has been shown to cause oral cancers.[47]\n\n\nThe relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to the frequency of high-salt diets and colon cancer is more common in the United States due to the increased intake of processed and red meats.[48] Immigrant communities tend to develop the cancer risk profile of their new country, often within one to two generations, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer.[51][52] A recent prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholate as well as other specific bile acids and colorectal cancer risk in women.[53]\n\n\n\n### Obesity[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCancers related to obesity[54]\n| Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer | Colorectal cancer |\n| Esophageal adenocarcinoma | Endometrial cancer |\n| Kidney cancer | Esophageal adenocarcinoma |\n| Pancreatic cancer | Gallbladder cancer |\n| Thyroid cancer | Kidney cancer |\n|  | Pancreatic cancer |\n|  | Post-menopausal breast cancer |\n\n\nIn the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.[34] Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.[54] Individuals who underwent bariatric surgery for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.[54]\n\n\nThere is an association between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.[54] Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.[55] The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones (estrogens, androgens and progestogens).[54] Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.[56] Adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage and cancer associated genetic instability.[57]\n\n\nPhysical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on immune system and endocrine system.[34] More than half of the effect from diet is due to overnutrition rather than from eating too little healthy foods.[54]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macroscopic appearance of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.\nSome hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[58] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[59]\n\n\nHormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[58] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[58] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.[58] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[58]\n\n\nOther factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[58] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[58] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.[58] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[58]\n\n\nSome treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.[58] Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the selective estrogen-receptor modulator tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, aromatase inhibitors, now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n## Infection and inflammation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Infectious causes of cancer\n\nWorldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to infectious diseases.[9][60] This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[9] Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.\n\n\n\n### Viruses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.\nViral infection is a major risk factor for cervical and liver cancer.[61] A virus that can cause cancer is called an *oncovirus*. These include human papillomavirus (cervical carcinoma), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias).\n\n\nIn Western developed countries, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common oncoviruses.[62] In the United States, HPV causes most cervical cancers, as well as some cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, throat, tongue and tonsils.[63] Among high-risk HPV viruses, the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins inactivate tumor suppressor genes when infecting cells. In addition, the oncoproteins independently induce genomic instability in normal human cells, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.[64] Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are more than 200 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected individuals.[65] Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or excessive alcohol use, is independently associated with the development of liver cancer, but the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development.[65]\n\n\n\n### Bacteria and parasites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathology of *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs within the lining of the bladder.Certain bacterial infections also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.[66] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* causes cancer may involve chronic inflammation or the direct action of some of the bacteria's virulence factors.[67] Parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include *Schistosoma haematobium* (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, *Opisthorchis viverrini* and *Clonorchis sinensis* (cholangiocarcinoma).[68] Inflammation triggered by the worm's eggs appears to be the cancer-causing mechanism. Certain parasitic infections can also increase the presence of carcinogenic compounds in the body, leading to the development of cancers.[69] Tuberculosis infection, caused by the mycobacterium *M. tuberculosis*, has also been linked with the development of lung cancer.[70]\n\n\n### Inflammation[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that inflammation itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.[71] Chronic inflammation can lead to DNA damage over time and the accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.[72] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing tumor microenvironment.[73] Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers.[13]\n\n\n\n## Radiation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radiation-induced cancer\n\nUp to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation.[9] Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a chromosome, it can break the chromosome, result in an abnormal number of chromosomes, inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause chromosome translocations, or cause other types of chromosome abnormalities.[74] Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes were damaged by the radiation.[74] Three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation: morphological changes to the cell, acquiring cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.[74] Even if the radiation particle does not strike the DNA directly, it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations.[74]\n\n\n\n### Non-ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energy to break chemical bonds. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission, and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.[75][76] However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.[77]\n\n\nHigher-energy radiation, including ultraviolet radiation (present in sunlight), x-rays, and gamma radiation, generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[78] The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[78]\n\n\n\n### Ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging, and radon gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[74] Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[74] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear.[74] Radiation-induced meningiomas are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.[79] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma, are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.[74] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[74]\n\n\nIonizing radiation is also used in some kinds of medical imaging. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. Radiotherapy deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.[80]\n\n\nResidential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[74] Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.[74] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.[74]\n\n\n\n## Rare causes[edit]\n\n\n### Organ transplantation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.\nThe development of donor-derived tumors from organ transplants is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be malignant melanoma, that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.[81] There have also been reports of Kaposi's sarcoma occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.[82]\n\n\n\n### Trauma[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Marjolin's ulcer\n\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[83] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.[83] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.[83] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[83]\n\n\nFrequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[83] Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.[83] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.\n\n\n\n### Maternal-fetal transmission[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of acute leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma and carcinoma from mother to fetus has been observed.[84] Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by MHC incompatibility.[84] In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Basu, Ashis K (23 March 2018). \"DNA Damage, Mutagenesis and Cancer\". *Int.

Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[1] Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body.[1] There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.[1]\n\n\nCancers are often described by the body part that they originated in. However, some body parts contain multiple types of tissue, so for greater precision, cancers are additionally classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells originated from. These types include:\n\n\n\n* *Carcinoma*: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers that occur in older adults. Nearly all cancers developing in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and colon are carcinomas.\n* *Sarcoma*: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside of the bone marrow.\n* *Lymphoma* and *leukemia*: These two classes of cancer arise from immature cells that originate in the bone marrow, and are intended to fully differentiate and mature into normal components of the immune system and the blood, respectively. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, accounting for ~30% of cases.[2] However, far more adults than children develop lymphoma and leukemia.\n* *Germ cell tumor*: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).\n* *Blastoma*: Cancers derived from immature \"precursor\" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are *generally* more common in children (e.g. neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, etc.) than in older adults.\n\n\nCancers are usually named using *-carcinoma*, *-sarcoma* or *-blastoma* as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, the most common cancer of the liver parenchyma (\"hepato-\" = liver), arising from malignant epithelial cells (\"carcinoma\"), would be called a *hepatocarcinoma*, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma. Similarly, a cancer arising from malignant fat cells would be termed a *liposarcoma*. \n\n\nFor some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called *ductal carcinoma of the breast*. \n\n\nBenign tumors (which are not cancers) are usually named using *-oma* as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a *leiomyoma* (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is *fibroid*). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the *-noma* suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.[3][4]\n\n\nSome types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and small-cell carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n## Bone and muscle sarcoma[edit]\n\n\n* Chondrosarcoma\n* Ewing's sarcoma\n* Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of

The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and genomic instability.[1][2] A minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations.[3] Most cancers are related to environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures.[4] Cancer is generally not contagious in humans, though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria. The term \"environmental\", as used by cancer researchers, refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans.[5] The environment is not limited to the biophysical environment (e.g. exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight), but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors.[6]\n\n\nOver one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75–80% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors.[7][8] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25–30% of cancer deaths), environmental pollutants, diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%).[9] These factors act, at least partly, by altering the function of genes within cells.[10] Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[10] Aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect to consider when evaluating the risk factors for the development of particular cancers. Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n![](image)Multiple colon polyps within the colon of an individual with familial adenomatous polyposis\nAlthough there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.[3] The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (\"sporadic cancers\"). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A cancer syndrome or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.\n\n\nMany of the cancer syndrome cases are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of DNA repair genes, oncogenes and genes involved in the production of blood vessels.[12] Certain inherited mutations in the genes *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[3] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of colon cancer cases.[13] In many cases, genetic testing can be used to identify mutated genes or chromosomes that are passed through generations.\n\n\nGene mutations are classified as *germline* or *somatic* depending on the cell type where they appear (germline cells include the egg and the sperm and somatic cells are those forming the body). The germline mutations are carried through generations and increase the risk of cancer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer syndromes[edit]\n\n\n* Ataxia–telangiectasia\n* Bloom syndrome\n* BRCA1 & BRCA2\n* Fanconi anemia\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n* Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n* Li–Fraumeni syndrome\n* Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome\n* Von Hippel–Lindau disease\n* Werner syndrome\n* Xeroderma pigmentosum\n\n\n## Physical and chemical agents[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carcinogen, Smoking and cancer, and Safety of electronic cigarettes\n\nParticular substances, known as carcinogens, have been linked to specific types of cancer. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.[14] It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.[15] Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.[16] Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers and tobacco smoke, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces.[16] Cancer related to one's occupation is believed to represent between 2–20% of all cases.[17] Most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.[16] Job stress does not appear to be a significant factor at least in lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.[18] Participation in Operation Ranchhand in Vietnam during the Vietnam war, or living near a golf course, or living on a farm would increase the risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma due to exposure to the chemical 2,4-D. When 2,4-D is mixed with another chemical pesticide or herbicide, 2,4-T, at a 50:50 ratio, they are collectively known as Agent Orange.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Share of cancer deaths attributed to tobacco in 2016.[19]\n![](image)The incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking.\nTobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer,[20] and causes 80% of lung cancer.[21] Decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung, larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[22] There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the gallbladder, the adrenal gland, the small intestine, and various childhood cancers.[22] Seven toxicants in cigarette smoke have been identified that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis.[23] The mechanism of action of two of them, acrylonitrile and acrolein, appears to involve oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage.[24][25] The other five toxicants, acetaldehyde, cadmium, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and isoprene act through various mechanisms including direct interaction with DNA. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[26] Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world,[20] and about one in five worldwide.[26] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[27][28] However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the *tobacco epidemic*.[29]\n\n\nElectronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that simulate the feeling of tobacco smoking. Daily long-term use of high voltage (5.0 V) electronic cigarettes may generate formaldehyde-forming chemicals at a greater level than smoking, which was determined to be a lifetime cancer risk of approximately 5 to 15 times greater than smoking.[30] However, the overall safety and long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes is still uncertain.[31]\n\n\n\n### Materials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asbestos body in a cytological slideSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.[32] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[32] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[32] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite).[32] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.[32] Common occupational carcinogens include:[33]\n\n\n* arsenic\n* asbestos\n* benzene\n* beryllium\n* cadmium\n* chromium\n* ethylene oxide\n* nickel\n* Plutonium\n\n\n## Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Alcohol and cancer, Diet and cancer, and Obesity and cancer\n\nMany different lifestyle factors contribute to increasing cancer risk. Together, diet and obesity are related to approximately 30–35% of cancer deaths.[9][34] Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and avoidance of processed meat, red meat, animal fats, and refined carbohydrates.[35] The evidence to support these dietary changes is not definitive.[36]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chronic damage due to alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis (pictured above) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer.Alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen. The World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen.[37] In Western Europe 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol.[38] Worldwide, 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol.[39] In particular, alcohol use has been shown to increase the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach, liver, ovaries, and colon.[40] The main mechanism of cancer development involves increased exposure to acetaldehyde, a carcinogen and breakdown product of ethanol.[41] Acetaldehyde induces DNA interstrand crosslinks, a form of DNA damage. These can be repaired by an inaccurate replication-coupled DNA repair pathway.[42] This repair pathway results in increased mutation frequency and altered mutational spectrum.[42] Other mechanisms have been proposed, including alcohol-related nutritional deficiencies, changes in DNA methylation, and induction of oxidative stress in tissues.[43]\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\nSome specific foods have been linked to specific cancers. Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.[44] This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.[45] Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.[46] A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminate, is associated with liver cancer. Betel nut chewing has been shown to cause oral cancers.[47]\n\n\nThe relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to the frequency of high-salt diets and colon cancer is more common in the United States due to the increased intake of processed and red meats.[48] Immigrant communities tend to develop the cancer risk profile of their new country, often within one to two generations, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer.[51][52] A recent prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholate as well as other specific bile acids and colorectal cancer risk in women.[53]\n\n\n\n### Obesity[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCancers related to obesity[54]\n| Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer | Colorectal cancer |\n| Esophageal adenocarcinoma | Endometrial cancer |\n| Kidney cancer | Esophageal adenocarcinoma |\n| Pancreatic cancer | Gallbladder cancer |\n| Thyroid cancer | Kidney cancer |\n|  | Pancreatic cancer |\n|  | Post-menopausal breast cancer |\n\n\nIn the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.[34] Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.[54] Individuals who underwent bariatric surgery for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.[54]\n\n\nThere is an association between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.[54] Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.[55] The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones (estrogens, androgens and progestogens).[54] Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.[56] Adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage and cancer associated genetic instability.[57]\n\n\nPhysical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on immune system and endocrine system.[34] More than half of the effect from diet is due to overnutrition rather than from eating too little healthy foods.[54]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macroscopic appearance of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.\nSome hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[58] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[59]\n\n\nHormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[58] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[58] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.[58] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[58]\n\n\nOther factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[58] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[58] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.[58] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[58]\n\n\nSome treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.[58] Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the selective estrogen-receptor modulator tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, aromatase inhibitors, now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n## Infection and inflammation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Infectious causes of cancer\n\nWorldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to infectious diseases.[9][60] This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[9] Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.\n\n\n\n### Viruses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.\nViral infection is a major risk factor for cervical and liver cancer.[61] A virus that can cause cancer is called an *oncovirus*. These include human papillomavirus (cervical carcinoma), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias).\n\n\nIn Western developed countries, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common oncoviruses.[62] In the United States, HPV causes most cervical cancers, as well as some cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, throat, tongue and tonsils.[63] Among high-risk HPV viruses, the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins inactivate tumor suppressor genes when infecting cells. In addition, the oncoproteins independently induce genomic instability in normal human cells, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.[64] Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are more than 200 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected individuals.[65] Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or excessive alcohol use, is independently associated with the development of liver cancer, but the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development.[65]\n\n\n\n### Bacteria and parasites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathology of *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs within the lining of the bladder.Certain bacterial infections also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.[66] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* causes cancer may involve chronic inflammation or the direct action of some of the bacteria's virulence factors.[67] Parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include *Schistosoma haematobium* (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, *Opisthorchis viverrini* and *Clonorchis sinensis* (cholangiocarcinoma).[68] Inflammation triggered by the worm's eggs appears to be the cancer-causing mechanism. Certain parasitic infections can also increase the presence of carcinogenic compounds in the body, leading to the development of cancers.[69] Tuberculosis infection, caused by the mycobacterium *M. tuberculosis*, has also been linked with the development of lung cancer.[70]\n\n\n### Inflammation[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that inflammation itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.[71] Chronic inflammation can lead to DNA damage over time and the accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.[72] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing tumor microenvironment.[73] Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers.[13]\n\n\n\n## Radiation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radiation-induced cancer\n\nUp to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation.[9] Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a chromosome, it can break the chromosome, result in an abnormal number of chromosomes, inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause chromosome translocations, or cause other types of chromosome abnormalities.[74] Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes were damaged by the radiation.[74] Three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation: morphological changes to the cell, acquiring cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.[74] Even if the radiation particle does not strike the DNA directly, it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations.[74]\n\n\n\n### Non-ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energy to break chemical bonds. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission, and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.[75][76] However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.[77]\n\n\nHigher-energy radiation, including ultraviolet radiation (present in sunlight), x-rays, and gamma radiation, generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[78] The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[78]\n\n\n\n### Ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging, and radon gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[74] Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[74] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear.[74] Radiation-induced meningiomas are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.[79] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma, are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.[74] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[74]\n\n\nIonizing radiation is also used in some kinds of medical imaging. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. Radiotherapy deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.[80]\n\n\nResidential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[74] Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.[74] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.[74]\n\n\n\n## Rare causes[edit]\n\n\n### Organ transplantation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.\nThe development of donor-derived tumors from organ transplants is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be malignant melanoma, that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.[81] There have also been reports of Kaposi's sarcoma occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.[82]\n\n\n\n### Trauma[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Marjolin's ulcer\n\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[83] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.[83] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.[83] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[83]\n\n\nFrequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[83] Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.[83] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.\n\n\n\n### Maternal-fetal transmission[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of acute leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma and carcinoma from mother to fetus has been observed.[84] Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by MHC incompatibility.[84] In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Basu, Ashis K (23 March 2018). \"DNA Damage, Mutagenesis and Cancer\". *Int.

Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[1] Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body.[1] There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.[1]\n\n\nCancers are often described by the body part that they originated in. However, some body parts contain multiple types of tissue, so for greater precision, cancers are additionally classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells originated from. These types include:\n\n\n\n* *Carcinoma*: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers that occur in older adults. Nearly all cancers developing in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and colon are carcinomas.\n* *Sarcoma*: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside of the bone marrow.\n* *Lymphoma* and *leukemia*: These two classes of cancer arise from immature cells that originate in the bone marrow, and are intended to fully differentiate and mature into normal components of the immune system and the blood, respectively. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, accounting for ~30% of cases.[2] However, far more adults than children develop lymphoma and leukemia.\n* *Germ cell tumor*: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).\n* *Blastoma*: Cancers derived from immature \"precursor\" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are *generally* more common in children (e.g. neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, etc.) than in older adults.\n\n\nCancers are usually named using *-carcinoma*, *-sarcoma* or *-blastoma* as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, the most common cancer of the liver parenchyma (\"hepato-\" = liver), arising from malignant epithelial cells (\"carcinoma\"), would be called a *hepatocarcinoma*, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma. Similarly, a cancer arising from malignant fat cells would be termed a *liposarcoma*. \n\n\nFor some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called *ductal carcinoma of the breast*. \n\n\nBenign tumors (which are not cancers) are usually named using *-oma* as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a *leiomyoma* (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is *fibroid*). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the *-noma* suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.[3][4]\n\n\nSome types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and small-cell carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n## Bone and muscle sarcoma[edit]\n\n\n* Chondrosarcoma\n* Ewing's sarcoma\n* Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of

The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and genomic instability.[1][2] A minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations.[3] Most cancers are related to environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures.[4] Cancer is generally not contagious in humans, though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria. The term \"environmental\", as used by cancer researchers, refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans.[5] The environment is not limited to the biophysical environment (e.g. exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight), but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors.[6]\n\n\nOver one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75–80% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors.[7][8] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25–30% of cancer deaths), environmental pollutants, diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%).[9] These factors act, at least partly, by altering the function of genes within cells.[10] Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[10] Aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect to consider when evaluating the risk factors for the development of particular cancers. Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n![](image)Multiple colon polyps within the colon of an individual with familial adenomatous polyposis\nAlthough there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.[3] The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (\"sporadic cancers\"). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A cancer syndrome or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.\n\n\nMany of the cancer syndrome cases are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of DNA repair genes, oncogenes and genes involved in the production of blood vessels.[12] Certain inherited mutations in the genes *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[3] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of colon cancer cases.[13] In many cases, genetic testing can be used to identify mutated genes or chromosomes that are passed through generations.\n\n\nGene mutations are classified as *germline* or *somatic* depending on the cell type where they appear (germline cells include the egg and the sperm and somatic cells are those forming the body). The germline mutations are carried through generations and increase the risk of cancer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer syndromes[edit]\n\n\n* Ataxia–telangiectasia\n* Bloom syndrome\n* BRCA1 & BRCA2\n* Fanconi anemia\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n* Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n* Li–Fraumeni syndrome\n* Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome\n* Von Hippel–Lindau disease\n* Werner syndrome\n* Xeroderma pigmentosum\n\n\n## Physical and chemical agents[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carcinogen, Smoking and cancer, and Safety of electronic cigarettes\n\nParticular substances, known as carcinogens, have been linked to specific types of cancer. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.[14] It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.[15] Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.[16] Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers and tobacco smoke, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces.[16] Cancer related to one's occupation is believed to represent between 2–20% of all cases.[17] Most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.[16] Job stress does not appear to be a significant factor at least in lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.[18] Participation in Operation Ranchhand in Vietnam during the Vietnam war, or living near a golf course, or living on a farm would increase the risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma due to exposure to the chemical 2,4-D. When 2,4-D is mixed with another chemical pesticide or herbicide, 2,4-T, at a 50:50 ratio, they are collectively known as Agent Orange.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Share of cancer deaths attributed to tobacco in 2016.[19]\n![](image)The incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking.\nTobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer,[20] and causes 80% of lung cancer.[21] Decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung, larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[22] There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the gallbladder, the adrenal gland, the small intestine, and various childhood cancers.[22] Seven toxicants in cigarette smoke have been identified that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis.[23] The mechanism of action of two of them, acrylonitrile and acrolein, appears to involve oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage.[24][25] The other five toxicants, acetaldehyde, cadmium, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and isoprene act through various mechanisms including direct interaction with DNA. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[26] Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world,[20] and about one in five worldwide.[26] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[27][28] However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the *tobacco epidemic*.[29]\n\n\nElectronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that simulate the feeling of tobacco smoking. Daily long-term use of high voltage (5.0 V) electronic cigarettes may generate formaldehyde-forming chemicals at a greater level than smoking, which was determined to be a lifetime cancer risk of approximately 5 to 15 times greater than smoking.[30] However, the overall safety and long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes is still uncertain.[31]\n\n\n\n### Materials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asbestos body in a cytological slideSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.[32] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[32] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[32] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite).[32] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.[32] Common occupational carcinogens include:[33]\n\n\n* arsenic\n* asbestos\n* benzene\n* beryllium\n* cadmium\n* chromium\n* ethylene oxide\n* nickel\n* Plutonium\n\n\n## Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Alcohol and cancer, Diet and cancer, and Obesity and cancer\n\nMany different lifestyle factors contribute to increasing cancer risk. Together, diet and obesity are related to approximately 30–35% of cancer deaths.[9][34] Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and avoidance of processed meat, red meat, animal fats, and refined carbohydrates.[35] The evidence to support these dietary changes is not definitive.[36]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chronic damage due to alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis (pictured above) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer.Alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen. The World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen.[37] In Western Europe 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol.[38] Worldwide, 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol.[39] In particular, alcohol use has been shown to increase the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach, liver, ovaries, and colon.[40] The main mechanism of cancer development involves increased exposure to acetaldehyde, a carcinogen and breakdown product of ethanol.[41] Acetaldehyde induces DNA interstrand crosslinks, a form of DNA damage. These can be repaired by an inaccurate replication-coupled DNA repair pathway.[42] This repair pathway results in increased mutation frequency and altered mutational spectrum.[42] Other mechanisms have been proposed, including alcohol-related nutritional deficiencies, changes in DNA methylation, and induction of oxidative stress in tissues.[43]\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\nSome specific foods have been linked to specific cancers. Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.[44] This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.[45] Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.[46] A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminate, is associated with liver cancer. Betel nut chewing has been shown to cause oral cancers.[47]\n\n\nThe relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to the frequency of high-salt diets and colon cancer is more common in the United States due to the increased intake of processed and red meats.[48] Immigrant communities tend to develop the cancer risk profile of their new country, often within one to two generations, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer.[51][52] A recent prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholate as well as other specific bile acids and colorectal cancer risk in women.[53]\n\n\n\n### Obesity[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCancers related to obesity[54]\n| Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer | Colorectal cancer |\n| Esophageal adenocarcinoma | Endometrial cancer |\n| Kidney cancer | Esophageal adenocarcinoma |\n| Pancreatic cancer | Gallbladder cancer |\n| Thyroid cancer | Kidney cancer |\n|  | Pancreatic cancer |\n|  | Post-menopausal breast cancer |\n\n\nIn the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.[34] Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.[54] Individuals who underwent bariatric surgery for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.[54]\n\n\nThere is an association between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.[54] Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.[55] The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones (estrogens, androgens and progestogens).[54] Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.[56] Adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage and cancer associated genetic instability.[57]\n\n\nPhysical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on immune system and endocrine system.[34] More than half of the effect from diet is due to overnutrition rather than from eating too little healthy foods.[54]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macroscopic appearance of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.\nSome hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[58] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[59]\n\n\nHormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[58] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[58] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.[58] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[58]\n\n\nOther factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[58] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[58] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.[58] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[58]\n\n\nSome treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.[58] Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the selective estrogen-receptor modulator tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, aromatase inhibitors, now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n## Infection and inflammation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Infectious causes of cancer\n\nWorldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to infectious diseases.[9][60] This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[9] Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.\n\n\n\n### Viruses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.\nViral infection is a major risk factor for cervical and liver cancer.[61] A virus that can cause cancer is called an *oncovirus*. These include human papillomavirus (cervical carcinoma), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias).\n\n\nIn Western developed countries, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common oncoviruses.[62] In the United States, HPV causes most cervical cancers, as well as some cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, throat, tongue and tonsils.[63] Among high-risk HPV viruses, the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins inactivate tumor suppressor genes when infecting cells. In addition, the oncoproteins independently induce genomic instability in normal human cells, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.[64] Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are more than 200 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected individuals.[65] Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or excessive alcohol use, is independently associated with the development of liver cancer, but the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development.[65]\n\n\n\n### Bacteria and parasites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathology of *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs within the lining of the bladder.Certain bacterial infections also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.[66] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* causes cancer may involve chronic inflammation or the direct action of some of the bacteria's virulence factors.[67] Parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include *Schistosoma haematobium* (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, *Opisthorchis viverrini* and *Clonorchis sinensis* (cholangiocarcinoma).[68] Inflammation triggered by the worm's eggs appears to be the cancer-causing mechanism. Certain parasitic infections can also increase the presence of carcinogenic compounds in the body, leading to the development of cancers.[69] Tuberculosis infection, caused by the mycobacterium *M. tuberculosis*, has also been linked with the development of lung cancer.[70]\n\n\n### Inflammation[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that inflammation itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.[71] Chronic inflammation can lead to DNA damage over time and the accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.[72] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing tumor microenvironment.[73] Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers.[13]\n\n\n\n## Radiation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radiation-induced cancer\n\nUp to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation.[9] Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a chromosome, it can break the chromosome, result in an abnormal number of chromosomes, inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause chromosome translocations, or cause other types of chromosome abnormalities.[74] Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes were damaged by the radiation.[74] Three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation: morphological changes to the cell, acquiring cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.[74] Even if the radiation particle does not strike the DNA directly, it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations.[74]\n\n\n\n### Non-ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energy to break chemical bonds. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission, and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.[75][76] However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.[77]\n\n\nHigher-energy radiation, including ultraviolet radiation (present in sunlight), x-rays, and gamma radiation, generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[78] The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[78]\n\n\n\n### Ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging, and radon gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[74] Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[74] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear.[74] Radiation-induced meningiomas are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.[79] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma, are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.[74] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[74]\n\n\nIonizing radiation is also used in some kinds of medical imaging. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. Radiotherapy deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.[80]\n\n\nResidential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[74] Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.[74] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.[74]\n\n\n\n## Rare causes[edit]\n\n\n### Organ transplantation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.\nThe development of donor-derived tumors from organ transplants is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be malignant melanoma, that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.[81] There have also been reports of Kaposi's sarcoma occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.[82]\n\n\n\n### Trauma[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Marjolin's ulcer\n\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[83] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.[83] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.[83] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[83]\n\n\nFrequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[83] Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.[83] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.\n\n\n\n### Maternal-fetal transmission[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of acute leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma and carcinoma from mother to fetus has been observed.[84] Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by MHC incompatibility.[84] In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Basu, Ashis K (23 March 2018). \"DNA Damage, Mutagenesis and Cancer\". *Int.

Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[1] Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body.[1] There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.[1]\n\n\nCancers are often described by the body part that they originated in. However, some body parts contain multiple types of tissue, so for greater precision, cancers are additionally classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells originated from. These types include:\n\n\n\n* *Carcinoma*: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers that occur in older adults. Nearly all cancers developing in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and colon are carcinomas.\n* *Sarcoma*: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside of the bone marrow.\n* *Lymphoma* and *leukemia*: These two classes of cancer arise from immature cells that originate in the bone marrow, and are intended to fully differentiate and mature into normal components of the immune system and the blood, respectively. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, accounting for ~30% of cases.[2] However, far more adults than children develop lymphoma and leukemia.\n* *Germ cell tumor*: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).\n* *Blastoma*: Cancers derived from immature \"precursor\" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are *generally* more common in children (e.g. neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, etc.) than in older adults.\n\n\nCancers are usually named using *-carcinoma*, *-sarcoma* or *-blastoma* as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, the most common cancer of the liver parenchyma (\"hepato-\" = liver), arising from malignant epithelial cells (\"carcinoma\"), would be called a *hepatocarcinoma*, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma. Similarly, a cancer arising from malignant fat cells would be termed a *liposarcoma*. \n\n\nFor some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called *ductal carcinoma of the breast*. \n\n\nBenign tumors (which are not cancers) are usually named using *-oma* as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a *leiomyoma* (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is *fibroid*). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the *-noma* suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.[3][4]\n\n\nSome types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and small-cell carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n## Bone and muscle sarcoma[edit]\n\n\n* Chondrosarcoma\n* Ewing's sarcoma\n* Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of

The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and genomic instability.[1][2] A minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations.[3] Most cancers are related to environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures.[4] Cancer is generally not contagious in humans, though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria. The term \"environmental\", as used by cancer researchers, refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans.[5] The environment is not limited to the biophysical environment (e.g. exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight), but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors.[6]\n\n\nOver one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75–80% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors.[7][8] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25–30% of cancer deaths), environmental pollutants, diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%).[9] These factors act, at least partly, by altering the function of genes within cells.[10] Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[10] Aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect to consider when evaluating the risk factors for the development of particular cancers. Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n![](image)Multiple colon polyps within the colon of an individual with familial adenomatous polyposis\nAlthough there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.[3] The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (\"sporadic cancers\"). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A cancer syndrome or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.\n\n\nMany of the cancer syndrome cases are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of DNA repair genes, oncogenes and genes involved in the production of blood vessels.[12] Certain inherited mutations in the genes *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[3] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of colon cancer cases.[13] In many cases, genetic testing can be used to identify mutated genes or chromosomes that are passed through generations.\n\n\nGene mutations are classified as *germline* or *somatic* depending on the cell type where they appear (germline cells include the egg and the sperm and somatic cells are those forming the body). The germline mutations are carried through generations and increase the risk of cancer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer syndromes[edit]\n\n\n* Ataxia–telangiectasia\n* Bloom syndrome\n* BRCA1 & BRCA2\n* Fanconi anemia\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n* Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n* Li–Fraumeni syndrome\n* Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome\n* Von Hippel–Lindau disease\n* Werner syndrome\n* Xeroderma pigmentosum\n\n\n## Physical and chemical agents[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carcinogen, Smoking and cancer, and Safety of electronic cigarettes\n\nParticular substances, known as carcinogens, have been linked to specific types of cancer. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.[14] It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.[15] Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.[16] Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers and tobacco smoke, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces.[16] Cancer related to one's occupation is believed to represent between 2–20% of all cases.[17] Most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.[16] Job stress does not appear to be a significant factor at least in lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.[18] Participation in Operation Ranchhand in Vietnam during the Vietnam war, or living near a golf course, or living on a farm would increase the risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma due to exposure to the chemical 2,4-D. When 2,4-D is mixed with another chemical pesticide or herbicide, 2,4-T, at a 50:50 ratio, they are collectively known as Agent Orange.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Share of cancer deaths attributed to tobacco in 2016.[19]\n![](image)The incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking.\nTobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer,[20] and causes 80% of lung cancer.[21] Decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung, larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[22] There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the gallbladder, the adrenal gland, the small intestine, and various childhood cancers.[22] Seven toxicants in cigarette smoke have been identified that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis.[23] The mechanism of action of two of them, acrylonitrile and acrolein, appears to involve oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage.[24][25] The other five toxicants, acetaldehyde, cadmium, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and isoprene act through various mechanisms including direct interaction with DNA. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[26] Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world,[20] and about one in five worldwide.[26] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[27][28] However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the *tobacco epidemic*.[29]\n\n\nElectronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that simulate the feeling of tobacco smoking. Daily long-term use of high voltage (5.0 V) electronic cigarettes may generate formaldehyde-forming chemicals at a greater level than smoking, which was determined to be a lifetime cancer risk of approximately 5 to 15 times greater than smoking.[30] However, the overall safety and long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes is still uncertain.[31]\n\n\n\n### Materials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asbestos body in a cytological slideSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.[32] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[32] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[32] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite).[32] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.[32] Common occupational carcinogens include:[33]\n\n\n* arsenic\n* asbestos\n* benzene\n* beryllium\n* cadmium\n* chromium\n* ethylene oxide\n* nickel\n* Plutonium\n\n\n## Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Alcohol and cancer, Diet and cancer, and Obesity and cancer\n\nMany different lifestyle factors contribute to increasing cancer risk. Together, diet and obesity are related to approximately 30–35% of cancer deaths.[9][34] Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and avoidance of processed meat, red meat, animal fats, and refined carbohydrates.[35] The evidence to support these dietary changes is not definitive.[36]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chronic damage due to alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis (pictured above) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer.Alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen. The World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen.[37] In Western Europe 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol.[38] Worldwide, 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol.[39] In particular, alcohol use has been shown to increase the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach, liver, ovaries, and colon.[40] The main mechanism of cancer development involves increased exposure to acetaldehyde, a carcinogen and breakdown product of ethanol.[41] Acetaldehyde induces DNA interstrand crosslinks, a form of DNA damage. These can be repaired by an inaccurate replication-coupled DNA repair pathway.[42] This repair pathway results in increased mutation frequency and altered mutational spectrum.[42] Other mechanisms have been proposed, including alcohol-related nutritional deficiencies, changes in DNA methylation, and induction of oxidative stress in tissues.[43]\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\nSome specific foods have been linked to specific cancers. Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.[44] This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.[45] Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.[46] A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminate, is associated with liver cancer. Betel nut chewing has been shown to cause oral cancers.[47]\n\n\nThe relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to the frequency of high-salt diets and colon cancer is more common in the United States due to the increased intake of processed and red meats.[48] Immigrant communities tend to develop the cancer risk profile of their new country, often within one to two generations, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer.[51][52] A recent prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholate as well as other specific bile acids and colorectal cancer risk in women.[53]\n\n\n\n### Obesity[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCancers related to obesity[54]\n| Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer | Colorectal cancer |\n| Esophageal adenocarcinoma | Endometrial cancer |\n| Kidney cancer | Esophageal adenocarcinoma |\n| Pancreatic cancer | Gallbladder cancer |\n| Thyroid cancer | Kidney cancer |\n|  | Pancreatic cancer |\n|  | Post-menopausal breast cancer |\n\n\nIn the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.[34] Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.[54] Individuals who underwent bariatric surgery for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.[54]\n\n\nThere is an association between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.[54] Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.[55] The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones (estrogens, androgens and progestogens).[54] Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.[56] Adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage and cancer associated genetic instability.[57]\n\n\nPhysical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on immune system and endocrine system.[34] More than half of the effect from diet is due to overnutrition rather than from eating too little healthy foods.[54]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macroscopic appearance of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.\nSome hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[58] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[59]\n\n\nHormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[58] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[58] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.[58] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[58]\n\n\nOther factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[58] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[58] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.[58] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[58]\n\n\nSome treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.[58] Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the selective estrogen-receptor modulator tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, aromatase inhibitors, now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n## Infection and inflammation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Infectious causes of cancer\n\nWorldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to infectious diseases.[9][60] This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[9] Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.\n\n\n\n### Viruses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.\nViral infection is a major risk factor for cervical and liver cancer.[61] A virus that can cause cancer is called an *oncovirus*. These include human papillomavirus (cervical carcinoma), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias).\n\n\nIn Western developed countries, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common oncoviruses.[62] In the United States, HPV causes most cervical cancers, as well as some cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, throat, tongue and tonsils.[63] Among high-risk HPV viruses, the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins inactivate tumor suppressor genes when infecting cells. In addition, the oncoproteins independently induce genomic instability in normal human cells, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.[64] Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are more than 200 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected individuals.[65] Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or excessive alcohol use, is independently associated with the development of liver cancer, but the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development.[65]\n\n\n\n### Bacteria and parasites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathology of *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs within the lining of the bladder.Certain bacterial infections also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.[66] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* causes cancer may involve chronic inflammation or the direct action of some of the bacteria's virulence factors.[67] Parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include *Schistosoma haematobium* (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, *Opisthorchis viverrini* and *Clonorchis sinensis* (cholangiocarcinoma).[68] Inflammation triggered by the worm's eggs appears to be the cancer-causing mechanism. Certain parasitic infections can also increase the presence of carcinogenic compounds in the body, leading to the development of cancers.[69] Tuberculosis infection, caused by the mycobacterium *M. tuberculosis*, has also been linked with the development of lung cancer.[70]\n\n\n### Inflammation[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that inflammation itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.[71] Chronic inflammation can lead to DNA damage over time and the accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.[72] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing tumor microenvironment.[73] Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers.[13]\n\n\n\n## Radiation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radiation-induced cancer\n\nUp to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation.[9] Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a chromosome, it can break the chromosome, result in an abnormal number of chromosomes, inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause chromosome translocations, or cause other types of chromosome abnormalities.[74] Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes were damaged by the radiation.[74] Three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation: morphological changes to the cell, acquiring cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.[74] Even if the radiation particle does not strike the DNA directly, it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations.[74]\n\n\n\n### Non-ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energy to break chemical bonds. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission, and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.[75][76] However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.[77]\n\n\nHigher-energy radiation, including ultraviolet radiation (present in sunlight), x-rays, and gamma radiation, generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[78] The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[78]\n\n\n\n### Ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging, and radon gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[74] Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[74] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear.[74] Radiation-induced meningiomas are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.[79] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma, are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.[74] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[74]\n\n\nIonizing radiation is also used in some kinds of medical imaging. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. Radiotherapy deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.[80]\n\n\nResidential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[74] Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.[74] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.[74]\n\n\n\n## Rare causes[edit]\n\n\n### Organ transplantation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.\nThe development of donor-derived tumors from organ transplants is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be malignant melanoma, that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.[81] There have also been reports of Kaposi's sarcoma occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.[82]\n\n\n\n### Trauma[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Marjolin's ulcer\n\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[83] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.[83] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.[83] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[83]\n\n\nFrequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[83] Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.[83] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.\n\n\n\n### Maternal-fetal transmission[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of acute leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma and carcinoma from mother to fetus has been observed.[84] Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by MHC incompatibility.[84] In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Basu, Ashis K (23 March 2018). \"DNA Damage, Mutagenesis and Cancer\". *Int.

The study of cancer epidemiology uses epidemiological methods to find the cause of cancer and to identify and develop improved treatments.\n\n\nThis area of study must contend with problems of lead time bias and length time bias. Lead time bias is the concept that early diagnosis may artificially inflate the survival statistics of a cancer, without really improving the natural history of the disease. Length bias is the concept that slower growing, more indolent tumors are more likely to be diagnosed by screening tests, but improvements in diagnosing more cases of indolent cancer may not translate into better patient outcomes after the implementation of screening programs. A related concern is overdiagnosis, the tendency of screening tests to diagnose diseases that may not actually impact the patient's longevity. This problem especially applies to prostate cancer and PSA screening.[3]\n\n\nSome cancer researchers have argued that negative cancer clinical trials lack sufficient statistical power to discover a benefit to treatment. This may be due to fewer patients enrolled in the study than originally planned.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Organizations[edit]\n\n\nState and regional cancer registries are organizations that abstract clinical data about cancer from patient medical records. These institutions provide information to state and national public health groups to help track trends in cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the largest and most important cancer registries is Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), administered by the US Federal government.[5]\n\n\nHealth information privacy concerns have led to the restricted use of cancer registry data in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs[6][7][8] and other institutions.[9] The American Cancer Society predicts that approximately 1,690,000 new cancer cases will be diagnosed and 577,000 Americans will ultimately die of cancer in 2012.[10]\n\n\n\n## Studies[edit]\n\n\nObservational epidemiological studies that show associations between risk factors and specific cancers mostly serve to generate hypotheses about potential interventions that could reduce cancer incidence or morbidity. Randomized controlled trials then test whether hypotheses generated by epidemiological studies and laboratory research actually result in reduced cancer incidence and mortality. In many cases, findings from observational epidemiological studies are not confirmed by randomized controlled trials.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The approximate relative levels of the preventable causes of cancer in the United States, taken from the article Cancer prevention.\nThe most significant risk factor is age. According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, \"If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer.\"[11] Essentially all of the increase in cancer rates between prehistoric times and people who died in England between 1901 and 1905 is due to increased lifespans.[11]\n\n\nAlthough the age-related increase in cancer risk is well-documented, the age-related patterns of cancer are complex. Some types of cancer, like testicular cancer, have early-life incidence peaks, for reasons unknown. Besides, the rate of age-related increase in cancer incidence varies between cancer types with, for instance, prostate cancer incidence accelerating much faster than brain cancer.[12] It has been proposed that the age distribution of cancer incidence can be viewed as the distribution of probability to accumulate the required number of driver events by the given age.[13][14]\n\n\nOver a third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75-80% of cancers in the United States[15]) are due to potentially modifiable risk factors. The leading modifiable risk factors worldwide are:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* tobacco smoking, which is strongly associated with lung cancer, mouth, and throat cancer;\n* drinking alcohol, which is associated with a small increase in oral, esophageal, breast, liver and other cancers;\n* a diet low in fruit and vegetables,\n* physical inactivity, which is associated with increased risk of colon, breast, and possibly other cancers\n* obesity, which is associated with colon, breast, endometrial, and possibly other cancers\n* sexual transmission of human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer and some forms of anal cancer, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer, rectal cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer.\n\n\nMen with cancer are twice as likely as women to have a modifiable risk factor for their disease.[16]\n\n\nOther lifestyle and environmental factors known to affect cancer risk (either beneficially or detrimentally) include the use of exogenous hormones (e.g., hormone replacement therapy causes breast cancer), exposure to ionizing radiation and ultraviolet radiation, and certain occupational and chemical exposures.[*citation needed*] A Western diet is associated with increased exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to bile acids that are produced by the body to digest fatty foods. Bile acids are likely endogenous etiologic agents in gastrointestinal cancer.[17]\n\n\nEvery year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.[18] Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces.[18] Currently, most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.[18] It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.[19]\n\n\n\n## Rates and mortality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New cancer diagnosis in the England in 2012\nIn the U.S. cancer is second only to cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death;[20] in the UK it is the leading cause of death.[21] In many developing countries cancer incidence (insofar as this can be measured) appears much lower, most likely because of the higher death rates due to infectious disease or injury. With the increased control over malaria and tuberculosis in some Third World countries, incidence of cancer is expected to rise; in the Eastern Mediterranean region, for example, cancer incidence is expected to increase by 100% to 180% in the next 15 years due to increases in life expectancy, an increasing proportion of elderly people, and the successful control of childhood disease.[22] This is termed the epidemiologic transition in epidemiological terminology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nCancer epidemiology closely mirrors risk factor spread in various countries. Hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) is rare in the West but is the main cancer in China and neighbouring countries, most likely due to the endemic presence of hepatitis B and aflatoxin in that population. Similarly, with tobacco smoking becoming more common in various Third World countries, lung cancer incidence has increased in a parallel fashion.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Registry Programme of the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), more than 1300 Indians die every day due to cancer. Between 2012 and 2014, the mortality rate due to cancer increased by approximately 6%. In 2012, there were 478,180 deaths out of 2,934,314 cases reported. In 2013 there were 465,169 deaths out of 3,016,628 cases. In 2014, 491,598 people died in out of 2,820,179 cases.[23]\nAccording to the Population Cancer Registry of Indian Council of Medical Research, the incidence and mortality of cancer is highest in the north-eastern region of the country.[24] Breast cancer is the most common, and stomach cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer for the population as a whole. Breast cancer and lung cancer kill the most women and men respectively.[25]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn Canada, as of 2007, cancer is the number one cause of death, contributing to 29.6% of all deaths in the country. The second highest cause of death is cardiovascular diseases resulting in 21.5% of deaths. As of 2011, prostate cancer was the most common form of cancer among males (about 28% of all new cases) and breast cancer the most common in females (also about 28% of all new cases).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe leading cause of death in both males and females is lung cancer, which contributes to 26.8% of all cancer deaths. Statistics indicate that between the ages of 20 and 50 years, the incidence rate of cancer is higher amongst women whereas after 50 years of age, the incidence rate increases in men. Predictions by the Canadian Cancer Society indicate that with time, there will be an increase in the rates of incidence of cancer for both males and females. Cancer will thus continue to be a persistent issue in years to come.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, cancer is responsible for 25% of all deaths with 30% of these from lung cancer. The most commonly occurring cancer in men is prostate cancer (about 25% of new cases) and in women is breast cancer (also about 25%). Cancer can occur in children and adolescents, but it is uncommon (about 150 cases per million in the U.S.), with leukemia the most common.[20] In the first year of life the incidence is about 230 cases per million in the U.S., with the most common being neuroblastoma.[26] Data from 2004 to 2008 in the United States indicates that the overall age-adjusted incidence of cancer was approximately 460 per 100,000 men and women per year.[27]\n\n\nCancer is responsible for about 25% of all deaths in the U.S., and is a major public health problem in many parts of the world. The statistics below are estimates for the U.S. in 2008, and may vary substantially in other countries. They exclude basal and squamous cell skin cancers, and carcinoma in situ in locations other than the urinary bladder.[20] As seen, breast/prostate cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer are responsible for approximately half of cancer incidence. The same applies for cancer mortality, but with lung cancer replacing breast/prostate cancer as the main cause.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease.[28]\n\n\n\n* ![Most common cancers in US males, by occurrence[20]](image)\n\nMost common cancers in US males, by occurrence[20]\n* ![in US males, by mortality[20]](image)\n\nin US males, by mortality[20]\n\n\n* ![in US females, by occurrence[20]](image)\n\nin US females, by occurrence[20]\n* ![in US females, by mortality[20]](image)\n\nin US females, by mortality[20]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Male |  | Female |\n| most common (by occurrence)[20] | most common (by mortality)[20] | most common (by occurrence)[20] | most common (by mortality)[20] |\n| prostate cancer (25%) | lung cancer (31%) | breast cancer (26%) | lung cancer (26%)\n |\n| lung cancer (15%) | prostate cancer (10%) | lung cancer (14%) | breast cancer (15%)\n |\n| colorectal cancer (10%) | colorectal cancer (8%) | colorectal cancer (10%) | colorectal cancer (9%)\n |\n| bladder cancer (7%) | pancreatic cancer (6%) | endometrial cancer (7%) | pancreatic cancer (6%)\n |\n| non-Hodgkin lymphoma (5%) | liver & intrahepatic bile duct (4%) | non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4%) | ovarian cancer (6%)\n |\n| skin melanoma (5%) | leukemia (4%) | thyroid cancer (4%) | non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3%)\n |\n| kidney cancer (4%) | esophageal cancer (4%) | Skin melanoma (4%) | leukemia (3%)\n |\n| oral and pharyngeal cancer (3%) | bladder cancer (3%) | ovarian cancer (3%) | uterine cancer (3%)\n |\n| leukemia (3%) | non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3%) | kidney cancer (3%) | liver & intrahepatic bile duct (2%)\n |\n| pancreatic cancer (3%) | kidney cancer (3%) | leukemia (3%) | brain and other nervous system (2%)\n |\n| other (20%) | other (24%) | other (22%) | other (25%)\n |\n\n\n### Incidence of a second cancer in survivors[edit]\n\n\nIn the developed world, one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetimes. If all cancer patients survived and cancer occurred randomly, the normal lifetime odds of developing a second primary cancer (not the first cancer spreading to a new site) would be one in nine.[29] However, cancer survivors have an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer, and the odds are about one in 4.5.[29] About half of these second primaries can be attributed to the normal one-in-nine risk associated with random chance.[29]\n\n\nThe increased risk is believed to be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, such as the person's genetic profile, alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, and environmental exposures, and partly due, in some cases, to the treatment for the first cancer, which might have included mutagenic chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation.[29] Cancer survivors may also be more likely to comply with recommended screening, and thus may be more likely than average to detect cancers.[29]\n\n\n\n## Children[edit]\n\n\nChildhood cancer and cancer in adolescents is rare (about 150 cases per million yearly in the US). Leukemia (usually acute lymphoblastic leukemia) is the most common cancer in children aged 1–14 in the U.S., followed by the central nervous system cancers, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[20] Statistics from the SEER program of the US NCI demonstrate that childhood cancers increased 19% between 1975 and 1990, mainly due to an increased incidence in acute leukemia. Since 1990, incidence rates have decreased.[30]\n\n\n\n## Infants[edit]\n\n\nThe age of peak incidence of cancer in children occurs during the first year of life, in infants. The average annual incidence in the United States, 1975–1995, was 233 per million infants.[30] Several estimates of incidence exist. According to SEER,[30] in the United States:\n\n\n\n* Neuroblastoma comprised 28% of infant cancer cases and was the most common malignancy among these young children (65 per million infants).\n* The leukemias as a group (41 per million infants) represented the next most common type of cancer, comprising 17% of all cases.\n* Central nervous system malignancies comprised 13% of infant cancer, with an average annual incidence rate of nearly 30 per million infants.\n* The average annual incidence rates for malignant germ cell and malignant soft tissue tumors were essentially the same at 15 per million infants. Each comprised about 6% of infant cancer.\n\n\nTeratoma (a germ cell tumor) often is cited as the most common tumor in this age group, but most teratomas are surgically removed while still benign, hence not necessarily cancer. Prior to the widespread routine use of prenatal ultrasound examinations, the incidence of sacrococcygeal teratomas diagnosed at birth was 25 to 29 per million births.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFemale and male infants have essentially the same overall cancer incidence rates, a notable difference compared to older children.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhite infants have higher cancer rates than black infants. Leukemias accounted for a substantial proportion of this difference: the average annual rate for white infants (48.7 per million) was 66% higher than for\nblack infants (29.4 per million).[30]\n\n\nRelative survival for infants is very good for neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor and retinoblastoma, and fairly good (80%) for leukemia, but not for most other types of cancer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by cancer rate\n* Epidemiology of breast cancer\n* Cancer cluster\n* Cancer research\n* Genetic epidemiology\n* Incidentaloma, a symptom-free tumor that is found accidentally and whose treatment may be unimportant\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"WHO Disease and injury country estimates\". *World Health Organization*. 2009.

The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and genomic instability.[1][2] A minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations.[3] Most cancers are related to environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures.[4] Cancer is generally not contagious in humans, though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria. The term \"environmental\", as used by cancer researchers, refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans.[5] The environment is not limited to the biophysical environment (e.g. exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight), but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors.[6]\n\n\nOver one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75–80% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors.[7][8] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25–30% of cancer deaths), environmental pollutants, diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%).[9] These factors act, at least partly, by altering the function of genes within cells.[10] Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[10] Aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect to consider when evaluating the risk factors for the development of particular cancers. Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n![](image)Multiple colon polyps within the colon of an individual with familial adenomatous polyposis\nAlthough there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.[3] The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (\"sporadic cancers\"). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A cancer syndrome or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.\n\n\nMany of the cancer syndrome cases are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of DNA repair genes, oncogenes and genes involved in the production of blood vessels.[12] Certain inherited mutations in the genes *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[3] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of colon cancer cases.[13] In many cases, genetic testing can be used to identify mutated genes or chromosomes that are passed through generations.\n\n\nGene mutations are classified as *germline* or *somatic* depending on the cell type where they appear (germline cells include the egg and the sperm and somatic cells are those forming the body). The germline mutations are carried through generations and increase the risk of cancer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer syndromes[edit]\n\n\n* Ataxia–telangiectasia\n* Bloom syndrome\n* BRCA1 & BRCA2\n* Fanconi anemia\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n* Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n* Li–Fraumeni syndrome\n* Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome\n* Von Hippel–Lindau disease\n* Werner syndrome\n* Xeroderma pigmentosum\n\n\n## Physical and chemical agents[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carcinogen, Smoking and cancer, and Safety of electronic cigarettes\n\nParticular substances, known as carcinogens, have been linked to specific types of cancer. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.[14] It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.[15] Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.[16] Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers and tobacco smoke, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces.[16] Cancer related to one's occupation is believed to represent between 2–20% of all cases.[17] Most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.[16] Job stress does not appear to be a significant factor at least in lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.[18] Participation in Operation Ranchhand in Vietnam during the Vietnam war, or living near a golf course, or living on a farm would increase the risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma due to exposure to the chemical 2,4-D. When 2,4-D is mixed with another chemical pesticide or herbicide, 2,4-T, at a 50:50 ratio, they are collectively known as Agent Orange.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Share of cancer deaths attributed to tobacco in 2016.[19]\n![](image)The incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking.\nTobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer,[20] and causes 80% of lung cancer.[21] Decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung, larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[22] There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the gallbladder, the adrenal gland, the small intestine, and various childhood cancers.[22] Seven toxicants in cigarette smoke have been identified that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis.[23] The mechanism of action of two of them, acrylonitrile and acrolein, appears to involve oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage.[24][25] The other five toxicants, acetaldehyde, cadmium, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and isoprene act through various mechanisms including direct interaction with DNA. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[26] Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world,[20] and about one in five worldwide.[26] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[27][28] However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the *tobacco epidemic*.[29]\n\n\nElectronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that simulate the feeling of tobacco smoking. Daily long-term use of high voltage (5.0 V) electronic cigarettes may generate formaldehyde-forming chemicals at a greater level than smoking, which was determined to be a lifetime cancer risk of approximately 5 to 15 times greater than smoking.[30] However, the overall safety and long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes is still uncertain.[31]\n\n\n\n### Materials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asbestos body in a cytological slideSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.[32] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[32] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[32] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite).[32] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.[32] Common occupational carcinogens include:[33]\n\n\n* arsenic\n* asbestos\n* benzene\n* beryllium\n* cadmium\n* chromium\n* ethylene oxide\n* nickel\n* Plutonium\n\n\n## Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Alcohol and cancer, Diet and cancer, and Obesity and cancer\n\nMany different lifestyle factors contribute to increasing cancer risk. Together, diet and obesity are related to approximately 30–35% of cancer deaths.[9][34] Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and avoidance of processed meat, red meat, animal fats, and refined carbohydrates.[35] The evidence to support these dietary changes is not definitive.[36]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chronic damage due to alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis (pictured above) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer.Alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen. The World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen.[37] In Western Europe 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol.[38] Worldwide, 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol.[39] In particular, alcohol use has been shown to increase the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach, liver, ovaries, and colon.[40] The main mechanism of cancer development involves increased exposure to acetaldehyde, a carcinogen and breakdown product of ethanol.[41] Acetaldehyde induces DNA interstrand crosslinks, a form of DNA damage. These can be repaired by an inaccurate replication-coupled DNA repair pathway.[42] This repair pathway results in increased mutation frequency and altered mutational spectrum.[42] Other mechanisms have been proposed, including alcohol-related nutritional deficiencies, changes in DNA methylation, and induction of oxidative stress in tissues.[43]\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\nSome specific foods have been linked to specific cancers. Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.[44] This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.[45] Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.[46] A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminate, is associated with liver cancer. Betel nut chewing has been shown to cause oral cancers.[47]\n\n\nThe relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to the frequency of high-salt diets and colon cancer is more common in the United States due to the increased intake of processed and red meats.[48] Immigrant communities tend to develop the cancer risk profile of their new country, often within one to two generations, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer.[51][52] A recent prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholate as well as other specific bile acids and colorectal cancer risk in women.[53]\n\n\n\n### Obesity[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCancers related to obesity[54]\n| Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer | Colorectal cancer |\n| Esophageal adenocarcinoma | Endometrial cancer |\n| Kidney cancer | Esophageal adenocarcinoma |\n| Pancreatic cancer | Gallbladder cancer |\n| Thyroid cancer | Kidney cancer |\n|  | Pancreatic cancer |\n|  | Post-menopausal breast cancer |\n\n\nIn the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.[34] Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.[54] Individuals who underwent bariatric surgery for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.[54]\n\n\nThere is an association between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.[54] Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.[55] The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones (estrogens, androgens and progestogens).[54] Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.[56] Adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage and cancer associated genetic instability.[57]\n\n\nPhysical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on immune system and endocrine system.[34] More than half of the effect from diet is due to overnutrition rather than from eating too little healthy foods.[54]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macroscopic appearance of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.\nSome hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[58] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[59]\n\n\nHormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[58] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[58] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.[58] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[58]\n\n\nOther factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[58] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[58] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.[58] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[58]\n\n\nSome treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.[58] Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the selective estrogen-receptor modulator tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, aromatase inhibitors, now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n## Infection and inflammation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Infectious causes of cancer\n\nWorldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to infectious diseases.[9][60] This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[9] Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.\n\n\n\n### Viruses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.\nViral infection is a major risk factor for cervical and liver cancer.[61] A virus that can cause cancer is called an *oncovirus*. These include human papillomavirus (cervical carcinoma), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias).\n\n\nIn Western developed countries, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common oncoviruses.[62] In the United States, HPV causes most cervical cancers, as well as some cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, throat, tongue and tonsils.[63] Among high-risk HPV viruses, the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins inactivate tumor suppressor genes when infecting cells. In addition, the oncoproteins independently induce genomic instability in normal human cells, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.[64] Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are more than 200 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected individuals.[65] Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or excessive alcohol use, is independently associated with the development of liver cancer, but the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development.[65]\n\n\n\n### Bacteria and parasites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathology of *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs within the lining of the bladder.Certain bacterial infections also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.[66] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* causes cancer may involve chronic inflammation or the direct action of some of the bacteria's virulence factors.[67] Parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include *Schistosoma haematobium* (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, *Opisthorchis viverrini* and *Clonorchis sinensis* (cholangiocarcinoma).[68] Inflammation triggered by the worm's eggs appears to be the cancer-causing mechanism. Certain parasitic infections can also increase the presence of carcinogenic compounds in the body, leading to the development of cancers.[69] Tuberculosis infection, caused by the mycobacterium *M. tuberculosis*, has also been linked with the development of lung cancer.[70]\n\n\n### Inflammation[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that inflammation itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.[71] Chronic inflammation can lead to DNA damage over time and the accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.[72] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing tumor microenvironment.[73] Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers.[13]\n\n\n\n## Radiation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radiation-induced cancer\n\nUp to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation.[9] Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a chromosome, it can break the chromosome, result in an abnormal number of chromosomes, inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause chromosome translocations, or cause other types of chromosome abnormalities.[74] Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes were damaged by the radiation.[74] Three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation: morphological changes to the cell, acquiring cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.[74] Even if the radiation particle does not strike the DNA directly, it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations.[74]\n\n\n\n### Non-ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energy to break chemical bonds. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission, and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.[75][76] However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.[77]\n\n\nHigher-energy radiation, including ultraviolet radiation (present in sunlight), x-rays, and gamma radiation, generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[78] The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[78]\n\n\n\n### Ionizing radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging, and radon gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[74] Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[74] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear.[74] Radiation-induced meningiomas are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.[79] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma, are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.[74] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[74]\n\n\nIonizing radiation is also used in some kinds of medical imaging. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. Radiotherapy deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.[80]\n\n\nResidential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[74] Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.[74] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.[74]\n\n\n\n## Rare causes[edit]\n\n\n### Organ transplantation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.\nThe development of donor-derived tumors from organ transplants is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be malignant melanoma, that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.[81] There have also been reports of Kaposi's sarcoma occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.[82]\n\n\n\n### Trauma[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Marjolin's ulcer\n\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[83] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.[83] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.[83] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[83]\n\n\nFrequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[83] Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.[83] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.\n\n\n\n### Maternal-fetal transmission[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of acute leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma and carcinoma from mother to fetus has been observed.[84] Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by MHC incompatibility.[84] In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Basu, Ashis K (23 March 2018). \"DNA Damage, Mutagenesis and Cancer\". *Int.

Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[1] Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body.[1] There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.[1]\n\n\nCancers are often described by the body part that they originated in. However, some body parts contain multiple types of tissue, so for greater precision, cancers are additionally classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells originated from. These types include:\n\n\n\n* *Carcinoma*: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers that occur in older adults. Nearly all cancers developing in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and colon are carcinomas.\n* *Sarcoma*: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside of the bone marrow.\n* *Lymphoma* and *leukemia*: These two classes of cancer arise from immature cells that originate in the bone marrow, and are intended to fully differentiate and mature into normal components of the immune system and the blood, respectively. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, accounting for ~30% of cases.[2] However, far more adults than children develop lymphoma and leukemia.\n* *Germ cell tumor*: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).\n* *Blastoma*: Cancers derived from immature \"precursor\" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are *generally* more common in children (e.g. neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, etc.) than in older adults.\n\n\nCancers are usually named using *-carcinoma*, *-sarcoma* or *-blastoma* as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, the most common cancer of the liver parenchyma (\"hepato-\" = liver), arising from malignant epithelial cells (\"carcinoma\"), would be called a *hepatocarcinoma*, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma. Similarly, a cancer arising from malignant fat cells would be termed a *liposarcoma*. \n\n\nFor some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called *ductal carcinoma of the breast*. \n\n\nBenign tumors (which are not cancers) are usually named using *-oma* as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a *leiomyoma* (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is *fibroid*). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the *-noma* suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.[3][4]\n\n\nSome types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and small-cell carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n## Bone and muscle sarcoma[edit]\n\n\n* Chondrosarcoma\n* Ewing's sarcoma\n* Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of
