Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\n\n\nApart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.\n\n\nThe frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Huayi tu*, an 1136 map of China with the Great Wall depicted on the northern edge of the country\nThe collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English.\n\n\nIn Chinese histories, the term \"Long Wall(s)\" (t 長城, s 长城, *Chángchéng*) appears in Sima Qian's *Records of the Grand Historian*, where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the Warring States and to the more unified construction of the First Emperor.[9] The Chinese character 城, meaning city or fortress, is a phono-semantic compound of the \"earth\" radical 土 and phonetic 成, whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as \\**deŋ*.[10] It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded traditional Chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls around their respective states; today, however, it is much more often the Chinese word for \"city\".[11]\n\n\nThe longer Chinese name \"Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall\" (t 萬里長城, s 万里长城, *Wànlǐ Chángchéng*) came from Sima Qian's description of it in the *Records*, though he did not name the walls as such. The AD 493 *Book of Song* quotes the frontier general Tan Daoji referring to \"the long wall of 10,000 miles\", closer to the modern name, but the name rarely features in pre-modern times otherwise.[12] The traditional Chinese mile (里, *lǐ*) was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually standardized at distances around a third of an English mile (540 m).[13] However, this use of \"ten-thousand\" (*wàn*) is figurative in a similar manner to the Greek and English *myriad* and simply means \"innumerable\" or \"immeasurable\".[14]\n\n\nBecause of the wall's association with the First Emperor's supposed tyranny, the Chinese dynasties after Qin usually avoided referring to their own additions to the wall by the name \"Long Wall\".[15] Instead, various terms were used in medieval records, including \"frontier(s)\" (塞, *Sài*),[16] \"rampart(s)\" (垣, *Yuán*),[16] \"barrier(s)\" (障, *Zhàng*),[16] \"the outer fortresses\" (外堡, *Wàibǎo*),[17] and \"the border wall(s)\" (t 邊牆, s 边墙, *Biānqiáng*).[15] Poetic and informal names for the wall included \"the Purple Frontier\" (紫塞, *Zǐsài*)[18] and \"the Earth Dragon\" (t 土龍, s 土龙, *Tǔlóng*).[19] Only during the Qing period did \"Long Wall\" become the catch-all term to refer to the many border walls regardless of their location or dynastic origin, equivalent to the English \"Great Wall\".[20]\n\n\nSections of the wall in south Gobi Desert and Mongolian steppe are sometimes referred to as \"Wall of Genghis Khan\", even though Genghis Khan did not construct any walls or permanent defense lines himself.[21]\n\n\nThe current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers.[20] By the nineteenth century,[20] \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".[14]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Great Wall of China\n\n### Early walls[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Great Wall of Qi\n\n![](image)The Great Wall of the Qin stretches from Lintao to Liaodong.\nThe Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.[22] During this time and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and Zhongshan[23][24] all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Wall of the Han is the longest of all walls, from Mamitu, near Yumenguan, to Liaodong.\nKing Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (\"Qin Shi Huang\") in 221 BC. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states. To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, however, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier. \"Build and move on\" was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall, implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border.[25]\n\n\nTransporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands[26] of workers died building the Qin wall. Later, the Han,[27] the Northern dynasties and the Sui all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.[28] The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region.[28] Dynasties founded by non-Han ethnic groups also built their border walls: the Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei, the Khitan-ruled Liao, Jurchen-led Jin and the Tangut-established Western Xia, who ruled vast territories over Northern China throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls but those were located much to the north of the other Great Walls as we know it, within China's autonomous region of Inner Mongolia and in modern-day Mongolia itself.[29]\n\n\n\n### Ming era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ming Great Wall\n\n![](image)The extent of the Ming Empire and its walls\nThe Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century,[30] and following the Ming army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the Mongol tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.\n\n\nUnlike the earlier fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth. Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall.[31] As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong.[32] Qi Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall, faced sections of the ram-earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders.[33] During the 1440s–1460s, the Ming also built a so-called \"Liaodong Wall\". Similar in function to the Great Wall (whose extension, in a sense, it was), but more basic in construction, the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province, protecting it against potential incursions by Jurchen-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north. While stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong Wall, most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.[34]\n\n\nTowards the end of the Ming, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600. Even after the loss of all of Liaodong, the Ming army held the heavily fortified Shanhai Pass, preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun dynasty. Before this time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time it was for conquest. The gates at Shanhai Pass were opened on May 25 by the commanding Ming general, Wu Sangui, who formed an alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing.[35] The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and eventually defeated both the Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, consolidating the rule of the Qing dynasty over all of China proper.[36]\n\n\nUnder Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so constructions on the Great Wall were discontinued. On the other hand, the so-called Willow Palisade, following a line similar to that of the Ming Liaodong Wall, was constructed by the Qing rulers in Manchuria. Its purpose, however, was not defense but rather to prevent Han Chinese migration into Manchuria.[37]\n\n\n\n### Foreign accounts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Part of the Great Wall of China (April 1853, X, p. 41)[38]\n![](image)The Great Wall in 1907\nNone of the Europeans who visited China or Mongolia in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, William of Rubruck, Marco Polo, Odoric of Pordenone and Giovanni de' Marignolli, mentioned the Great Wall.[39][40]\n\n\nThe North African traveler Ibn Battuta, who also visited China during the Yuan dynasty c. 1346, had heard about China's Great Wall, possibly before he had arrived in China.[41] He wrote that the wall is \"sixty days' travel\" from Zeitun (modern Quanzhou) in his travelogue *Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling*. He associated it with the legend of the wall mentioned in the Qur'an,[42] which Dhul-Qarnayn (commonly associated with Alexander the Great) was said to have erected to protect people near the land of the rising sun from the savages of Gog and Magog. However, Ibn Battuta could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that although there were remnants of the wall at that time, they were not significant.[43]\n\n\nSoon after Europeans reached Ming China by ship in the early 16th century, accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European was to see it for another century. Possibly one of the earliest European descriptions of the wall and of its significance for the defense of the country against the \"Tartars\" (i.e. Mongols) may be the one contained in João de Barros's 1563 *Asia*.[44] Other early accounts in Western sources include those of Gaspar da Cruz, Bento de Goes, Matteo Ricci, and Bishop Juan González de Mendoza,[45] the latter in 1585 describing it as a \"superbious and mightie work\" of architecture, though he had not seen it.[46] In 1559, in his work \"A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions\", Gaspar da Cruz offers an early discussion of the Great Wall.[45] Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India.[47] Early European accounts were mostly modest and empirical, closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall,[48] although later they slid into hyperbole,[49] including the erroneous but ubiquitous claim that the Ming walls were the same ones that were built by the first emperor in the 3rd century BC.[49]\n\n\nWhen China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.[50]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\nA formal definition of what constitutes a \"Great Wall\" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety.[51] The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.\n\n\nIn 2012, based on existing research and the results of a comprehensive mapping survey, the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China concluded that the remaining Great Wall associated sites include 10,051 wall sections, 1,764 ramparts or trenches, 29,510 individual buildings, and 2,211 fortifications or passes, with the walls and trenches spanning a total length of 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi).[3] Incorporating advanced technologies, the study has concluded that the Ming Great Wall measures 8,850 km (5,500 mi).[52] This consists of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) of wall sections, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.[52] In addition, Qin, Han and earlier Great Wall sites are 3,080 km (1,914 mi) long in total; Jin dynasty (1115–1234) border fortifications are 4,010 km (2,492 mi) in length; the remainder date back to Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui, Tang, the Five Dynasties, Song, Liao and Xixia.[3] About half of the sites are located in Inner Mongolia (31%) and Hebei (19%).[3]\n\n\n\n### Han Great Wall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Great Wall of Han dynasty near Yumenguan\nHan fortifications starts from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, *Mǎmítú*, l \"horses losing their way\") near Yumen Pass.\n\n\n\n### Ming Great Wall[edit]\n\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From Jiayu Pass the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关, *Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi province, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.\n\n\nThe sections of the Great Wall around Beijing municipality are especially famous: they were frequently renovated and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, for this was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China, as well as the showpiece stretch for foreign dignitaries.[53] The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated.[54] South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 m (25 ft 7 in) high and 5 m (16 ft 5 in) wide.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ming dynasty Great Wall at Jinshanling\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11 km (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 m (16 ft 5 in to 26 ft 3 in) in height, and 6 m (19 ft 8 in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in) across the top. Wangjing Lou (t 望京樓, s 望京楼, *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.[55]\n\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城, *Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall.[56] 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices.[57] In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.[58]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\nBefore the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, lime, and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall. Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm (12 in) tall, and about 23 cm (9.1 in) wide. From the parapets, guards could survey the surrounding land.[59]\n\n\nSticky rice mortar, consisting of sticky rice soup mixed with slaked lime, was extensively used to hold bricks together;[60][61] no human bones or body parts were ever incorporated into the mortar or any part of the wall, contrary to what a legend states.[62][63] Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility. Wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through. Barracks, stables, and armories were built near the wall's inner surface.[59]\n\n\n\n## Condition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A more rural portion of the Great Wall that stretches through the mountains, here seen in slight disrepair\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads.[64] Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi.[65] Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.[66]\n\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished.[65] In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion.[67] In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.[68]\n\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".[69]\n\n\n\n## Visibility from space[edit]\n\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n\n\n### From the Moon[edit]\n\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon.[70] Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked,[71] it is still ingrained in popular culture.[72] The apparent width of the Great Wall from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.[73]\n\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth that the Great Wall can be seen from the moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"[74] The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895 where he states \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\"[75] The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the moon also appears in 1932's *Ripley's Believe It or Not!* strip.[76]\n\n\n\n### From low Earth orbit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Identical satellite images of a section of the Great Wall in northern Shanxi, running diagonally from lower left to upper right and not to be confused with the more prominent river running from upper left to lower right. In the image on the right, the Great Wall has been outlined in red. The region pictured is 12 km × 12 km (7 mi × 7 mi).\nA more controversial question is whether the wall is visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude of as little as 160 km (100 mi)). NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.[77]\n\n\nVeteran US astronaut Gene Cernan has stated: \"At Earth orbit of 100 to 200 miles [160 to 320 km] high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye.\" Ed Lu, Expedition 7 Science Officer aboard the International Space Station, adds that, \"It's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look.\"\n\n\nIn October 2003, Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi), the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye.[73] The image was actually a river in Beijing.[78]\n\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the *China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.[79][73]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Great Wall at Badaling](image)\n\nThe Great Wall at Badaling\n* ![The Great Wall at dawn](image)\n\nThe Great Wall at dawn\n* ![The Juyongguan area of the Great Wall accepts numerous tourists each day.](image)\n\nThe Juyongguan area of the Great Wall accepts numerous tourists each day.\n* ![Remains of Beacon tower, near Yumenguan, 2011](image)\n\nRemains of Beacon tower, near Yumenguan, 2011\n* ![\"The First Mound\" – at Jiayu Pass, the western terminus of the Ming wall](image)\n\n\"The First Mound\" – at Jiayu Pass, the western terminus of the Ming wall\n* ![The Great Wall near Jiayu Pass, Qilian Mountains in behind](image)\n\nThe Great Wall near Jiayu Pass, Qilian Mountains in behind\n* ![Ming Great Wall remnant, near Yinchuan](image)\n\nMing Great Wall remnant, near Yinchuan\n* ![The Great Wall remnant at Yulin](image)\n\nThe Great Wall remnant at Yulin\n* ![Gateway of Gubeikou Fortress](image)\n\nGateway of Gubeikou Fortress\n* ![Environmental protection sign, near Great Wall, 2011](image)\n\nEnvironmental protection sign, near Great Wall, 2011\n* ![Ming Great Wall at Simatai, overlooking the gorge](image)\n\nMing Great Wall at Simatai, overlooking the gorge\n* ![Mutianyu Great Wall.

Beginning as separate sections of fortification around the 7th century B.C.E and unified during the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century B.C.E, this wall, built of earth and rubble with a facing of brick or stone, runs from east to west across China for over 4,000 miles.\n5. **^** \"Great Wall of China\". *Encyclopædia Britannica*. Large parts of the fortification system date from the 7th through the 4th century BC. In the 3rd century BC Shihuangdi (Qin Shi Huang), the first emperor of a united China (under the Qin dynasty), connected a number of existing defensive walls into a single system. Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) on the coast of the Bohai (Gulf of Zhili), and the wall's length – without its branches and other secondary sections – was thought to extend for some 6,690 km (4,160 mi).\n6. **^** Shelach-Lavi, Gideon; Wachtel, Ido; Golan, Dan; Batzorig, Otgonjargal; Amartuvshin, Chunag; Ellenblum, Ronnie; Honeychurch, William (June 2020). \"Medieval long-wall construction on the Mongolian Steppe during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries AD\". *Antiquity*. **94** (375): 724–741. doi:10.15184/aqy.2020.51.

Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved;[5] it was famously called \"a rose-red city half as old as time\" in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[6] Access to the city is through a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cliffs near Petra, View over Wadi Arabah\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[7] and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[8] Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[9] by which time Petra had become their capital.[7] The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.[7][10]\n\n\nThe trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture, and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[11] Most of the famous rock-cut buildings, which are mainly tombs, date from this and the following period. Much less remains of the free-standing buildings of the city.\n\n\nAlthough the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea.[12] Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.[13]\n\n\nIt has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\".[14] In 2007, Petra was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[15] Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark.[16] Tourism in the historical city was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after started to pick up again, reaching 905,000 visitors in 2022.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Neolithic[edit]\n\n\nBy 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.[7]\n\n\n\n### Bronze Age[edit]\n\n\nPetra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as *Pel*, *Sela*, or *Seir*.[18]\n\n\n\n### Iron Age Edom[edit]\n\n\nThe Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. This came when the Edomites rebelled after the death of King Solomon in 928 BC when Israel split into two kingdoms for Israel to be in the north and Judah in the south. The Edomites were known as descendents of Esau and this was referenced in the Old Testament of the Bible.[19] The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping ground for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and wood.\n\n\nInitially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. They were then engaged in battle with King Amaziah of Judah and chased back into their own lands. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.[20]\n\n\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).[21]\n\n\n\n### Emergence of Petra[edit]\n\n\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.[8] Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.[22] Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as *rqmw* or *rqm*.[4]\n\n\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called *Rekeme* by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7).[23] The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra.[24] Arabic *raqama* means \"to mark, to decorate\", so *Rekeme* could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).[25][26]\n\n\n\nSee also: Sela (Edom) § Confusion with Petra\n\nAn old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called *sela* in the Hebrew Bible. *Encyclopædia Britannica* (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that *sela* simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom. [6]\n\n\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.[6][27]\n\n\n\n### Roman period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General view\n![](image)Roman bronze coin of Geta showing the Petra temple with statue of Tyche\nFurther information: History of the Romans in Arabia\n\nIn AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital.[28] The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire.[6]\n\n\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130–270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315–403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou (Chaabou) and her offspring Dushara.[6] Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.[29]\n\n\nBetween 111 and 114 Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the *Pax Romana*, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks[*dubious – discuss*] in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of *Hadriānī Petra Metropolis*, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\n\n\nThe interest that Roman emperors showed in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the *temenos* of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century.[30] The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. Petra may be seen on the Madaba mosaic map from the reign of Emperor Justinian.\n\n\n\n### Byzantine period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Byzantine Church\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system.[31] The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century.[32] The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\n\n\nThe last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the *Spiritual Meadow* of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.[33]\n\n\n\n### Crusaders and Mamluks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alwaeira Castle\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century.[34][35]\n\n\nTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\n\n\nThe ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.[6]\n\n\n\n### 19th and 20th centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Petra Siq in 1947 (left) compared with the same location in 2013\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812.[6][36] At that time, the Greek Church of Jerusalem operated a diocese in Al Karak named Battra (باطره in Arabic, and Πέτρας in Greek) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.[36]\n\n\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.[37]\n\n\nLéon de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828.[38] The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in *The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia*. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting *El Khasné, Petra* is among his most important and well-documented.[38] Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.\n\n\n\n![](image)the \"Street of Facades\"\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[39]\n\n\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[40]\n\n\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.[41]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.[42]\n\n\n\n## Layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The narrow passage (Siq) that leads to Petra\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.[43][44]\n\n\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.[45]\n\n\n\n### Hellenistic architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hadrian Gate also known as the Temenos Gate\nPetra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures which the Nabataens traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.[46]\n\n\nPerhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79 ft) wide and 37 meters (121 ft) tall and references the architecture of Alexandria.[47] The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.[46]\n\n\nAnother prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148 ft) tall and 50 meters (160 ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture.[46] Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26 ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.\n\n\n\n### City centre[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Theatre\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.[45] A little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called *en-Nejr*, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.[6] The theatre was said to hold around 8,500 people.[48] The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Petra Pool and Garden Complex\nThe Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area,[49] excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.[50][51][52]\n\n\nAhead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.[53]\n\n\n\n### High Place of Sacrifice[edit]\n\n\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is located at the top of Jebel Madbah Mountain.[54] The beginning of the hike is near Petra's theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.[55]\n\n\n\n### Royal Tombs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Royal Tombs in the southern part of the city\n\n![](image)The Palace Tomb\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.[56]\n\n\n\n### Exterior platform[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n## Religious importance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Petra\nFurther information: Nabataean religion\n\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Temple of Petra\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.[60]\n\n\nA stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (*melech*: king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (*qaus*: bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-'allahi: \"god decided\" (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi: \"gods covenant\" (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi \"Allah is peace\" and Shalm-allat, \"the peace of the goddess\". We also find Amat-allahi \"she-servant of god\" and Halaf-llahi \"the successor of Allah\".[61]\n\n\nRecently, Petra has been put forward as the original direction of Muslim prayer, the Qibla, by some in the revisionist school of Islamic studies, namely that the earliest mosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca.[62] However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques’ Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ad Deir (\"The Monastery\")\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\n\n\nChristianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian Emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine The Great. He began the initial spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Anhioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the \"tomb with the urn\"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title *Château de la Valée de Moyse* or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189.[6] It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[64]\n\n\nAccording to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.[65]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5 °C (59.9 °F). About 193 mm (7.60 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Petra\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 2.8(37.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 11.2(52.2)\n | 7.1(44.8)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 45(1.8)\n | 38(1.5)\n | 36(1.4)\n | 12(0.5)\n | 4(0.2)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 2(0.1)\n | 15(0.6)\n | 41(1.6)\n | 193(7.6)\n |\n| Source: Climate-Data.org, Climate data\n |\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\n\n![](image)Night event at Al-Khazneh\n![](image)Al-Khazneh, the most popular tourist attraction\nThe Bidoul/Bidul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process.[*citation needed*] They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.[66]\n\n\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Urn Tomb\nThe Bidouls belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed[68] in 2008.\n\n\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.[69]\n\n\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\n\n\n\n* A socio-economic perspective\n* The perspective of Petra Archaeological Park\n* The perspective of Petra's tourism product\n* A land use perspective\n* An environmental perspective\n\n\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling,[70] improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism.[71] The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New7Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign.[72]\n\n\nIn an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site.[73] Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation *Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction?* (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.[74]\n\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds.[75] The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers.[76] In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.[77][78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tomb of the Roman Soldier\nPetra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt[79] aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants.[80] However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers.[81] Since then regular archaeological excavations[82] and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra.[83] Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades.[84] The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.[85]\n\n\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra.[86] The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n\n\n\n* 1958 Restoration of the third pillar of the Treasury building (Al-Khazneh).

It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.[5] In reference to the site's name, for most English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' in *Picchu* is silent. In English, the name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/ *MAH-choo PEE-choo*[6][7] or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/ *MATCH-oo PEAK-choo*,[7][8] in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu],[9] and in Quechua (*Machu Pikchu*)[10] as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].\n\n\nThe Inca civilization had no written language and, after the discovery by a Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, by the end of the 16th-century no more Europeans visited the site until the 19th century, so far as is known, so there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the *Intihuatana*, the *Temple of the Sun*, and the *Temple of the Three Windows*. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared.[11] By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored[11] and restoration continues.[12] Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c. 1420–1532.[13] Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.[14][15]\n\n\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[3] In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nIn the Quechua language, *machu* means \"old\" or \"old person\", while *picchu* means \"pyramid; pointed, multi-sided solid; cone,\" though it may also refer to a \"portion of coca that is chewed.\"[17] Thus the name of the site is sometimes interpreted as \"old mountain\".[18] The site is on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks: Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu.[19]\n\n\nA study published in 2021 in *Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of the Institute of Andean Studies* suggests that, in the Quechua language, the abandoned Inca site was called \"Huayna Picchu\", after the smaller peak at the site, or perhaps, just \"Picchu\". Huayna means \"young\" in the Quechua language. The research documents that, starting in 1911 with the publications of American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham, the name Machu Picchu became associated with the ruins.[14][20] Evidence of references by native Quechua speakers dating to their reports to the Aziz's island, early maps, and even discussions with Bingham, is cited in the new research into historical records regarding an apparently arbitrary selection of the name Bingham associated with the site—that differed from the traditional name.[21] The name given to the abandoned settlement by its builders has not been determined by researchers.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Photograph of Machu Picchu taken by Hiram Bingham III in 1912 after major clearing and before reconstruction work began[11][12]\nMachu Picchu was believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s.[22] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD.[23][24] Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).[25][26]: xxxvi\n\n\nThere is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered to be a \"royal\" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[22] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ancient life[edit]\n\n\n#### Daily life in Machu Picchu[edit]\n\n\nDuring its use as an estate, it is estimated that about 750 people lived there, with most serving as support staff (*yanaconas, yana)*[28][*page needed*][29] who lived there permanently. Though the estate belonged to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (*mayocs*) lived there as well, most likely for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staffing was reduced to about one hundred servants and a few religious specialists focused on maintenance alone.[28][*page needed*]\n\n\nStudies show that, according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been living there their entire lives. Instead, research into skeletal remains has found bone damage from various species of water parasites indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long-term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart.[30] These diets are composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the overall most recent short-term diet for these people was composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake.[29] Most skeletal remains found at the site had lower levels of arthritis and bone fractures than those found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals who had arthritis and bone fractures were typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the Mit'a) or served in the Inca military.[28][*page needed*]\n\n\nAnimals are also suspected to have migrated to Machu Picchu, as there were several bones found that were not native to the area. Most animal bones found were from llamas and alpacas. These animals naturally live at altitudes of 4,000 meters (13,000 ft) rather than the 2,400 meters (7,900 ft) elevation of Machu Picchu. Most likely, these animals were brought in from the Puna region[31] for meat consumption and for their pelts. Guinea pigs were also found at the site in special tomb caves, suggesting that they were at least used for funerary rituals,[28][*page needed*] as it was common throughout the Inca Empire to use them for sacrifices and meat.[32] Six dogs were also recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human remains, it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.[28][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Agricultural activity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terraces used for farming at Machu Picchu\nMuch of the farming done at Machu Picchu was done on its hundreds of man-made terraces. These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. Still visible are places where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area.[33] Terraces constructed overlooking the Urubamba River and many other springs provided fresh water for crop production and served more than 1,000 households.[34]\n\n\nHowever, terrace farming area makes up only about 4.9 ha (12 acres) of land, and a study of the soil around the terraces showed that what was grown there was mostly corn and potatoes, which was not enough to support the 750+ people living at Machu Picchu. This explains why studies done on the food that the Inca ate at Machu Picchu suggest it was imported from the surrounding valleys and farther afield.[30]\n\n\nIt is estimated that the area around the site has received more than 1,800 mm (71 in) of rain per year since AD 1450, which was more than that needed to support crop growth. Because of the ample rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not usually needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built by Incan engineers specifically to allow for ample drainage of excess water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright[35][36][37] in the 1990s showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel.[33] On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering it. Research showed that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much better than the soil higher up the mountain.[28][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Human sacrifice and mysticism[edit]\n\n\nLittle information describes human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements.[38] However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife.[38]: 107, 119 Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were more common and were made at the Altar of the Condor. The tradition is upheld[*when?*] by members of the New Age Andean religion.[39]: 263\n\n\n\n### Encounters with Westerners[edit]\n\n\n#### Spanish discovery[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 16th century, Spaniards who had recently gained control of the area documented that indigenous individuals mentioned returning to \"Huayna Picchu\", the name that is believed to be originally given to the site by locals.[14] The Spanish conquistador Baltasar de Ocampo had notes of a visit during the end of the 16th century to a mountain fortress called *Pitcos* with sumptuous and majestic buildings, erected with great skill and art, all the lintels of the doors, as well the principal as the ordinary ones, being of marble and elaborately carved.[40]\n\n\nOver the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been re-discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.[41] Some evidence indicates that the German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874.[42] A 1904 atlas designated the site as Huayna Picchu.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Search for the Inca capital[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nInscription \"A. Lizárraga 1902\" by Lizárraga on the central window of the Temple of the Three Windows\n\nIn 1911 American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham traveled the region looking for the old Inca capital and was led to Machu Picchu by a villager, Melchor Arteaga. Bingham found the name Agustín Lizárraga and the date 1902 written in charcoal on one of the walls of the Temple of the Three Windows. Initially disappointed, he documented in his pocket field journal: \"Agustín Lizárraga is discoverer of Machu Picchu and lives at San Miguel Bridge just before passing\".[43][44] However, while Bingham initially acknowledged Lizárraga as the discoverer in his early writings and speeches, including *Inca Land* (1922), he gradually downplayed Lizárraga's role until, in his final version of the story, *Lost City of the Incas* (1952), Bingham claimed to have found the site himself.[45]\n\n\nThough Bingham was not the first to visit the ruins, he was considered the scientific discoverer who brought Machu Picchu to international attention. Bingham organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation.[26]: xxx–xxxi[*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![Discovery plaques located near the entrance of Machu Picchu](image)Discovery plaques located near the entrance of Machu Picchu\n#### First American expedition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Melchor Arteaga crossing the Urubamba River on 24 July 1911\nBingham was a lecturer at Yale University, although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he travelled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at Choqquequirau in the Apurímac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of Vitcos. He consulted Carlos Romero, one of the chief historians in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father Antonio de la Calancha's Chronicle of the Augustinians. In particular, Ramos thought Vitcos was \"near a great white rock over a spring of fresh water.\" Back in Cusco again, Bingham asked planters about the places mentioned by Calancha, particularly along the Urubamba River. According to Bingham, \"one old prospector said there were interesting ruins at Machu Picchu,\" though his statements \"were given no importance by the leading citizens.\" Only later did Bingham learn that Charles Wiener also heard of the ruins at Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu, but was unable to reach them.[26][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hiram Bingham III at his tent door near Machu Picchu in 1912\nArmed with this information the expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route, Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins, especially any place described as having a white rock over a spring.[26]: 137[*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAt Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu.[46] The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Machu Picchu site. At the top of the mountain, they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of Quechua, Richard and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.[47]\n\n\nThe ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation, Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements, and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unclear about the original purpose of the ruins, but concluded there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos.[26]: 141, 186–187[*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nThe expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals, Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, Vitcos (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of Chuquipalta. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at Espíritu Pampa, which he named \"Trombone Pampa\".[48] As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, Gene Savoy further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as Vilcabamba Viejo, where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos.[49][26]: xxxv[*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nBingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic and with the full support of Peruvian President Leguia. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labor, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cusco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.[50][51]\n\n\nAlthough local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice.[52] Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. (In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum. Bingham was abiding by the 1852 Civil Code of Peru; the code stated that \"archaeological finds generally belonged to the discoverer, except when they had been discovered on private land.\" (Batievsky 100)[53]) Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history.[52] Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators.[52] By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions.[52]\n\n\n\n### Current state[edit]\n\n\n#### Preservation[edit]\n\n\nIn 1981, Peru declared an area of 325.92 square kilometers (125.84 sq mi) surrounding Machu Picchu a \"historic sanctuary\".[54] In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the flora and fauna of the Peruvian Yungas and Central Andean wet puna ecoregions.[55]\n\n\nBeyond its historical significance, Machu Picchu houses a diverse range of species. Among them are the Andean fox, puma, vizcacha, spectacled bear, and white-tailed deer. The sanctuary is also habitat for more than 420 bird species, notably the cock-of-the-rock and the Andean condor. The surrounding environment features a variety of tree species such as alder, white cedar, husk, and laurel.[56]\n\n\nIn 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a World Heritage Site, describing it as \"an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization\".[57]\n\n\n\n![Main Square of Aguas Calientes](image)Main Square of Aguas Calientes\n#### The modern town of Machu Picchu[edit]\n\n\nAlong the Urubamba river, below the ruins, surrounding the train line \"street\", is the town of Machu Picchu, also known as Aguas Calientes (hot springs), with a post office, a train station, many inexpensive and some expensive hotels, and other services for the many tourists. The station, called Puente Ruinas (the bridge to the ruins) is the end of the line for the *tren de turismo*, the tourist train, which arrives every morning from Cusco and returns every afternoon. There is a luxury hotel on the mountain, near the ruins.[58]\n\n\nMachu Picchu is officially twinned with Haworth, West Yorkshire in the United Kingdom,[59] as well as Fukushima, Japan;[60] Ōtama, Japan;[61] Petra, Jordan;[62] Medley, United States;[63] Tinum, Mexico[64]\n\n\n\n#### Tourist activity[edit]\n\n\nMachu Picchu is both a cultural and natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since its rediscovery in 1911, growing numbers of tourists have visited the site each year, with numbers exceeding 1.4 million in 2017.[65] As Peru's most visited tourist attraction, and a major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site.[66] Many people protested the plans, including Peruvians and foreign scientists, saying that more visitors would pose a physical burden on the ruins.[67] In 2018, plans were restarted to again construct a cable car to encourage Peruvians to visit Machu Picchu and boost domestic tourism.[68] A no-fly zone exists above the area.[69] UNESCO is considering putting Machu Picchu on its List of World Heritage in Danger.[66]\n\n\nDuring the 1980s, a large rock from Machu Picchu's central plaza was moved to a different location to create a helicopter landing zone. In the 1990s, the government prohibited helicopter landings. In 2006, a Cusco-based company, Helicusco, sought approval for tourist flights over Machu Picchu. The resulting license was soon rescinded.[70]\n\n\nTourist deaths have been linked to altitude sickness, floods and hiking accidents.[71][72][73][74] UNESCO received criticism for allowing tourists at the location given high risks of landslides, earthquakes and injury due to decaying structures.[75]\n\n\nIn 2014, nude tourism was a trend at Machu Picchu and Peru's Ministry of Culture denounced the activity. Cusco's Regional Director of Culture increased surveillance to end the practice.[76]\n\n\nFrom 1994 to 2019, the Chief of the National Archaeological Park of Machu Picchu was Fernando Astete, a Peruvian anthropologist and archaeologist, who worked for more than thirty years on the preservation, conservation and research of the site.[77] As a result of his research as director of the Park, the construction processes and functions of the sanctuary were acknowledged by the scientific community and a better understanding of the Inca landscape was given to the general public, who increasingly started to implement more sustainable tourism in the area, as a sign of respect for the site.[77]\n\n\nDuring the 2022–2023 Peruvian protests against Dina Boluarte and the Congress of Peru, protesters blocked various routes to Machu Picchu, trapping thousands of tourists at the mountain citadel in December 2022, resulting with the government having to airlift stranded visitors.[78][79] Due to the complications surrounding visitors and the protests, the Ministry of Culture closed Machu Picchu from the public indefinitely on 22 January 2023.[78][80] It reopened the next month, on 15 February 2023.[81]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMachu Picchu lies in the Southern Hemisphere, 13.111 degrees south of the equator.[82] It is 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,400 meters (11,200 ft).[82] As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.[83]\n\n\nMachu Picchu features wet humid summers and dry frosty winters, with the majority of the annual rain falling from March through to October.[82]\n\n\nMachu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 meters (1,480 ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river.[47] The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 meters (20 ft).\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Machu Picchu from Machu Picchu mountain surrounded by the Urubamba River\nThe city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu,[47] with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides.[84] Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.\n\n\nMachu Picchu and other sites in the area are built over earthquake faults. This may not be a coincidence, according to 2019 research: \"One simple answer, researchers now suggest, is that that's where building materials for the site—large amounts of already fractured rock—were readily available.\"[85]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Machu Picchu (elevation 2,399 m (7,871 ft), 1991–2020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 21.9(71.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 11.2(52.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 340.7(13.41)\n | 324.5(12.78)\n | 340.6(13.41)\n | 184.1(7.25)\n | 73.4(2.89)\n | 50.8(2.00)\n | 54.2(2.13)\n | 60.6(2.39)\n | 76.2(3.00)\n | 163.0(6.42)\n | 172.5(6.79)\n | 275.4(10.84)\n | 2,116(83.31)\n |\n| Source: National Meteorology and Hydrology Service of Peru[86] |\n\n## Site[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Machu Picchu\n### Layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Temple of the Three Windows*\nThe site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, and into an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower.[87]\n\n\nThe architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east–west central square. The various compounds, called *kanchas*, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the *Torreón*, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.[88]\n\n\nLocated in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the *Intihuatana*, the *Temple of the Sun* and the *Temple of the Three Windows*.\n\n\nThe Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.\n\n\nThe royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the *amautas* (wise people) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the *ñustas* (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices.\n\n\nThe Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the *wayrona* style.[89]\n\n\nIn 2005 and 2009, the University of Arkansas made detailed laser scans of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes.[90]\n\n\n\n### Sites of interest[edit]\n\n\n#### Temple of the Sun or Torreón[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temple of the Sun or TorreonThis semicircular temple is built on the same rock overlying Bingham's \"Royal Mausoleum\", and is similar to the Temple of the Sun found in Cusco and the Temple of the Sun found in Pisac, in having what Bingham described as a \"parabolic enclosure wall\". The stonework is of ashlar quality. Within the temple is a 1.2 m by 2.7 m rock platform, smooth on top except for a small platform on its southwest quadrant. A \"Serpent's Door\" faces 340°, or just west of north, opening onto a series of 16 pools, and affording a view of Huayna Picchu. The temple also has two trapezoidal windows, one facing 65°, called the \"Solstice Window\", and the other facing 132°, called the \"Qullqa Window\". The northwest edge of the rock platform points out the Solstice Window to within 2' of the 15th century June solstice rising Sun. For comparison, the angular diameter of the Sun is 32'. The Inca constellation Qullca, storehouse, can be viewed out the Qullqa Window at sunset during the 15th-century June Solstice, hence the window's name. At the same time, the Pleaides are at the opposite end of the sky. Also seen through this window on this night are the constellations Llamacnawin, Llama, Unallamacha, Machacuay, and the star Pachapacariq Chaska (Canopus).[91][92]\n\n![](image)*Intihuatana* is believed to have been designed as an astronomic clock or calendar by the Incas\n#### Intihuatana stone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Intihuatana, Urubamba\n\n![](image)The sculpture projecting from the rock bottom of the Sun temple is interpreted as \"Water mirrors for observing the sky\".[93]\nThe *Intihuatana* stone is one of many ritual stones in South America. These stones are arranged to point directly at the Sun during the winter solstice.[94] The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from Quechua language: *inti* means \"sun\", and *wata-*, \"to tie, hitch (up)\". The suffix *-na* derives nouns for tools or places. Hence *Intihuatana* is literally an instrument or place to \"tie up the sun\", often expressed in English as \"The Hitching Post of the Sun\". The Inca believed the stone held the Sun in its place along its annual path in the sky.[95] The stone is situated at 13°9'48\" S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the Sun is situated almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side.\n\n\n\n#### Inti Mach'ay and the Royal Feast of the Sun[edit]\n\n\nInti Mach'ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of *Qhapaq Raymi*. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sunrise.[96]\n\n\nArchitecturally, Inti Mach'ay is often considered to be the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps, and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to allow sunlight into the cave only during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year.[97] Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the \"Condor Stone.\" Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Dispute over cultural artifacts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Artifact collected on Bingham's 1912 expedition, on display at the Museo Machu Picchu\nIn 1912, 1914 and 1915, Bingham removed thousands of artifacts from Machu Picchu—ceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry, and human bones—and took them to Yale University for further study, supposedly for 18 months. Yale instead kept the artifacts until 2012, arguing that Peru lacked the infrastructure and systems to care for them. Eliane Karp, an anthropologist and wife of former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage. Many of the articles were exhibited at Yale's Peabody Museum.\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale returned some pieces but kept the rest, claiming this was supported by federal case law of Peruvian antiquities.[99] In 2007, Peru and Yale had agreed on a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco advised by Yale. Yale acknowledged Peru's title to all the objects, but would share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which would remain at Yale for continuing study.[100] In November 2010, Yale agreed to return the disputed artifacts.[101] The third and final batch of artifacts was delivered in November 2012.[102] The artifacts are permanently exhibited at the Museo Machu Picchu, La Casa Concha (\"The Shell House\"), close to Cusco's colonial center. Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad del Cusco, La Casa Concha also features a study area for local and foreign students.\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Incan architecture\n\n![](image)View of the residential section of Machu Picchu\n![](image)Funerary Stone in upper cemetery\nThe central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.\n\n\nThe site itself may have been intentionally built on fault lines to afford better drainage and a ready supply of fractured stone. \"Machu Picchu clearly shows us that the Incan civilization was an empire of fractured rocks\".[103]\n\n\nThe section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site,[104] lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms, and outside corners were often tied together by \"L\"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Machu Picchu\nHeavy rainfall required terraces and stone chips to drain rain water and prevent mudslides, landslides, erosion, and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt, and topsoil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding.[105] Multiple canals and reserves throughout the city provided water that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding.\n\n\nThe Incas never used wheels in a practical way, although their use in toys shows that they knew the principle. The use of wheels in engineering may have been limited due to the lack of strong draft animals, combined with steep terrain and dense vegetation.[106] The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; the knobs were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked.\n\n\n\n### Roads, entry and transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe Inca road system included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the *Titicaca* or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.[28][*page needed*]\n\n\nThousands of tourists walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year.[107] They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four- or five-day trip) or kilometer 104 (one- or two-day trip) near the town of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes to the isolated city.\n\n\nThe closest access point to Machu Picchu is the village of Machupicchu, also known as Aguas Calientes.\n\n\n\n#### Entrance restrictions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Artifact collected on Bingham's 1912 expedition, on display at the Museo Machu Picchu\nIn July 2011, the Dirección Regional de Cultura Cusco (DRC) introduced new entrance rules to the citadel of Machu Picchu.[108] The tougher entrance rules attempted to reduce the effects of tourism. Entrance was limited to 2,500 visitors per day, and entrance to Huayna Picchu (within the citadel) was further restricted to 400 visitors per day. In 2018, additional restrictions were placed on entrance. Three entrance phases will be implemented, increased from two phases previously, to further help the flow of traffic and reduce degradation of the site due to tourism.[109]\n\n\nIn May 2012, a team of UNESCO conservation experts called upon Peruvian authorities to take \"emergency measures\" to further stabilize the site's buffer zone and protect it from damage, particularly in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes, which had grown rapidly.[110]\n\n\n\n#### January 2010 evacuation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: El Niño-Southern Oscillation\n\nIn January 2010, heavy rain caused flooding that buried or washed away roads and railways to Machu Picchu, trapping more than 2,000 locals and more than 2,000 tourists, who were later airlifted out of the area. Machu Picchu was temporarily closed,[111] reopening on 1 April 2010.[112]\n\n\n\n#### Closure in 2023[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2023, the site was indefinitely shut down due to the 2022-2023 Peruvian unrest disrupting transportation that had left hundreds of tourists stranded.[80] It reopened the next month, in February.[81]\n\n\n\n## In media[edit]\n\n\n### Motion pictures[edit]\n\n\nThe Paramount Pictures film *Secret of the Incas* (1954), with Charlton Heston and Yma Sumac, was filmed on location at Cusco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed on site. Five hundred indigenous people were hired as extras in the film.[113]\n\n\nThe opening sequence of the film *Aguirre, the Wrath of God* (1972) was shot in the Machu Picchu area and on the stone stairway of Huayna Picchu.[114]\n\n\nMachu Picchu was featured prominently in the film *The Motorcycle Diaries* (2004), a biopic based on the 1952 youthful travel memoir of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.[115]\n\n\nThe *NOVA* television documentary \"Ghosts of Machu Picchu\" presents an elaborate documentary on the mysteries of Machu Picchu.[116]\n\n\nMultimedia artist Kimsooja used footage shot near Machu Picchu in the first episode of her film series *Thread Routes*, shot in 2010.[117]\n\n\nOn their 7th release, \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" (2023) brought the Autobots to Machu Picchu and more of Cusco's famous sites.[118]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe song \"Kilimanjaro\", from the Indian Tamil language film *Enthiran* (2010), was filmed in Machu Picchu.[119] The sanction for filming was granted only after direct intervention from the Indian government.[120][121]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![General view.](image)\n\nGeneral view.\n* ![Sunrise from Inti Punku, in the final stretch of the Inca Trail.](image)\n\nSunrise from Inti Punku, in the final stretch of the Inca Trail.\n* ![Detail of a trapezoidal window.](image)\n\nDetail of a trapezoidal window.\n* ![Colcas on the agricultural sector.](image)\n\n*Colcas* on the agricultural sector.\n* ![The Temple of the Condor.](image)\n\nThe Temple of the Condor.\n* ![Inca meteorology.](image)\n\nInca meteorology.\n* ![Terraces.](image)\n\nTerraces.\n* ![Detail of the wall's masonry.](image)\n\nDetail of the wall's masonry.\n* ![Llamas at Machu Picchu.](image)\n\nLlamas at Machu Picchu.\n* ![Residential area.](image)\n\nResidential area.\n* ![Cliff.](image)\n\nCliff.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Civilizations portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)Peru portal\n\n\n* Iperú, tourist information and assistance\n* Lares trek, an alternative route to that of the Inca Trail\n* List of archaeological sites in Peru\n* List of archaeoastronomical sites by country\n* Paleohydrology\n* Putucusi, neighboring mountain\n* Religion in the Inca Empire\n* Salcantay Trek – alternative trek to Machu Picchu\n* The Chilean Inca Trail\n* Tourism in Peru\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jarus, Owen (31 August 2012). \"Machu Picchu: Facts & History - Abandonment of Machu Picchu\". *Live Science*.

The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]\n\n\nChichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.\n\n\nChichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or *Tollans*, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.[3]\n\n\nThe ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.[nb 2]\n\n\nChichén Itzá is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and orthography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elaborate stone facades in Chichen Itza's \"Monjas\" complex in 1902\nThe Maya name \"Chichen Itza\" means \"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\" This derives from *chi'*, meaning \"mouth\" or \"edge\", and *chʼen* or *chʼeʼen*, meaning \"well\". *Itzá* is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\"[5] from *its* (itz), \"sorcerer\", and *ha*, \"water\".[6]\n\n\nThe name is spelled *Chichén Itzá* in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the modern Maya orthography, *Chichʼen Itzaʼ* (pronounced [tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ]). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between *chʼ* and *ch*, since the base word *chʼeʼen* (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. Traditional Yucatec Maya spelling in Latin letters, used from the 16th through mid 20th century, spelled it as \"Chichen Itza\" (as accents on the last syllable are usual for the language, they are not indicated as they are in Spanish). The word \"Itzaʼ\" has a high tone on the \"a\" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEvidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as *Uuc Yabnal* (\"Seven Great House\"),[7] *Uuc Hab Nal* (\"Seven Bushy Places\"),[8] *Uucyabnal* (\"Seven Great Rulers\")[2] or *Uc Abnal* (\"Seven Lines of Abnal\").[nb 3] This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.[9]\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pisté, Yucatán\n\n![](image)Aerial view of a small portion of Chichen Itza\nChichén Itzá is located in the eastern portion of Yucatán state in Mexico.[10] The northern Yucatán Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \"Cenote Sagrado\" or \"Sacred Cenote\" (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous.[11] In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists.[12]\n\n\nAccording to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains.[11] A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.[13]\n\n\n\n## Political organization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Columns in the Temple of a Thousand Warriors\nSeveral archeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichén Itzá may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a \"*multepal*\" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.[14]\n\n\nThis theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the \"multepal\" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico.[15]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nChichén Itzá was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee.[16] Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast,[17] Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America.\n\n\nBetween AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port.[18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Grand Ballcourt structures\nThe layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD.[19] Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula.[20] The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.[21]\n\n\n\n### Establishment[edit]\n\n\nThe Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.[22]\n\n\n\n### Ascendancy[edit]\n\n\nChichén Itzá rose to regional prominence toward the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, toward the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.\n\n\nAs Chichén Itzá rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) and Coba (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.[23]\n\n\n\n### Decline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| Maya civilization |\n| ![Drawing of a Mayan stone carving with elaborate decoration.](image) |\n| * People\n* Society\n* Languages\n* Writing\n* Religion\n* Mythology\n* Sacrifice\n* Cities\n* Architecture\n* Astronomy\n* Calendar\n* Stelae\n* Art\n* Textiles\n* Trade\n* Music\n* Dance\n* Medicine\n* Cuisine\n* Warfare\n |\n| History |\n| * Preclassic Maya\n* Classic Maya collapse\n |\n| Spanish conquest of the Maya |\n| * Yucatán\n* Chiapas\n* Guatemala\n* Petén\n\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| * ![](image) Mesoamerica portal\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nAccording to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, ruler of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.\n\n\nWhile there is some archeological evidence that indicates Chichén Itzá was at one time looted and sacked,[24] there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chichén Itzá was an active urban center. Archeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1100, before the rise of Mayapan. Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum.\n\n\nAfter Chichén Itzá elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there.[25] According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the Cenote Sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage.[26]\n\n\n\n### Spanish conquest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Spanish conquest of Yucatán\n\nIn 1526, Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucatán. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucatán Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at Xaman Haʼ, south of what is today Cancún. Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast.[27] He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning was to go to Chichén Itzá and establish a capital.[28]\n\n\nMontejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichén Itzá, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all-out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chichén Itzá in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucatán Peninsula.[29]\n\n\nMontejo eventually returned to Yucatán and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula.[30] The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.[31]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A photograph of Chichen Itza in 1859–1860 by Désiré Charnay, before vegetation was removed\nChichén Itzá entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book *Incidents of Travel in Yucatan* by John Lloyd Stephens (with illustrations by Frederick Catherwood). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucatán and his tour of Maya cities, including Chichén Itzá. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, Désiré Charnay surveyed Chichén Itzá and took numerous photographs that he published in *Cités et ruines américaines* (1863).\n\n\nVisitors to Chichén Itzá during the 1870s and 1880s came with photographic equipment and recorded more accurately the condition of several buildings.[32] In 1875, Augustus Le Plongeon and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon visited Chichén, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it \"Chaacmol\" (later renamed \"Chac Mool\", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). Teobert Maler and Alfred Maudslay explored Chichén in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, *Biologia Centrali-Americana*.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Kukulcán Temple, photograph by Teobert Maler, 1892\nIn 1894 the United States Consul to Yucatán, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chichén, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.\n\n\nIn 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archeologist Sylvanus G. Morley and committed to conduct long-term archeological research at Chichen Itza.[33] The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chichen Itza, Carnegie Project staff, 1924: left to right, J.O. Kilmartin, engineer, U.S. Geological Survey; Monroe Amsden, assistant archeologist; Earl H. Morris, archeologist in charge of excavations; Ann Axtell Morris, artist; S.G. Morley, Carnegie Institution associate in charge\nIn 1923, the Mexican government awarded the Carnegie Institution a 10-year permit (later extended another 10 years) to allow U.S. archeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of Chichen Itza.[35] Carnegie researchers excavated and restored the Temple of Warriors and the Caracol, among other major buildings. At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcán) and the Great Ball Court.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Excavations next to the Temple of Kukulcán (\"El Castillo\") began in 2009\nIn 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chichén. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucatán. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book *People of the Serpent* published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.[37]\n\n\nThere have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado, in 1961 and 1967. The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archeological zone, including the Osario, Akab Dzib, and several buildings in Chichén Viejo (Old Chichen).\n\n\nIn 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.\n\n\n\n## Site description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of central Chichen Itza\nChichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the site core covering an area of at least 5 square kilometers (1.9 sq mi).[2] Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this.[2] The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.[10]\n\n\nThe site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called *sacbeob*.[nb 4] Archeologists have identified over 80 *sacbeob* criss-crossing the site,[10] and extending in all directions from the city.[38] Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like Gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.[39]\n\n\nThe architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucatán Peninsula.[2] The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of the Temple of Kukulcán (El Castillo), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.\n\n\nSouth of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chichén Viejo (Old Chichén) and only open to archeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.\n\n\n\n### Architectural styles[edit]\n\n\nThe Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in the Akab Dzib structure.[40] The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper façades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.[41]\n\n\nAt least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate façade and masked doorway that are typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centered upon a region in the north of Campeche state, lying between the Puuc and Río Bec regions.[42][43]\n\n\nThose structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site, with the most important being the Las Monjas group.[21]\n\n\n\n### Architectural groups[edit]\n\n\n#### Great North Platform[edit]\n\n\n##### Temple of Kukulcán (El Castillo)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Castillo, Chichen Itza\n\n![](image)\nThe descent of the serpent effect demonstrated at Kukulcán during the night show with artificial lighting\n![](image)\nThe descent of the serpent effect observed at Kukulcán during the 2009 spring equinox\n\nDominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the *Temple of Kukulcán* (a Maya feathered serpent deity similar to the Aztec Quetzalcoatl). The temple was identified by the first Spaniards to see it, as *El Castillo* (\"the castle\"), and it regularly is referred to as such.[44] This step pyramid stands about 30 meters (98 ft) high and consists of a series of nine square terraces, each approximately 2.57 meters (8.4 ft) high, with a 6-meter (20 ft) high temple upon the summit.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Jaguar Throne inside the Temple of Kukulcán (\"El Castillo\") pyramid is red and inlaid with jade\nThe sides of the pyramid are approximately 55.3 meters (181 ft) at the base and rise at an angle of 53°, although that varies slightly for each side.[45] The four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of 45°.[45] The *talud* walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between 72° and 74°.[45] At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent.[46]\n\n\nMesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones,[47] and the Temple of Kukulcán is one such example.[48] In the mid-1930s, the Mexican government sponsored an excavation of the temple. After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid. By digging from the top, they found another temple buried below the current one.[49]\n\n\nInside the temple chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne in the shape of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade.[49] The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.[50]\n\n\nAround the Spring and Autumn equinoxes, in the late afternoon, the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent deity, Kukulcán.[51] It is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, but the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making it impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.[52]\n\n\n\n##### Great Ball Court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Great Ball Court\nArcheologists have identified in Chichen Itza thirteen ballcourts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame,[53] but the Great Ball Court about 150 meters (490 ft) to the north-west of the Castillo is the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica.[44] It measures 168 by 70 meters (551 by 230 ft).[54]\n\n\nThe parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each 95 meters (312 ft) long.[54] The walls of these platforms stand 8 meters (26 ft) high;[54] set high up in the center of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents.[54][nb 5]\n\n\nAt the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players.[44] In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes.[55]\n\n\nAt one end of the Great Ball Court is the **North Temple**, also known as the **Temple of the Bearded Man** (*Templo del Hombre Barbado*).[56] This small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair.[57] At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.\n\n\nBuilt into the east wall are the *Temples of the Jaguar*. The *Upper Temple of the Jaguar* overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two, large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif. Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene.\n\n\nIn the entrance to the *Lower Temple of the Jaguar*, which opens behind the ball court, is another Jaguar throne, similar to the one in the inner temple of El Castillo, except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration. The outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas-relief carvings.\n\n\n\n##### Additional structures[edit]\n\n\nThe *Tzompantli*, or *Skull Platform* (*Plataforma de los Cráneos*), shows the clear cultural influence of the central Mexican Plateau. Unlike the *tzompantli* of the highlands, however, the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at Tenochtitlan.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nChichén Itzá; *tzompantli* or Skull Platform\n\nThe *Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars* (*Plataforma de Águilas y Jaguares*) is immediately to the east of the Great Ballcourt.[56] It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides.[44] The sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts.[44]\n\n\nThis *Platform of Venus* is dedicated to the planet Venus.[44] In its interior archeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone,[44] the purpose of which is unknown. This platform is located north of El Castillo, between it and the Cenote Sagrado.[56]\n\n\nThe *Temple of the Tables* is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of El Castillo. Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called \"atlantes.\"\n\n\nThe *Steam Bath* is a unique building with three parts: a waiting gallery, a water bath, and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones.\n\n\n*Sacbe Number One* is a causeway that leads to the Cenote Sagrado, is the largest and most elaborate at Chichen Itza. This \"white road\" is 270 meters (890 ft) long with an average width of 9 meters (30 ft). It begins at a low wall a few meters from the Platform of Venus. According to archeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road.\n\n\n\n##### Sacred Cenote[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sacred Cenote\n\n![](image)The Sacred Cenote\nThe Yucatán Peninsula is a limestone plain, with no rivers or streams. The region is pockmarked with natural sinkholes, called cenotes, which expose the water table to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Cenote Sagrado, which is 60 meters (200 ft) in diameter[58] and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some 27 meters (89 ft) below.\n\n\nThe Cenote Sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, according to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought.[58] Archeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, obsidian, shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as skeletons of children and men.[58][59]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Temple of the Warriors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTemple of the Warriors (\"Templo de los Guerreros\")\n![](image)\nDetail of the Temple of the Warriors, showing a statue of Chacmool\n\nThe Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading toward the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool.\n\n\nThis temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool. The archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1925 to 1928. A key member of this restoration was Earl H. Morris, who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled *Temple of the Warriors*. Watercolors were made of murals in the Temple of the Warriors that were deteriorating rapidly following exposure to the elements after enduring for centuries in the protected enclosures being discovered. Many depict battle scenes and some even have tantalizing images that lend themselves to speculation and debate by prominent Maya scholars, such as Michael D. Coe and Mary Miller, regarding possible contact with Viking sailors.[60]\n\n\n\n##### Group of a Thousand Columns[edit]\n\n\nAlong the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns, although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: A west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors. A north group runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief;\n\n\nA northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors, contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods, as well as animals and serpents. The northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering, a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some 40 meters (130 ft) away to a rejollada, a former cenote.\n\n\nTo the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings. The **Temple of the Carved Columns** is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a Chac Mool. There are also numerous columns with rich, bas-relief carvings of some 40 personages.\n\n\nA section of the upper façade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure. The **Temple of the Small Tables** which is an unrestored mound. And the **Thompson's Temple** (referred to in some sources as **Palace of Ahau Balam Kauil** ), a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting Jaguars (*balam* in Maya) as well as glyphs of the Maya god Kahuil.\n\n\n\n##### El Mercado[edit]\n\n\nThis square structure anchors the southern end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial.\n\n\n\n#### Osario Group[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Osario pyramid\n![](image)\nThe Osario staircase\n\nSouth of the North Group is a smaller platform that has many important structures, several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at Chichen Itza, Xtoloc.\n\n\n**The Osario** itself, like the Temple of Kukulkan, is a step-pyramid temple dominating its platform, only on a smaller scale. Like its larger neighbor, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but unlike Kukulkan, at the center is an opening into the pyramid that leads to a natural cave 12 meters (39 ft) below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 19th century, and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads, he named the structure **The High Priests' Temple.** Archeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests.\n\n\nThe **Temple of Xtoloc** is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is. It overlooks the other large cenote at Chichen Itza, named after the Maya word for iguana, \"Xtoloc.\" The temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people, as well as representations of plants, birds, and mythological scenes.\n\n\nBetween the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The **Platform of Venus**, which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to Kukulkan (El Castillo), the **Platform of the Tombs**, and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple.\n\n\nSouth of the Osario, at the boundary of the platform, there are two small buildings that archeologists believe were residences for important personages. These have been named as the **House of the Metates** and the **House of the Mestizas**.\n\n\n\n#### Casa Colorada Group[edit]\n\n\nSouth of the Osario Group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the Chichen Itza archeological zone.\n\n\n\n![](image)Chichanchob\nThe **Casa Colorada** (Spanish for \"Red House\") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Significant red paint was still present in the days of the 19th century explorers. Its Maya name is *Chichanchob*, which according to INAH may mean \"small holes\". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza.\n\n\nIn 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.[61]\n\n\nWhile the Casa Colorada is in a good state of preservation, other buildings in the group, with one exception, are decrepit mounds. One building is half standing, named **La Casa del Venado** (House of the Deer). This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.[62]\n\n\n\n#### Central Group[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A small temple bearing many masks in the Las Monjas complex (\"La Iglesia\")\n![](image)The observatory temple (\"El Caracol\")\n**Las Monjas** is one of the more notable structures at Chichen Itza. It is a complex of Terminal Classic buildings constructed in the Puuc architectural style. The Spanish named this complex *Las Monjas* (\"The Nuns\" or \"The Nunnery\"), but it was a governmental palace. Just to the east is a small temple (known as the *La Iglesia*, \"The Church\") decorated with elaborate masks.[44][63]\n\n\nThe Las Monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of Kʼakʼupakal.[21][64]\n\n\n**El Caracol** (\"The Snail\") is located to the north of *Las Monjas*. It is a round building on a large square platform. It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside. The structure, with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape (the others are rectangular, in keeping with Maya practice), is theorized to have been a proto-observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events, specifically around the path of Venus as it traverses the heavens.[65]\n\n\n**Akab Dzib** is located to the east of the Caracol. The name means, in Yucatec Mayan, \"Dark Writing\"; \"dark\" in the sense of \"mysterious\". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is *Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na*, \"the flat house with the excessive number of chambers\", and it was the home of the administrator of Chichén Itzá, kokom Yahawal Choʼ Kʼakʼ.[66]\n\n\nINAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only 6 meters (20 ft) high, and is 50 meters (160 ft) in length and 15 meters (49 ft) wide. The long, western-facing façade has seven doorways. The eastern façade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, dry, cenote.\n\n\nThe southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs—the \"mysterious\" or \"obscure\" writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.\n\n\n\n#### Old Chichen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Temple of 3 Lintels\" in Chichen Viejo group\n**Old Chichen** (or **Chichén Viejo** in Spanish) is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated.[2] It includes the Initial Series Group, the Phallic Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys.\n\n\nThis section of the site has been closed to tourism for years while archaeological excavations and restorations were ongoing, and is planned to reopen to visitors in 2024.[67]\n\n\n\n#### Other structures[edit]\n\n\nChichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about 5 square kilometers (1.9 sq mi) and several outlying subsidiary sites.\n\n\n\n#### Caves of Balankanche[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Composite laser scan image of Chichen Itza's Cave of Balankanche, showing how the shape of its great limestone column is strongly evocative of the World Tree in Maya mythological belief systems, data from a National Science Foundation/CyArk research partnership\nApproximately 4 km (2.5 mi) south east of the Chichen Itza archeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as Balankanche (Spanish: *Gruta de Balankanche*), **Balamkaʼancheʼ** in Yucatec Maya). In the caves, a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre-Columbian times.\n\n\nThe location of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and Alfred Tozzer visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. Edwin Shook and R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the Carnegie Institution in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era.[68]\n\n\nOn 15 September 1959, José Humberto Gómez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved censers, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them *in situ*.[69]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1938 painting of one of the reliefs found on lower terrace columns of the Temple of the Warriors, by Octavio Medellin\nChichen Itza is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico; in 2017 it was estimated to have received 2.1 million visitors.[70]\n\n\nTourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucatán in the public's imagination with his book *Incidents of Travel in Yucatan*, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chichén Itzá. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented daguerreotype.[71]\n\n\nAfter Edward Thompson in 1894 purchased the Hacienda Chichén, which included Chichen Itza, he received a constant stream of visitors. In 1910 he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property, but abandoned those plans, probably because of the Mexican Revolution.\n\n\nIn the early 1920s, a group of Yucatecans, led by writer/photographer Francisco Gomez Rul, began working toward expanding tourism to Yucatán. They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza. Gomez Rul published one of the first guidebooks to Yucatán and the ruins.\n\n\nGomez Rul's son-in-law, Fernando Barbachano Peon (a grandnephew of former Yucatán Governor Miguel Barbachano), started Yucatán's first official tourism business in the early 1920s. He began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at Progreso, the port north of Mérida, and persuading them to spend a week in Yucatán, after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination. In his first year Barbachano Peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour. In the mid-1920s Barbachano Peon persuaded Edward Thompson to sell 5 acres (20,000 m2) next to Chichen for a hotel. In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chichén, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution.[72]\n\n\nIn 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chichén, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson.[37] Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chichén, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel.\n\n\nIn 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicas, Artísticas e Históricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership.[73] There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Cancún resort area to the east.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulcán during which the feathered serpent appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid.[nb 6] Tour guides will also demonstrate a unique the acoustical effect at Chichen Itza: a handclap before the staircase of the El Castillo pyramid will produce by an echo that resembles the chirp of a bird, similar to that of the quetzal as investigated by Declercq.[74]\n\n\nChichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the second-most visited of Mexico's archeological sites.[75] The archeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Cancún, who make a day trip on tour buses.\n\n\nIn 2007, Chichen Itza's Temple of Kukulcán (El Castillo) was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World after a worldwide vote.[76] Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who projected that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists to Chichen would double by 2012.[nb 7][77] The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucatán purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano.[78]\n\n\nINAH, which manages the site, has closed a number of monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.[50]\n\n\n\n## Photograph gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![El Caracol, observatory of Chichen Itza](image)\n\nEl Caracol, observatory of Chichen Itza\n* ![Temple of the Warriors in 1986 - note that the Temple of the Big Tables, immediately to the left, was unrestored at that time](image)\n\nTemple of the Warriors in 1986 - note that the Temple of the Big Tables, immediately to the left, was unrestored at that time\n* ![Stone Ring located 9 m (30 ft) above the floor of the Great Ballcourt](image)\n\nStone Ring located 9 m (30 ft) above the floor of the Great Ballcourt\n* ![Platform of Venus in the Great Plaza](image)\n\nPlatform of Venus in the Great Plaza\n* ![Kukulcán pyramid](image)\n\nKukulcán pyramid\n* ![Mosaic mask on the western face of La Iglesia](image)\n\nMosaic mask on the western face of *La Iglesia*\n* ![Elaborate mosaic masks](image)\n\nElaborate mosaic masks\n* ![A feathered serpent sculpture at the base of one of the stairways of Kukulcán (El Castillo)](image)\n\nA feathered serpent sculpture at the base of one of the stairways of Kukulcán (El Castillo)\n* ![Las Monjas (Chichen Itza) in 1843 by Frederick Catherwood.[79]](image)\n\nLas Monjas (Chichen Itza) in 1843 by Frederick Catherwood.[79]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Indigenous peoples of the Americas portal\n* ![](image)Mesoamerica portal\n\n\n* Asteroid 100456 Chichen Itza\n* List of archeoastronomical sites sorted by country\n* List of Mesoamerican pyramids\n* Maya–Toltec controversy at Chichen Itza\n* Tikal\n* Uxmal\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** /tʃiːˈtʃɛn iːˈtsɑː/ *chee-CHEN eet-SAH*, Spanish: *Chichén Itzá* [tʃiˈtʃen iˈtsa], often with the emphasis reversed in English to /ˈtʃiːtʃɛn ˈiːtsə/ *CHEE-chen EET-sə*; from Yucatec Maya: *Chiʼchʼèen Ìitshaʼ* [tɕʰiʔtɕʼèːn ìːtsʰaʔ] (Barrera Vásquez 1980) \"at the mouth of the well of the Itza people\"\n2. **^** Concerning the legal basis of the ownership of Chichen and other sites of patrimony, see Breglia (2006), in particular Chapter 3, \"Chichen Itza, a Century of Privatization\".

It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *tāj mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*tāj*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. This place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.[19]\n\n\n\nShah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal\n* ![\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution](image)\n\n\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution\n* ![Artistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal](image)\n\nArtistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal\n\n## Architecture and design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal\n\nAnimation showing the Taj Mahal (English subtitles)\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the *Baby Taj*), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tomb[edit]\n\n\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an *iwan* (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[22]\n\n\nThe base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge *pishtaq* or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked *pishtaqs* is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.[23]\n\n\n\nTaj Mahal gallery\n* ![The main gateway (darwaza) to the Taj Mahal](image)\n\nThe main gateway (darwaza) to the Taj Mahal\n* ![Taj Mahal minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal minaret\n* ![Taj Mahal at sunrise from Main Entrance](image)\n\nTaj Mahal at sunrise from Main Entrance\n* ![Sketch of the interior view of the vaulted dome over the tombs of Shah Jahan (left) and Mumtaz Mahal (right)](image)\n\nSketch of the interior view of the vaulted dome over the tombs of Shah Jahan (left) and Mumtaz Mahal (right)\n* ![The false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber](image)\n\nThe false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber\n* ![The actual tombs of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the lower level.

The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or *amrud* (guava dome).[24] The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed *chattris* (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical.[25] Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (*guldastas*) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the *chattris* and *guldastas*. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.[26]\n\n\nThe main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[27] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.[28]\n\n\nThe minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets – a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.[29]\n\n\n\n### Exterior decorations[edit]\n\n\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.[30][31]\n\n\nThe calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\"[31] The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity\".[32] Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi\".[33] Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble[32] inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAbstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex [*citation needed*] array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.[34]\n\n\nOn the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.[32]\n\n\n\nDetailed exterior design\n* ![Taj Mahal Exterior with a minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal Exterior with a minaret\n* ![Detail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall](image)\n\nDetail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall\n* ![Base, dome and minaret](image)\n\nBase, dome and minaret\n* ![Finial, tamga of the Mughal Empire](image)\n\nFinial, tamga of the Mughal Empire\n* ![Plant motifs](image)\n\nPlant motifs\n* ![Reflective tiles](image)\n\nReflective tiles\n* ![Marble jali (latticed grill)](image)\n\nMarble jali (latticed grill)\n* ![Calligraphy of Arabic Ayaat](image)\n\nCalligraphy of Arabic Ayaat\n\n### Interior decoration[edit]\n\n\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[35] The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[36] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or *jali* a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or *jali* bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.[37]\n\n\n\nDetailed interior design\n* ![Flowers carved in marble](image)\n\nFlowers carved in marble\n* ![Detail of pietra dura jali inlay](image)\n\nDetail of *pietra dura* *jali* inlay\n* ![Delicacy of intricate pierce work](image)\n\nDelicacy of intricate pierce work\n* ![Archways in the mosque](image)\n\nArchways in the mosque\n* ![Incised painting](image)\n\nIncised painting\n* ![Finial floor tiling](image)\n\nFinial floor tiling\n* ![Detail of jali](image)\n\nDetail of *jali*\n* ![Pietra dura, or parchin kari, flowers](image)\n\n*Pietra dura*, or *parchin kari*, flowers\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.[36]\n\n\nThe pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include: *O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious...* . The Tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads: *He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri*.[38]\n\n\n\n### Garden[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walkways beside reflecting pool\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square *charbagh* or Mughal garden.\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called *al Hawd al-Kawthar* in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.[39]\n\n\nElsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labelled according to common and scientific names[40] and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian *paridaeza*, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)South-eastern view with lawn\nMost Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise.[41] Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan.[42] Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees.[43] As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India,[44] and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[45]\n\n\n\n### Outlying buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[*citation needed*] These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed *chattris*, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House, which is now used as a museum.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe main gateway (*darwaza*) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its *pishtaq* arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. It uses bas-relief and pietra dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the *jawab* (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the *jawab's* lack of a *mihrab* (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the *Masjid-i Jahān-Numā*, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTaj Mahal and outlying buildings as seen from across the Yamuna River (northern view)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were used.[48] The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.[50] A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of 20 or 30 oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.[51] An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of *purs*, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[16] while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about ₹ 32 million,[16] which is around ₹ 52.8 billion ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.[52]\n\n\n\n## Symbolism[edit]\n\n\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[53]\n\n\nAlong with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.[54] Bilateral symmetry dominated by a central axis has been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal.[55] Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north–south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.[56]\n\n\nThe planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal's mansion in the garden of Paradise.[55] The concept of Gardens of Paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. Colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior, and are filled in with semi-precious stones using a technique called pietra dura, or as the Mughals called it, *parchin kari*.[57] The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.[58]\n\n\nAccording to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound of the Taj symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan has been split into two – one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. According to the world-traveler Eleanor Roosevelt, the white symbolised the purity of real love.[59] Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.\n\n\nThe Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.[60]\n\n\n\n## Later days[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[61] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal. They took away the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph; they also took the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoilation.[62]\n\n\nBy the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[63] He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time, the garden was remodelled with European-style lawns that are still in place today.[64]\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protective wartime scaffolding in 1942\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.[65][66] During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.[67]\n\n\nMore recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain[68] due to the Mathura Oil Refinery,[69] which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives.[70] The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown.[71][72] To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.[73]\n\n\nConcerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.[74]\n\n\nSmall minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on 11 April 2018.[75] On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.[76]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visitors at Taj Mahal\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[77] which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014.[78] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2022[update], the fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ₹540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ₹1,100.[79] Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.[80][81] In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.[82]\n\n\nThe small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[83] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.[84]\n\n\nThe grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 hours on weekdays, except on Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00 hours. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after,[85] excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\n\n\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George Harrison, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Philip.[86][87][88][89]\n\n\n\n## Myths[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, one of the first European writers about the Taj Mahal\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument.[90] A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river.[14] The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black.[91] A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[92]\n\n\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[93][94] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\nAnother myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[97]\n\n\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who claimed that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmal Dev in 1196.[100]\n\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\nEastern view in the morning\n* ![Taj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration](image)\n\nTaj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration\n* ![Western view at sunset](image)\n\nWestern view at sunset\n* ![Taj Mahal through the fog](image)\n\nTaj Mahal through the fog\n* ![A panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005](image)\n\nA panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![](image)Islam portal\n* ![icon](image)Architecture portal\n\n\n* Architecture of India\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\n* Fatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\n* Islamic architecture\n* Indo-Islamic architecture\n* *Inside*, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n* List of tallest domes\n* List of tallest structures built before the 20th century\n* New 7 Wonders of the World\n* Taj Mahal replicas and derivatives\n* Wonders of the World\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Taj Mahal\". *UNESCO Culture World Heritage Centre, World Heritage List*.
