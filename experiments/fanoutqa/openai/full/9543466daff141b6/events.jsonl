These include colour cosmetics, like foundation and mascara, skincare such as moisturisers and cleansers, haircare such as shampoos, conditioners and hair colours, and toiletries such as bubble bath and soap. The manufacturing industry is dominated by a small number of multinational corporations that originated in the early 20th century, but the distribution and sale of cosmetics is spread among a wide range of different businesses.Cosmetics must be safe when customers use them in accordance with the label's instructions or in the conventional or expected manner. One measure a producer may take to guarantee the safety of a cosmetic product is product testing. FDA occasionally does testing as part of its research program or when looking into potential safety issues with a product. Both the cosmetics business and consumers can benefit from the FDA's resources on product testing. \n\n\nThe largest cosmetic companies are L'Oreal, Estée Lauder, Coty, Nivea, Shiseido and Chanel.[1] The market volume of the cosmetics industry in Europe and the United States is about EUR €70 billion per year, according to a 2005 publication.[2] The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf – May 2007). Europe is the leading market, representing approximately €63 billion[*as of?*].\n\n\n\n\n## By region[edit]\n\n\n### Americas[edit]\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nWithin the United States, the state of California has the largest concentration of beauty establishments in America at 25.5%, followed by New Jersey at 8.1% of American beauty establishments.[3] Since 2016, the number of cosmetic stores rises between 3 and 4% each year and employment in this division is rising each year 13-16%.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nCalifornia has the largest concentration due to social media marketing from celebrities and ‘beauty gurus’. For example, Kylie Jenner's company Kylie Cosmetics, is valued at $800 million and sold an estimated $330 million worth of makeup in 2017. YouTube and social media influencers Jeffree Star (Jeffree Star Cosmetics), and Michelle Phan (Ipsy), and pop-star Rihanna with her Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics, have also contributed to California's rising popularity in the beauty industry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBecause the US dollar is so valuable to other countries around the world, it has become extremely expensive for most countries to import American beauty products and to export their own products to America. However, there are a few countries with beauty products that are in popular demand in America due to their quality and value including France, Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nAs of 2018, “These four countries account for 45.2% of all industry imports as domestic consumers demand luxury products”.[3] South Korean and Japanese skincare products which are designed to be more gentle and innovative, are also becoming more popularized in the United States due to their quality and affordability. The U.S. has held the same regulation over this industry since 1938 under the FD&C Act, which has gained additional amendments over time.[4]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\nCanada is a big influencer in the American beauty industry due to its proximity to the United States and because it falls under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement “eliminates most tariffs on products traded between Canada, Mexico, and the United States,\"[5] and allows Canada to trade superfluously. Canada accounts for an estimated 13.6% of imports and 19.9% of cosmetic exports in 2018.[3] [*citation needed*]Because Mexico also benefits from the NAFTA trade agreement, they represent another top cosmetic importer and exporter for lower-priced beauty products which are manufactured in mass and sold in large drug store chains in America.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\n#### France[edit]\n\n\nCosmetic sales in France reached €6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (Fédération des Industries de la Parfumerie – the French federation for the perfume industry).[6] France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role, both nationally and internationally. Most products with a label, \"Made in France\" are valued on the international market. According to data from 2008, the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40 consecutive years. Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, Yves Saint Laurent, Yves Rocher, Bioderma and L'Oreal. L'Oreal is known for its mass production of hair and makeup products which are produced in mass and sold in drug stores in America as well as internationally. L'Oreal has gained popularity especially due to its app Makeup Genius which allows users to try on makeup using their phone camera in addition to working with Los Angeles-based NYX Cosmetics and Estee Lauder's MAC Cosmetics, L'Oreal is one of the leading cosmetic brands in the United States. According to the company's latest financial report of 2017, North America accounted for 13.6% of the company's global cosmetic sales.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cosmetics at Life Pharmacy at Westfield Albany on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand\n#### Germany[edit]\n\n\nIn Germany, the cosmetic industry generated €12.6 billion of retail sales in 2008,[7] which, at the time, made the German cosmetic industry the third largest in the world after Japan and the United States. It has been shown that Germany's cosmetic industry grew nearly 5 percent in one year, from 2007 to 2008. German exports in this industry reached €5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of cosmetics totaled €3 billion.[7] Germany gains most of its imported cosmetics from France, Switzerland, the United States and Italy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Made in Italy\n\n#### Belarus[edit]\n\n\nThe Belarusian cosmetics market consists of Belarusian companies. There are more than 20 cosmetic companies in Belarus - Belita, Vitex, Lux Visage, Mastige, Modum, Rekish Cosmetics. The volume of the cosmetic market is more than 300 million euros per year.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cosmetics in South Korea\n\nThe cosmetic industry in Asia is mainly dominated by regional cosmetic brands. Shiseido Co. LTD, A popular cosmetic brand based in Japan, has 82.1% of its sales in Asia.[8] No other Western company in the top 10 match these kinds of regional sales. Furthermore, geographic dispersion of sales by Asian cosmetic companies in Asia accounted for 92.42% of sales, while geographic dispersion of assets of Asian cosmetic companies in Asia was 87.05%.[8] Western cosmetic companies often have failed to gain footholds in various countries. For example, in Japan, many advertisement campaigns that find success in the West, such as celebrity appearances and references to science, did not sway a sample group of respondents to purchase the foreign brands.[9] However, despite the lack of Western cosmetic presence, the growing trend of “fair skin”, or whiting one's skin, can expose consumers skin to harmful chemicals when using “fairness creams”.[10]\n\n\nDue to recent significant economic growth in many Asian markets, regulation pertaining to chemicals in cosmetic products has been lacking. SK-II, a cosmetic product owned by P&G, was found to contain banned heavy metals in China in 2006.[11] Another study found that women who had recently moved to Vancouver, Canada from East and South Asia had higher levels of lead in their blood than South and East Asian immigrants who had been living in Canada for longer.[12] One of sources of lead was determined to be some facial powders marketed in various regions of Asia.[13]\n\n\n\n## Fashion designer collaboration[edit]\n\n\nDue to the popularity of cosmetics, especially fragrances and perfumes, many designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up with different perfumes carrying their names. Moreover, some actors and singers have their own perfume line (such as Celine Dion). Designer perfumes are, like any other designer products, the most expensive in the industry as the consumer pays not only for the product but also for the brand.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe cosmetic industry worldwide seems to be continuously developing, now more than ever with the advent of the Internet companies. Many famous companies sell their cosmetic products online also, in countries in which they do not have representatives.\n\n\nResearch on the email marketing of cosmetics to consumers suggests they are goal-oriented with email content that is seen as useful, motivating recipients to visit a store to test the cosmetics or talk to sales representatives. Useful content included special sales offerings and new product information rather than information about makeup trends.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Colorism[edit]\n\n\nMany companies advertise white or light skin as not only a cosmetic change, but a lifestyle change. White beauty implies a lifestyle of “sophistication, beauty, power, and wealth.” Mass advertising and marketing from the US and Europe, as well as multiple mass media forms are used to reach other cultures to influence their purchasing habits. Many of the skin lightening products sold usually have celebrity endorsements, further increasing sales and the desire for lighter skin. These products can cause serious damage to skin and pose a health risk to the consumer.[15]\n\n\nIn a study done by S. S. Agrawal and Pallavi Sharma on eleven skin lightening products sold in India, it was found that “mercury was detected in all the samples of the skin lightening creams in the range of 0.14–0.36 ppm.” This study also observed that none of the brands tested include mercury as an ingredient on the packaging, which may mislead consumers regarding health risks. In a report by the World Health Organization, it was stated that “skin whitening products can cause leukemia, liver and kidney cancer and could also result in severe skin conditions.”[16] Though these health risks exist, women of color in many parts of the world are purchasing skin lightening creams.\n\n\nChoma and Prusaczyk's survey of women of color in the US and India “show[s] that chronic surveillance of skin tone predicts skin tone dissatisfaction and skin bleaching.” Some companies in the cosmetic industry have capitalized off of the cultural pressure and standards for having lighter skin.  This study concluded that “skin bleaching is not merely a physical or aesthetic change, but one with potentially wide-ranging implications on psychological well-being and, more broadly, the perpetuation of racist ideologies and beauty standards.”[17]\n\n\n\n### Impact on environment[edit]\n\n\nSome components found in cosmetics, as well as their production, have been found to have negative environmental impact.[18][19][20][21] For example, Palm oil is found in lipstick, and shampoo. Palm oil is connected to the destruction of forests and habitats of endangered species, including orangutans, tigers, elephants, and rhinos.[22][23]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Testing cosmetics on animals and Cruelty-free cosmetics\n\nAnimal testing has been a large controversy in the cosmetic industry. Animal tests performed include the Draize eye irritancy test, where test chemicals are applied to rabbits’ eyes and left on for several days,[24] and toxicity tests such as LD50, where a substance's toxicity is tested by determining the concentration at which it will kill 50% of the test animals.[25]\n\n\nDue to public outcry as well as financial and temporal considerations, animal testing in cosmetics has steadily been decreasing over time and replaced with non-animal tests.[26] One of these non-animal tests is the Environmental Protection Agency’s ToxCast which has a similar accuracy compared to animal tests but achieves results with fewer economic costs and less time.[26]\n\n\nAn EU ban of marketing cosmetic products which have been tested on animals became effective in 2013.[27] There are a few exceptions to this law. Animal testing data for cosmetics can be used if the data for the ingredient used in the cosmetic originated from testing for non-cosmetic products.[27] Secondly, if a country outside of the EU requires animal testing and the cosmetic product was tested in that country, the ban also does not apply.[27] Cosmetic tests on animals are still legal in several countries, such as the US, Japan, Russia,[26] and China.\n\n\nThere are a number of cosmetics companies that claim they are “cruelty-free,” such as Bath & Body Works, Aveda, ELF, and Milani,[28] but some argue that because the label of “cruelty-free” both lacks regulation and standardized third-party certification, it has little real weight.[24] Brands that claim to be cruelty free often advertize this with a logo of a rabbit on their products.\n\n\nIn some cases, cosmetic testing is done on humans, which also leads to a related discussion of best practices and ethics.[29]\n\n\n\n## Labor rights and body politics[edit]\n\n\nA number of studies have focused on social issues such as labor rights and sociology of the body.[30][31][32] Research has found that some retail stores have discriminatory hiring practices and prefer to hire class-privileged workers to promote their upscale image.[31]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Animal–industrial complex\n* Beauty salon\n* Beauty store\n* Cosmetics policy\n* Wildlife smuggling\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Top 10 Cosmetic Companies in the World: The List\". *American Cosmetic Association*. 2023.

Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to Parisian hairdressers.[5][6] On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company,[7] the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the team continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.[8]\n\n\nSchueller provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at L'Oréal headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group whose leader formed a political party Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement), which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.[9] L'Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after World War II, such as Jacques Corrèze, who served as CEO of the United States operation.[10][11]\n\n\nL'Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Oréal currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.[5][6]\n\n\n\n### Recent History[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Liliane Bettencourt the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, passed away and left the business to her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers.[5]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nIn 1988–89, L'Oréal controlled the film company Paravisión, whose properties included the Filmation and De Laurentiis libraries. StudioCanal acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nL'Oréal currently owns 36 brands and continues to grow. As of October 4, 2021, the company registered 497 patents.[12]\n\n\nL'Oréal purchased Synthélabo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synthélabo merged with Sanofi in 1999 to become Sanofi-Synthélabo. Sanofi-Synthélabo merged with Aventis in 2004 to become Sanofi-Aventis.[13]\n\n\nOn 17 March 2006, L'Oréal purchased cosmetics company The Body Shop for £562 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn May 2008, L'Oréal acquired YSL Beauté for $1.8 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2014, L'Oréal finalized the acquisition of major Chinese beauty brand Magic Holdings for $840 million.[15]\n\n\nIn February 2014, L'Oréal agreed to buy back 8% of its shares for €3.4bn from Nestlé. As a result, Nestlé's stake in L'Oréal was reduced from 29.4% to 23.29%, while the Bettencourt Meyers family's stake increased from 30.6% to 33.2%. Nestlé has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974, when it bought into the company at the request of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, who was trying to prevent French state intervention.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decléor brands to L'Oréal for €227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).[16]\n\n\nIn June 2014, L'Oréal agreed to acquire NYX Cosmetics for an undisclosed price, bolstering its makeup offerings in North America, where its consumer-products unit has faltered.[17]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Oréal announced it had agreed to purchase Brazilian hair care company Niely Cosmeticos Group for an undisclosed amount.[18]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Oréal acquired the multi-cultural brand Carol's Daughter.[19]\n\n\nIn July 2016, L'Oréal agreed to acquire IT Cosmetics for $1.2 billion.[20]\n\n\nIn March 2018, L'Oréal acquired the beauty augmented reality company ModiFace.[21]\n\n\nIn May 2018, L'Oréal announced a new beauty and fragrance partnership with Valentino.[22]\n\n\nIn December 2020, L'Oréal announced signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Takami Co, a Japanese company that markets the a premium skincare brand Takami, particularly famous for its iconic product, the Skin Peel pre-serum.[23]\n\n\nIn December 2021, L'Oréal announced the acquisition of the vegan skincare brand Youth to the People.[24][25]\n\n\nIn April 2023, L'Oréal purchased Australian luxury cosmetics brand Aesop for US$2.53 billion.[26][27][28] In August 2023, it was announced the acquisition had been completed.[29]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn Kosovo, during the growth years of the mail-order business, L'Oréal and 3 Suisses founded Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté for mail-order sales of cosmetic products, with brands including Agnès b., Commence and Professeur Christine Poelman among others. In March 2008, L'Oréal acquired 3 Suisse's stake, taking sole control of the company.[30] In November 2013, L'Oréal announced that Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté would cease activity in the first half of 2014.[31]\n\n\nSince 1997, L'Oréal has been an official partner of The Cannes Film Festival.[32] In the years of L'Oréal sponsorship, many L'Oréal ambassadors walked the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival. In 2017, L'Oréal beauty ambassadors, including Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Andie MacDowell, and Eva Longoria, were responsible for the film selection for the outdoor cinema during the Cannes Film Festival.[33]\n\n\nL'Oréal's advertising slogan, \"Because I'm worth it\", was created by a 23-year-old English art director and introduced in 1973 by the model and actress Joanne Dusseau.[34] In the mid-2000s, this was replaced by \"Because you're worth it\". In late-2009, the slogan was changed again to \"Because we're worth it\".\n\n\nIn November 2012, L'Oréal inaugurated the largest factory in the Jababeka Industrial Park, Cikarang, Indonesia, with a total investment of US$100 million.[35] The production will be absorbed 25 percent by the domestic market and the rest will be exported. In 2010, significant growth occurred in Indonesia with a 61 percent increase of unit sales or 28 percent of net sales.[36]\n\n\nIn November 2020, chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet reported in a video conference of the growing importance of e-commerce for the company, remarking that e-commerce makes 24% of their turnover in the third quarter of the year. Rochet stated as well that this 24% of the turnover \"made it possible to offset 50% of the losses due to the closing of physical stores this year\".[37]\n\n\nIn 2023, the L'Oréal Foundation and UNESCO presented a medal of honor and a financial endowment to three women researchers who had to leave their countries, and whose courage, resilience and commitment to science are considered inspriing.[38][39][40]\n\n\n\n## List of spokespeople[edit]\n\n\nL'Oréal Paris has a group of ambassadors, artists, actresses, and activists referred to as the L'Oréal Paris \"Dream Team\".[41]\n\n\n\n* Laetitia Casta (1998–present)[42]\n* Eva Longoria (2005–present)[43]\n* Aishwarya Rai (2004–present)\n* Helen Mirren (2014–present)[44][45]\n* Luma Grothe (2015–present)[46]\n* Soo Joo (2015–present)[47]\n* Aja Naomi King (2017–present)[48]\n* Camilla Cabello (2017–present)[49]\n* Elle Fanning (2017–present)[50]\n* Amber Heard (2018–present)[51]\n* Andie MacDowell (2018–present)[52]\n* Duckie Thot (2018–present)[53]\n* Jaha Dukureh (2018–present)[3][7]\n* Céline Dion (2019–present)[54]\n* Cindy Bruna (2020–present)[55]\n* Katherine Langford (2020–present)[56]\n* Viola Davis (2021–present)[57]\n* Kate Winslet (2021–present)[58]\n* Yseult (2021–present)[59][60]\n* H.E.R.

The world's largest hair salon is located inside the head office building. As of 2005, 90 hairdressers served 300 women, including retirees, students, and unemployed people, per day; the customers are used as test subjects for new hair colours.[74]\n\n\nInternational units include:\n\n\n\n* L'Oréal USA, changed from **Cosmair** in 2000[75] - has its headquarters in New York City, and is responsible for operations in the Americas.[76]\n* L'Oréal Canada Incorporated - Canadian operations, based in Montreal\n* L'Oréal Australia - head office is in Melbourne\n* L'Oréal Nordic - head office is in Copenhagen, Denmark\n* L'ORÉAL Deutschland GmbH - legal seat is in Karlsruhe, head office is in Düsseldorf[77]\n\n\n### Research and development facilities[edit]\n\n\nL'Oréal has 21 worldwide research and development centers: three global centers in France: Aulnay, Chevilly and Saint-Ouen.

According to *Marketing Week*, L'Oréal's pledges included \"aiming for 100 per cent of its products to have an environmental or social benefit; reducing the company's environmental footprint by 60 per cent; empowering “every L’Oréal consumer to make sustainable consumption choices while enhancing the beauty of the planet”; and giving L’Oréal employees access to healthcare, social protection and training wherever they are in the world.\"[85]\n\n\nIn 2021, L'Oréal launches a new sustainability plan \"L'Oréal for the future\"[86] which contains a series of goals to achieve within 2030 on topics such as biodiversity, resource management, climate change and circularity.\n\n\n\n#### Sustainable development[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, L'Oréal declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015[87] – a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.[88] In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 24% reduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by Climate Counts for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.[89]\nIn 2014, L'Oréal made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.[90] The group was included in the Corporate Knights \"Global 100\" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.[90] In March 2023, L'Oréal announced its investment in Genomatica (Geno), a biotechnology company, to develop and manufacture 'biotechnology-based alternatives' to critical constituents in the formulation of 'cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products'.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Position on animal testing[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, L'Oréal has invested €900 million in researching alternatives to animal testing for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, such as the Episkin model[93] at their research centres in Gerland, France, and Pudong, China.[94]\n\n\nNevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,[95] where it is difficult to sell a beauty product without animal testing.[96] Cosmetics by brands such as The Body Shop, which refuse to do animal testing, are thus not sold in China.\n\n\nIn 2013, L'Oréal was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Promoting new methods for plastic recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, L'Oreal announced a cooperation with French biochemistry pioneer Carbios, aiming to establish a method of dissolving plastic waste by using enzymes.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Ukraine war[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, L’Oréal Paris donated €1 million ($1.09 million) to charities supporting refugees from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[100][101] L’Oréal Paris also suspended all commercial activity in Russia, both retail and wholesale.[102][100] The company also supplies hygiene products to hospitals, maternity homes, centers with forcibly displaced persons, homes for the elderly, the military, etc.[103] L’Oréal Paris financially support employees in Ukraine, guaranteeing the payment of wages and providing additional financial assistance, and provide accommodation for employees who are abroad and assist with temporary employment in other L'Oréal branches.[104]\n\n\n\n### Community involvement and awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[105]\n\n\nIn 2008, L'Oréal was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,[106] a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.\n\n\nThe L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.\n\n\nThe awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and carry a grant of US$100,000 for each laureate.\n\n\nThe same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Oréal International Fellowships, providing up to US$40,000 in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.[107]\n\n\nL'Oréal organises the yearly L'Oréal Brandstorm, a business game for students in 46 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, the second prize of $5,000 and the third prize of $2500.\n\n\nL'Oréal is also a founding member of the \"Look Good ... Feel Better\" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.\n\n\nL'Oréal also holds a global competition known as \"L'Oréal Brandstorm\" each year to invite students from around the world to be creative, innovative, and build their own business plans based around different topics (for example: Brandstorm 2019 was about sustainability).\n\n\nIn 2015, Standard Ethics Aei gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[108]\n\n\n\n## Research and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Episkin[edit]\n\n\nEpiskin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Oréal France to provide an alternative to animal testing.[109] Human skin cells leftover from breast surgery[109] are developed under in vitro laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.[110] This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colors, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.[110]\nIn 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading tissue engineering company.[111]\n\n\nThe aim for L'Oréal is to produce products that cater to their diverse customers specifically, in the emerging markets that currently account for 53% of the entire global beauty market.[112] Through these research methods L'Oréal aims to tap into one billion new consumers[112] in these markets for the upcoming years.\n\n\nIn 2003, the L'Oréal Institute for Ethnic Hair & Skin Research was inaugurated in Chicago to continue their research on African American hair and skin among other ethnicities.[113] The L'Oréal Group opened *the Predictive Evaluation Center* in Lyon, France in 2011. This center is devoted to evaluating the quality of the products without testing on animals.[114] Additionally, L'Oréal built an international \"Consumer Insights\" division as well as, regional Research and Innovation centres in six countries: Japan, China, India, the United States, Brazil, and France.[115] The aim of these centres is to collect information on their diverse consumers in order to develop products according to their various needs. In 2011, L'Oréal announced its intention to build a *Research and Innovation Center* in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Estimated at 30 million euros (70 million reais), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.[116]\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Global Hair Research Centre, a facility in Paris Saint-Ouen, opened in March 2012. It serves as the headquarters for the international departments of hair color, hair care, and hairstyling. One of the largest investments in company R&I history, the 25,000m² Centre hosts 500 employees. These include chemists, physical-chemists, opticians, materials scientists, metrologists, rheologists, computer scientists, and statisticians. The facility offers automation, modelling, and sensory evaluation.[117]\n\n\n\n### Human skin 3D printing[edit]\n\n\nL'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup Organovo to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. \"We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with\", said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.[118]\n\n\n\n### Modiface[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 March 2018, L'Oréal announced that it had acquired Modiface, a beauty tech company that uses augmented reality to allow users to digitally try on different makeup products and hairstyles.[119] Later in 2020, L'Oréal Paris introduced their first line of virtual makeup for social media platforms called \"Signature Faces\", an augmented reality filter for Instagram, Snapchat, Snap Camera, and Google Duo. It was in part marketed as a way to engage consumers spending more time online due to the pandemic, as well as a way for consumers to try on makeup at home for online shopping.[120]\n\n\n\n### Perso[edit]\n\n\nThis smart device creates custom formulas for lipstick, foundation, and skin care.[121] Customers can use it through the Perso app, which uses AI technology, and is expected to get launched in 2021.[122]\n\n\n\n### Hapta[edit]\n\n\nAt CES 2023, L'Oréal introduced its newly developed innovation, Hapta.[123][124] This product, Hapta, consists of a 'computerized makeup applicator' which is devoted to people with limited hand and arm mobility.[123] Indeed, it facilitates for them the process of applying lipstick.[125] This new applicator would able to 'mimic' different movements of a beauty routine through 'customizable accessories'.[126] The motive behind this innovation is to meet the beauty needs of people with limited hand and arm mobility.[123] According to L'Oréal, Hapta is expected to be launched by Lancôme in 2023.[126]\n\n\n\n### L'Oréal brow magic[edit]\n\n\nAnother innovation by L'Oréal was announced at CES 2023 which is L'Oreal Brow Magic.[123] This innovation is considered to be the 'first at-home' electronic applicator to facilitate eyebrow-makeup.[123] In fact, it offers its users with immediate special and 'bespoke' brows.[123]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### Involvement in conflicts[edit]\n\n\nEugène Schueller, the company's founder, was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer.[127] L'Oréal concedes that Schueller was an antisemitic fascist.[128] He was also a member of La Cagoule, which supported the Vichy regime, and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organisation. Eugène bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of La Cagoule were held at L'Oréal headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.[129][130]\n\n\nOther controversy arose when Jean Frydman, a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Oréal, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Oréal wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Oréal executives. André Bettencourt who married Schueller's daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, and became deputy chairman for L'Oréal, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Française. La Terre Française was an antisemitic Nazi propaganda sheet. André has admitted ownership of the propaganda but claimed he was poisoned by the Vichy regime and said, \"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them.\"[129] André Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the French Resistance after Liberation.[130] It was also revealed that Eugène Schueller hired Jacques Correze, who was the honorary head of L'Oréal's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with La Cagoule.[128]\n\n\nFurther controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Oréal had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during World War II. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a Holocaust survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Oréal, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Oréal, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as *L'Oréal a pris ma maison* and in English as *L'Oréal stole my house!*, details how L'Oréal took over the Waitzfelder home in the German city of Karlsruhe (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.[131] Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, \"All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Oréal should be any different from the others.\" A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial. As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the European Court of Human Rights.[130][131]\n\n\nOn 31 July 2014 during Operation Protective Edge launched by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Gaza Strip, the Israel advocacy organisation StandWithUs posted several Facebook photos of care packages, which they said were donated by Garnier Israel to female IDF soldiers.[132][133][134] This sparked several calls to boycott Garnier and L'Oréal worldwide.[135] As of 13 June 2024 no official statement was made by Garnier or L'Oréal regarding the donation.\n\n\nOn March 4, 2022, L'Oréal announced €1 million donation for relief support of Ukrainians who suffer from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[136]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nL'Oréal began *in vitro* tissue testing in 1979, and does not test any of its products or ingredients on animals anywhere in the world since 1989–14 years before it was required by regulation.[137] Controversy came from the fact that L'Oréal sells products in China, whose regulators conduct animal testing on cosmetics to be sold within its territory. Even though a ban on animal testing in China came into effect in January 2020, Chinese authorities still perform this practice for imported \"ordinary\" cosmetics.[138][139]\n\n\nFollowing L'Oréal's 2006 purchase of The Body Shop, which does not support animal testing, The Body Shop's founder Anita Roddick was forced to defend herself against allegations of \"abandoning her principles\" over L'Oréal's involvement on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop.[140] L'Oréal sold The Body Shop to Brazilian group Natura Cosméticos in 2017.[141]\n\n\n\n### Discrimination[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 August 2005, the Supreme Court of California ruled that former L'Oréal sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and remanded the case for trial.[142] The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a dark-skinned sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a \"sexy\" blonde-haired woman and said, \"God damn it, get me one that looks like that.\" Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Oréal USA at the end of 2006.[142]\n\n\nThe company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and institutional racism. In July 2007, the Garnier division and an external employment agency were fined €30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, \"Fructis Style\".[143] L'Oréal is reported as saying the decision was \"incomprehensible\",[144] and would challenge the measure in court.\n\n\nL'Oréal continues to sell skin whitening products, which have been criticized as \"capitalising on women's insecurities due to colourism.\" They advertise these controversial products, which have been criticised for promoting a colonial attitude as well as having safety concerns,[145] on their website by claiming; \"Achieve clear, translucent and radiant skin. Our skin whitening products work to fade dark spots and brighten skin to give you the fair, flawless complexion you desire.\"[146]\n\n\n\n### False advertising[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2007, L'Oréal was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lancôme)[147] ordered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the wrinkle removal capabilities of their products.[148]\n\n\nIn the UK, L'Oréal has faced criticism from OFCOM regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its \"Telescopic\" mascara, featuring Penélope Cruz, stating, \"it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.\" In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing false eyelashes.[149]\n\n\nIn July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Oréal, banning two airbrushed Lancôme advertisements in the UK featuring actress Julia Roberts and supermodel Christy Turlington. The agency issued the ban after British politician Jo Swinson argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Oréal acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.[150]\n\n\nIn June 2014, the company reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as \"false and unsubstantiated\".\n\n\nL'Oréal has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to Facebook every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.[151]\n\n\n\n### Patent lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the University of Massachusetts Medical filed a patent lawsuit against L'Oréal. In August 2017, Dennis Wyrzykowski and his company, Carmel Laboratories LLC, joined the lawsuit. The two parties claimed that L'Oréal's brands used UMass' patented technology for skin creams with the chemical adenosine.[152] In 2021, a judge found the patents invalid. In 2022, the U.S. Appeals Court reversed the decision, stating that UMass could continue to purse its lawsuit.[153]\n\n\n\n### Corporate misconduct[edit]\n\n\nL'Oréal was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[154]\n\n\n\n#### Munroe Bergdorf[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Munroe Bergdorf race row incident\n\nIn August 2017, L'Oréal dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a mixed-race transgender model, after she responded to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, by stating in a Facebook post: \"Honestly I don't have the energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people\"; the post was also quoted as saying that \"[white people's] existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour\", \"racism isn't learned, it's inherited and ... passed down through privilege\" and that \"white people\" ought to \"begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth\".[155] Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Oréal released a statement claiming their commitment to \"[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were \"at odds with those values\".[156][157]\n\n\n\n### Amber Heard[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, L'Oréal Paris hired Amber Heard as a Global Ambassador, also giving a special tribute to her.[158][159] In 2020, after a tape leaked of Heard admitting to having hit her ex-husband Johnny Depp, several petitions were filed requesting L'Oreal to fire her.[160][161][162] As of June 2021, L'Oreal continued to include Heard among a team of \"ambassadors\" that also includes Kate Winslet, Jane Fonda, Elle Fanning, and French singer-songwriter Yseult.[163] Heard was being sued in a defamation trial by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp in which he accused her of domestic abuse. She was found to have defamed her ex-husband with malice on June 2, 2022, by a jury; Heard is currently appealing her case.[164]\n\n\n\n## Brand portfolio[edit]\n\n\n![](image)L'Oréal lipsticks\n![](image)L'Oréal skincare product\nBrands are generally categorized by their targeted markets, such as the mass, professional, luxury, and active cosmetics markets. The Body Shop and Galderma are directly attached to the head office. L'Oréal also owns interests in various activities such as fine chemicals, health, finance, design, advertising, and insurance.[165]\n\n\n\n### Consumer products division[edit]\n\n\n* 3ce[166]\n* Carol's Daughter\n* Colorama\n* Créateurs de Beauté\n* Essie\n* Garnier\n* L'Oréal Paris\n* Magic\n* Maybelline\n* Niely\n* NYX Cosmetics\n* SoftSheen-Carson\n\n### L'Oréal luxe division[edit]\n\n\n* Aesop\n* Atelier Cologne\n* Biotherm\n* Cacharel\n* Clarisonic (Discontinued September 30, 2020)[167]\n* Diesel\n* Giorgio Armani Beauty\n* Guy Laroche\n* Helena Rubinstein\n* House 99\n* IT Cosmetics\n* Kiehl's\n* Lancôme\n* MUGLER\n* Paloma Picasso\n* Proenza Schouler\n* Ralph Lauren Fragrances\n* Shu Uemura\n* Urban Decay\n* Valentino Beauty\n* Viktor & Rolf\n* Yue Sai\n* Yves Saint Laurent Beauté\n\n### Professional products division[edit]\n\n\n* L'Oréal Technique\n* L'Oréal Professionnel, including ARTec and Innate\n* Kérastase (created by L'Oreal in 1964)\n* Kéraskin Esthetics, created by L'Oreal in 2007 and specialising in skin care professionals\n* Matrix Essentials, founded by Arnie Miller in 1980 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2000\n* Mizani, founded in 1991 and bought by L'Oreal in 2001\n* PureOlogy Research, founded in 2001 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2007\n* Redken 5th Avenue NYC, founded by Paula Kent and Jheri Redding in 1960 and acquired by L'Oreal in 1993\n* Shu Uemura Art of Hair\n* Carol's Daughter\n* Carita\n* Essie, founded in 1981 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2010[168]\n* Decléor[169]\n* Botanicals Fresh Care\n* Cheryl's Cosmeceuticals[170]\n\n### Active cosmetics division[edit]\n\n\n* Vichy\n* La Roche-Posay\n* Skinceuticals\n* Roger&Gallet - sold in 2020\n* Sanoflore\n* Dermablend\n* AcneFree\n* Ambi\n* CeraVe\n* Logocos since 2018\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Annual Results 2022\" (PDF).

It is the second largest cosmetics company in the world after L'Oréal. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty, among many more, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founders Estée and Joseph H. Lauder in 1971\nThe company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All-purpose Creme, and Creme Pack.[3] Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\n\nOver the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.\n\n\nIn 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[4] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors.[5] This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968.[*citation needed*] In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique, a dermatologist-guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy-tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand.\n\n\nEstée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called \"Skin Supplies for Men\", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins – the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton,[6] an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[7]\n\n\nBrand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based MAC Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth. The company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[7]\n\n\nOn November 16, 1995, the Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis).[8]\n\n\nAcquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as the Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in the hair salon Bumble and bumble and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand.[7]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)The large Estée Lauder cosmetics counter at MYER Sydney City\n![](image)Small-medium-sized pre-2013 style counter at New Zealand retailer Farmers\nOn October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of the Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand known for its \"Luxury Face Oil\", and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. Later that year, the company also made its first investment in India by buying a minority stake in Forest Essentials, a luxury cosmetics company specializing in Ayurvedic products.[11] In 2015, the company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[12]\n\n\nIn 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, its first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[13] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for US$1.45 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn 2019, the company acquired Dr. Jart+. Founded in Korea in 2004, Dr. Jart+ pioneered the invention of BB Cream, setting the standard for multifunctional beauty.[15]\n\n\nIn 2021, the company acquired Canadian-based Deciem Beauty Group Inc.[16] In 2022, Estée Lauder opened a 300,000 sq ft. distribution center in Galgenen, Switzerland.[17]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the company announced it was to acquire the designer fashion house Tom Ford in a deal worth $2.8bn, with Ford remaining as creative director until at least 2023.[18]\n\n\n\n### Response to the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Estée Lauder Companies announced on August 20, 2020, a reduction in their workforce by 1,500 to 2,000 personnel worldwide, or about 3 percent of total employees. Most of the reductions will be support workers and store employees. The company also announce they would be closing approximately 10 to 15 percent of their stores, close in-store beauty counters, and focus more on digital operations.[19]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe Estée Lauder company has many brands and Estée Lauder is one of the brands. It has had sometimes high-profile spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede – the first African 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[20]\n\n\nIn 2015, Estée Lauder signed model Kendall Jenner to promote the brand.[21]\n\n\nIn 2017, the company announced Violette Serrat as their Global Beauty Director.[22]\n\n\nAlvin Chereskin, the founder of AC&R, was the long-time creative partner of the company.[23]\n\n\n\n## Operations and finances[edit]\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion in the previous year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[24] As of 2018, Estée Lauder Companies ranked 258 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[25]\n\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nLeonard A. Lauder is chairman emeritus. William P. Lauder is executive chairman. Fabrizio Freda is president and chief executive officer.[26]\n\n\n\n## Breast Cancer Awareness campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn October 1992, the Breast Cancer Awareness campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter-in-law) who co-created the \"Pink Ribbon\"[27] with *Self* magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives.\nThe Estée Lauder Companies' annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 19 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation's first and largest corporate supporter.\n\n\nSince 1992, the Estée Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer campaign has raised more than $89 Million globally for lifesaving research, education, and medical services.[28]\n\n\n\n## Environmental activism[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Estée Lauder Companies pledged £100,000 ($115,453) to investigate water quality in Windermere, the largest lake in England. The company has also pledged £500,000 ($577,222) over the next five years that will be used to fund the pioneering nature restoration projects that will be carried out across multiple UK National Parks.[29]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\nThe Estée Lauder Companies brands include:[30]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cosmetics*** AERIN Beauty\n* Bobbi Brown\n* Clinique\n* DECIEM by Brandon Truaxe\n* Dr. Jart+\n* Estée Lauder\n* GLAMGLOW\n* La Mer\n* Lab Series\n* MAC Cosmetics\n* Origins\n* Darphin Paris\n* Smashbox\n* Too Faced[31]\n* Tom Ford Beauty\n | **Fragrance*** Aramis\n* Kilian Paris\n* Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle\n* Jo Malone London\n* Lauder (Fragrances)\n* Le Labo\n\n**Haircare**\n* Aveda\n* Bumble and bumble\n\n\n |\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(March 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### SOPA[edit]\n\n\nEstée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Child labor[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York, making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands. The contracted company was Common Sense Natural Soap & Bodycare, owned by a group led by cult leader Yoneq Gene Spriggs. Estee Lauder said it immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, stating it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.[34]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nThe Estée Lauder Companies perform non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. Estée Lauder Companies product goes through animal testing where required by law by its country government. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[35] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are \"cruelty free\" but were acquired by Estée Lauder.[36]\n\n\n\n### Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]\n\n\n![](image)QUIT activists protesting Estée Lauder Companies, 2004.\nSince at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign led by pro-Palestine activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[37][38] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their \"Estée Slaughter\" campaign.[39] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[40]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\" (PDF). *elcompanies.com*.

Its product categories consist of: skin care, makeup, body care, hair care, and fragrances. The company is one of the oldest cosmetic companies in the world and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022.[4][5] It is the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world.[6] In Japan, Shiseido is available at cosmetic counters at selected department stores and most pharmacies. The company owns numerous brands and subsidiaries worldwide, in addition to its founding label. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, and is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## Company History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nArinobu Fukuhara, former head pharmacist to the Imperial Japanese Navy, established the Shiseido Pharmacy in 1872. After a visit to the United States and Europe, Arinobu added a soda fountain to the store. This later grew into the Shiseido Parlor restaurant business, and eventually led to the introduction of ice cream in Japan. The name *Shiseido* derives from a Chinese expression meaning \"praise the virtues of the earth which nurtures new life and brings forth significant values\".[7][8][9]\n\n\nArinobu passed on his company to his son, Shinzo Fukuhara, who became the company's second president in 1913. After Shinzo's experience traveling to Europe and the United States, he became interested in advertising as a large selling point for Shiseido which lead him to dedicate extensive resources to the company's design, much of which can be seen from product packaging and magazines from this time.[10]\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1917, Shiseido introduced Rainbow Face Powder. This was a face powder with seven colors in a period when white face powders were the norm in Japan.[11] In 1923, the company began expanding its store-base; it now[*timeframe?*] has approximately 25,000 outlets. The company was incorporated as a *kabushiki gaisha* (Japanese joint-stock company) in 1927.[12] In 2017, Shiseido acquired AI and AR developer Giran to get ahead in the tech space. Shisheido plans to use Giaran’s beauty simulation technology to boost its digital sales.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th Century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, Shiseido transitioned from using historical images of Japanese female beauty to more Western ideals of beauty. The more contemporary images showed women with hair swept up rather than cascading back and incorporated trendy art nouveau style block scripts.[10] This shift in imagery coincided with increasing Western influence in Japan, allowing Shiseido to capitalize on this cultural change.[10]\n\n\nThe Ginza district burned during the Kanto Earthquake of 1923. This incident and the great depression in the 1930s, caused a decrease in sales of Shiseido. Shiseido partnered with stores to form the Shiseido Cosmetics Chain Store System. Therefore, consumers could rest assured that they could purchase Shiseido products at the same price at any store. In 1932, the representative Shiseido brand of top class cosmetic products of the time, De Luxe, was born. Following the outbreak of World War II, the De Luxe brand was considered an extravagance and production ceased.[15] However, it was re-launched in 1951, when the economy began to recover. Shiseido started to expand its cosmetics markets to the international market in the 1950s to 1980s.[16]\n\n\n\n### Reformation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Shiseido sold its personal care business to a company held by British equity firm CVC Capital Partners, Shiseido also transferred all of its domestic personal care businesses to its Fine Today Shiseido subsidiary and was sold to CVC after the completion in July 2021.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\n#### Luxury ordinances[edit]\n\n\nA major concern in Japan during the Second World War was wasteful consumption of luxury products. This led to the imposition of luxury ordinances against goods explicitly tailored to luxury consumption. Due to these concerns, Shiseido emphasized the health benefits, high quality (leading to a maximizing of efficacy) and patriotic national production of their cosmetic products. Since Shiseido did not want to tarnish their deluxe brand image their designs and advertisements continued to incorporate highly stylized luxurious motifs. Despite an adherence to these motifs, Shiseido advertisements explicitly emphasized the utilitarian aspects of their products over their luxury, for instance toothpaste was endorsed for keeping teeth and gums healthy (rather than for making them beautifully white).[10]\n\n\n\n### Company magazines[edit]\n\n\nThe company began publishing company magazines in 1924, with *Shiseido Monthly (Shiseido Geppo*), which contained product advertisements and advice about cosmetics and fashion. *Shiseido Monthly* was replaced in 1933, with *The Shiseido Graph* (*Shiseido Gurafu*), and then renamed to *Hanatsubaki* in 1937.[19] *Shiseido Monthly* and *The Shiseido Graph* featured photographs by Shinzo Fukuhara, the company's second president and a well-known photographer.[10]\n\n\nShiseido's public relations magazines are aimed at “inspiring a life of beauty and culture,” following the company's stated corporate ideal.[19]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Shiseido began sales in Taiwan, closely followed by Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1962, Shiseido expanded to Hawaii; in 1965, it established Shiseido Cosmetics America. European sales began with Italy in 1968, Oceania with New Zealand in 1971 and former USSR in 1992 with Russia.[20]\n\n\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first company to produce sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan) from non-animal origin sources.[21]\n\n\n\n## Finances and operations[edit]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Shiseido made a profit of ¥2.66 billion (US$26.87 million) on sales of ¥162.36bn (US$1.64bn).[22] On 15 July 2013, Shiseido announced it was opening a wholly owned subsidiary in India.[23] On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decléor brands to L’Oréal for €227.5M (US$312.93M). This sale resulted in Shiseido showing profits despite running into losses.[24]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Shiseido cut their profit forecast and suffered a 14% decline in stock price, the largest drop in a single day since October 2008. Shiseido cited dropping demand in the Chinese market after the Japanese government approved releasing radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi reactor into the Pacific Ocean. This decision drove Chinese customers to boycott or avoid Japanese cosmetics brands.[25]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Shiseido's wholly owned brands and subsidiaries, as well as exclusive licensing agreements.[26]\n\n\n\n### Prestige division[edit]\n\n\n* BAUM\n* BENEFIQUE\n* Clé de Peau Beauté\n* Drunk Elephant\n* EFFECTIM\n* IPSA\n* ISSEY MIYAKE\n* NARS\n* narciso rodriguez\n* Serge Lutens\n* Shiseido\n* THE GINZA\n* Tory Burch\n* Ulé\n\n### Premium division[edit]\n\n\n* ANESSA\n* AQUA LABEL\n* AUPRES\n* d program\n* ELIXIR\n* GRACY\n* HAKU\n* INTEGRATE\n* MAJOLICA MAJORCA\n* MAQuillAGE\n* PRIOR\n* REVITAL\n* SIDEKICK\n* URARA\n\n### Inner Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* INRYU\n* The Collagen\n\n### Life Quality Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* Perfect Cover\n\n## Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 18, 2017, Shiseido acquired Palo Alto, California-based, digital tech company MATCHCo, a startup described by co-founder and former professional skateboarder, Andy Howell, as \"AI for beauty.\"[27] The MATCHCo technology was rebranded by Shiseido as MADE-2-FIT, a bareMinerals iPhone app which offered \"precise skin tone analysis via a set of simple user scans, with the help of a virtual makeup artist with voice guidance.\"[27] To supplement MatchCo., Shiseido later acquired Giaran Inc., a data driven company, in November, 2017.[28]\n\n\nIn January 2018, the company acquired all of the assets of Olivo Laboratories.[29]\n\n\n\n## Make-up[edit]\n\n\nShiseido produces a line of cosmetics simply called \"The Makeup\" that provide a full range of products including: lip products, powder eye shadows, eye liner pencils, mascara, fluid and compact foundations, concealers, and powder blushes. Their hydro powder eye shadows which have a creamy texture are among *Allure* magazine's top beauty picks.[30]\n\n\nShiseido stepped into the world of cosmetics with the introduction of Eudermine in 1897, and established the Cosmetics Division and a store selling cosmetics in 1916. With the birth of new cosmetics, the definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich” aesthetic.[10]\n\n\nMeanwhile, modern beauty methods became a popular beauty topic in advertisements, newspaper columns and magazines in the late 1920s, to early 1930s. At that time, cosmetic consumers focused on the selection of the makeup and their uses. The single makeup method of painting the face white was considered outdated.[31] The beauty consumers liked to apply up to seven different colors of face powder including ‘’ white, yellow, flesh, rose, peony, green and purple’’ to match their skin tone.[32] In order to explore more potential consumers, Shiseido trained beauty advisers, who demonstrated and illustrated the uses of the cosmetics on the on-site demonstration briefing.\n\n\n\n## Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Shiseido's subsidiary company, NARS Cosmetics, announced it was going to start testing their products on animals. In defense of its decision, the company stated \"We have decided to make NARS available in China because we feel it is important to bring our vision of beauty and artistry to fans in the region. Nars does not test on animals or ask others to do so on our behalf, except where required by law\".[33]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Weil, Jennifer (24 December 2013). \"Shiseido Names New President and CEO\".

With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Corporate overview[edit]\n\n\nCoty is one of the world's largest beauty companies and the largest fragrance company,[4][5] with $5.3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year 2022.[6] Coty acquired 41 beauty brands from Procter & Gamble in 2016,[7] becoming the global leader in fragrance, the second largest company for hair color and styling products,[8] and the third largest company for color cosmetics.[9] The company operates three divisions: Consumer Beauty, which focuses on body care, color cosmetics, fragrances, and hair coloring and styling products; Luxury, for luxury cosmetic, fragrance, and skin care products; and Professional Beauty, which services beauty salon and nail salon professionals.[10][11] Coty's mission is to \"celebrate and liberate the diversity of beauty\".[12]\n\n\nThe company has approximately 20,000 full-time employees in 46 countries, as of mid 2018.[1] Coty's executive offices are located in London.[13] The Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty divisions are headquartered in New York City, Paris and Geneva, respectively.[1] Peter Harf is Coty's chairman.[14] Pierre Laubies was Coty's CEO,[14] but on June 1, 2020 he was replaced by Harf.[15] Pierre-André Terisse was appointed chief financial officer in January 2019.[16] In July 2020, it was announced that Sue Youcef Nabi will become the company's new chief executive officer. Nabi who has previously served as L'Oréal's executive, is slated to take over the position in September the same year.[17]\n\n\nJAB Holding Company is Coty's largest shareholder, with a 60 percent stake.[18]\n\n\n\n## Brands and products[edit]\n\n\nCoty owns approximately 77 brands, as of 2018 and has partnerships with various other brands, including:[19]\n\n\n\n* Adidas[20]\n* Alexander McQueen[21]\n* Balenciaga[22][23]\n* Bottega Veneta[24]\n* Bourjois[25]\n* Bruno Banani[21]\n* Burberry[26]\n* Calvin Klein\n* Chloé[19]\n* Clairol[27]\n* David Beckham\n* Davidoff\n* Dolce & Gabbana\n* Escada[21]\n* Good Hair Day (ghd)[28]\n* Gucci\n* Hugo Boss[21]\n* James Bond (007 James Bond)[21]\n* Jil Sander[29]\n* JOOP!\n* Katy Perry\n* Kylie Cosmetics (51%)\n* KKW Beauty (20%)[30]\n* Lacoste (fragrances)[21]\n* Marc Jacobs[31]\n* Max Factor[31]\n* Mexx[21]\n* Miu Miu[32]\n* Nautica\n* OPI Products[33]\n* philosophy\n* Rimmel[33]\n* Roberto Cavalli[34]\n* Sally Hansen[35]\n* Stella McCartney[21]\n* Tiffany & Co[36]\n* Vera Wang\n* Wella[27]\n\nCoty relaunched the CoverGirl and Clairol brands, including the Nice 'n Easy hair coloring product, in late 2017 and early 2018, respectively. The relaunches included new messaging and product development, with an emphasis on diversity.[33][37][38] The company also relaunched Max Factor in 2018.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1900s–1920s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)François Coty in 1926\nCoty was founded by François Coty in Paris in 1904.[1][2] The brand's first fragrance, La Rose Jacqueminot, was launched the same year and was packaged in a bottle designed by Baccarat.[42] L'Origan was launched in 1905; according to *The Week*, the perfume \"started a sweeping trend throughout Paris\" and was the first example of \"a fine but affordable fragrance that would appeal both to the upper classes and to the less affluent, changing the way scents were sold forever\".[43] Following its early successes, Coty was able to open its first store in 1908 in Paris' Place Vendôme.[42] Soon after, Coty began collaborating with French glass designer René Lalique to create custom fragrance bottles, labels, and other packaging materials, launching a new trend in mass-produced fragrance packaging.[44][45] Coty also established a \"Perfume City\" in the suburbs of Paris during the early 1910s to handle administration and fragrance production; the site was an early business supporter of female employees and offered benefits including child care.[42]\n\n\nThe company began its global expansion in the early 1910s, first in London and New York.[46][47] Coty established U.S. headquarters at 714 Fifth Avenue in New York City, and commissioned Lalique to design pressed glass panels for the building's façade windows, which were installed in 1912.[44][48] Coty remained headquartered in the building until 1941.[48] The structure was later given landmark status by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission during the 1980s for its custom windows.[49][50]\nCoty began selling other beauty products including face and body powders in the 1910s, and launched one of its most successful fragrances, Chypre, in 1917. The company's products gained more attention in the United States as World War I soldiers started returning from France with gifts for loved ones. During the 1920s, Coty launched more than fifteen new fragrances and expanded into Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.[44] Coty, Inc. was formed in New York in 1922, and became a publicly-traded company in 1925.[51]\n\n\n\n### 1930s–1990s[edit]\n\n\nFrançois Coty died in 1934; his family maintained control of the company and served as board members until the 1960s.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Coty Pavillion at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\nCoty's Air Spun face powder was launched in 1935.[42] The powder has been described by *Real Simple* as one of the \"best beauty products of all time\" and remains mostly unchanged.[52]\n\n\nIn the 1940s, Coty became a major supporter of the growing American fashion industry, launching the Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards to recognize and promote emerging American fashion designers. Coty discontinued its participation in 1985.[53][54]\n\n\nCoty became a key player in the American lipstick market with the launch of Coty 24 in 1955. By the 1960s, Coty had become a leading fragrance manufacturer and marketer and the largest fragrance company in the U.S.[44] It attracted the attention of Pfizer, which acquired the company in 1963.[2][44]\n\n\nIn 1991, the company had annual sales of approximately $280 million.[55][56] Pfizer sold Coty to Joh. A. Benckiser (now known as JAB Holding Company) in 1992. Coty was a strategic fit for Benckiser, which had another beauty subsidiary, as well as an international distribution network through which it could market Coty's products.[55] Coty's fragrances at the time included Emeraude, Exclamation, L'Effleur, Preferred Stock, Sand & Sable, Tribe, and Wild Musk.[55][57] Peter Harf, chairman and CEO of JAB since 1988, was named Coty's CEO in 1993.[44] Coty acquired Unilever's European cosmetic brands, including Rimmel, in 1996.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nDuring the mid 2000s, the company focused on marketing celebrity-endorsed fragrances, including David Beckham, Céline Dion, Jennifer Lopez, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Shania Twain.[58] Coty also expanded its portfolio of luxury fragrances. It purchased the fragrance license for fashion designer Marc Jacobs in 2003.[59] The company's revenue increased from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion during 2004–2005.[58][60]\n\n\nIn 2005, Coty purchased additional licenses for Calvin Klein, Cerruti, Chloé, Lagerfeld, and Vera Wang from Unilever.[61] These newest acquisitions, along with existing portfolio licenses including Adidas, Davidoff, and JOOP!,[62][63] made Coty the largest global fragrance maker.[2][60]\n\n\nCoty acquired Del Laboratories' parent company, DLI Holding Corp., in 2007, adding the Sally Hansen and NYC New York Color brands to Coty's portfolio.[64][65] The company entered into license agreements with Balenciaga in 2008 and Bottega Veneta in 2009.[22][66][67]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Coty purchased nail polish maker OPI Products,[68] as well as the skin care brand philosophy from The Carlyle Group.[59][69] The company also entered into a license agreement with Miu Miu, a subsidiary of Prada.[32]\n\n\nCoty filed to go public in June 2012, and raised approximately $1 billion during its initial public offering (IPO) one year later.[70][71] The IPO, held in 2013, was the third largest in the US at the time and the largest by a final goods company since Michael Kors.[70] CNN Money described the offering as the \"largest U.S.-listed IPO for a consumer products company\".[71] Coty acquired Bourjois in 2014.[72]\n\n\nDuring 2015–2016, Coty acquired 41 beauty brands from Procter & Gamble (collectively known as Galleria),[7] including Clairol, CoverGirl, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Max Factor, and Wella.[27][31][26] The agreement, completed as a Reverse Morris Trust, made Coty the third largest global seller of cosmetics.[9][33][73] Coty also acquired the digital marketing technology agency Beamly in 2015.[74][75][76]\n\n\nThe company entered into a license agreement with Tiffany & Co. in 2016.[77] During 2016–2017, Coty acquired Hypermarcas' (now known as Hypera Pharma) beauty and personal care business, ghd, and became a majority stakeholder in the peer to peer digital beauty company Younique.[78] Younique had approximately 80,000 sellers when Coty purchased a 60 percent stake in January 2017, and surpassed 230,000 sellers by December.[79] Coty announced that it was cutting ties with Younique in August 2019, saying that Younique was \"definitely different\" from other businesses owned by Coty, and intended to sell its 60% stake in Younique back to its founders.[80]\n\n\nCoty acquired licenses to Burberry's cosmetics and fragrance brands in April 2017.[81] In July, Coty added the skincare brand philosophy to Tmall,[82] and launched other brands on the platform as well.[41][83]\n\n\nIn December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union's European Court of Justice ruled that Coty did not violate competition laws by forbidding German distributor Parfümerie Akzente from selling products via Amazon, and that luxury brands are allowed to prohibit distributors from selling through third-party platforms.[19][84][85] Previously, according to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, Coty supported the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill introduced to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to combat copyright infringement and counterfeit goods trafficking, in late 2011.[86][87]\n\n\nCoty developed \"Let's Get Ready\" for the Amazon Echo Show; the guide debuted in early 2018 and presents looks and products to users, which can be added to shopping carts.[88] In February, Coty created a startup accelerator focused on artificial intelligence.[89][90]\n\n\nThe company underwent refinancing of debt, including debt associated with Galleria, in March 2018.[7]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Coty announced to purchase a $600 million stake (51%) in Kylie Cosmetics, the company of media personality and model Kylie Jenner.[91][92] In June 2020, the company announced that it would buy a 20% stake for $200 million in KKW, a company owned by Jenner's sister Kim Kardashian West.[30]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2020, Coty completed sale of Wella, Clairol, OPI and ghd brands stake to KKR for $2.5bn in cash whilst retaining 40% stake in the standalone company.[93] On October 1, 2021, Coty announced that it would sell an approximate 9% stake in Wella to KKR for $426.5 million. The deal cuts Coty's stake in Wella, Clairol, OPI and ghd brands to around 30.6%.[94]\n\n\n\n## Environmental practices and social causes[edit]\n\n\nCoty and its brands say they are committed to a range of social causes as well as seeking to minimize its environmental impact. The company has entered into a long-term partnership with the international advocacy group Global Citizen to tackle prejudice and discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, or ethnicity, and to promote self-expression.[95] Coty has also joined other beauty companies to launch the Responsible Beauty Initiative to encourage sustainability within the industry.[96] Coty has signed the United Nations Global Compact, a UN initiative to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies.\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\nCoty ranked number 371 on the Fortune 500, *Fortune* magazine's annual list of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue, in 2018.[97] The company ranked number 5 on *Women's Wear Daily*'s 2017 \"Top 100\" list of the world's largest beauty manufacturers, estimating $9.15 billion in sales.[98] According to *Advertising Age*, Coty was one of the largest global advertisers in 2017.[99] In 2018, Coty ranked number 1,196 on the *Forbes* Global 2000, an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world.[100] Additionally, Coty ranked number 396 on *Forbes's* 2018 list of \"America's Largest Public Companies\".[100]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (C)\n* List of organizations with official stances on the SOPA and PIPA\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Form 10-K: Coty Inc\".
