You can help by updating items to more recent figures from official sources.\n\n![](image)Cartogram of the world's population in 2018; each square represents 500,000 people.\nThis is a **list of countries and dependencies by population**. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and dependencies by population density and List of regional organizations by population\n\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\n\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]\n\n\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population[edit]\n\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Country / Dependency | Population | % ofworld | Date | Source (official or

The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. While the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the incumbent China's paramount leader and commander-in-chief.\n\n\nThe first state representative of the People's Republic of China was the chairman of the Central People's Government, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\n\n\nDuring the Mao era, there were no term limits for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished in order to align the presidency with the position of CCP general secretary, which does not have term limits. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Establishment in 1954[edit]\n\n\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.[2] Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental.[2] The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defence Council (Chinese: \u56fd\u9632\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a).\"[2] The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference (Chinese: \u6700\u9ad8\u56fd\u52a1\u4f1a\u8bae) and acts as its chairman.\"[2] The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.[2] The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n\n\n### History up to 1974[edit]\n\n\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman Dong Biwu as \"acting state chairman\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Abolition in 1975[edit]\n\n\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of state chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the CCP chairman supreme commander of the PLA in concurrence as chairman of the party CMC, while the duties of state representative were transferred to the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.[3] The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of state chairman, but did place a greater emphasis on the ceremonial roles performed by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as state representative.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Restoration in 1982[edit]\n\n\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose. Research showed that having the NPCSC chairman as the national representative created problems, as the position was equivalent to the speaker of parliament in other countries. Deng Xiaoping agreed to restore the presidency, but without powers in specific government affairs.[4]\n\n\nThe office was reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.[4] In the 1982 Constitution, the party developed policy while the state executed it, and the president was conceived of as a ceremonial and replacement figure with a role similar to that of equivalent of figurehead presidents in parliamentary republics. Actual state power was vested in the general secretary of the Communist Party, the premier, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As part of the effort to prevent another leader from rising above the party as Mao had done, all four posts were intended to be held by separate people. The president therefore performed ceremonial duties such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. The constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983\u20131988) and Yang Shangkun (1988\u20131993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then\u2013Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president.[9] Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of general secretary of the party and CMC chairman, which do not have term limits.[10]\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a Chinese citizen;\n* have the right to vote and stand for election;\n* be at least 45 years old.[11][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[12][*non-primary source needed*] However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders.[13] Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.[13]\n\n\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe president functions as the state representative of the PRC as well as the supreme representative of China both internally and externally.[14] According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state institution that represents the PRC in state activities, but the presidency is served by one person.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councilors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic.[note 2] Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state. It is therefore conceived to mainly function as a symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.[15][16][17]\n\n\nIn theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u5e2d\u529e\u516c\u5ba4; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed B\u00e0ng\u014dngsh\u00ec*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\nThe political ranking of the presidency has changed throughout the decades, influenced by the officeholder of the time. 2nd President Liu Shaoqi was also the first-ranked vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party, behind CCP Chairman Mao Zedong.[21] President Li Xiannian was also the 5th ranked member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the CCP general secretary and Chinese premier.[22] President Yang Shangkun was not a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang/Jiang Zemin and CMC Chairman Deng Xiaoping.[23] Since Jiang Zemin's accession to the office in 1993, the president has also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking first in party and state.[24]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: \u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China.

The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected by the citizens.\n\n\nArticle 53 of the Constitution of India states that the president can exercise their powers directly or by subordinate authority, though all of the executive powers vested in the president are, in practice, exercised by the prime minister heading the Council of Ministers.[3] The president is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the Council and to enforce the decrees passed by the Supreme Court under article 142.\n\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\nIndia achieved independence from the British on 15 August 1947, initially as a dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations with George VI as king, represented in the country by a governor-general.[4] Following independence, the Constituent Assembly of India, under the leadership of B. R. Ambedkar, undertook the process of drafting a completely new constitution for the country. The Constitution of India was eventually enacted on 26 November 1949 and came into force on 26 January 1950,[5]:\u200a26 making India a republic.[6]:\u200a9 The offices of monarch and governor-general were replaced by the new office of President of India, with Rajendra Prasad as its first incumbent.[6]:\u200a1 India retained its Commonwealth membership per the London Declaration, recognising The King as \"the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth.\"[7]\n\n\nThe Indian constitution accords to the president the responsibility and authority to defend and protect the Constitution of India and its rule of law.[8] Invariably, any action taken by the executive or legislature entities of the constitution shall become law only after the president's assent. The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature. The role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution of India is the second line of defence in nullifying any unconstitutional actions of the executive and legislative entities of the Indian Union.\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\n\n> Under the draft constitution the President occupies the same position as the King under the English Constitution. He is the head of the state but not of the Executive. He represents the Nation but does not rule the Nation. He is the symbol of the Nation. His place in the administration is that of a ceremonial device on a seal by which the nation's decisions are made known.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aBhimrao Ambedkar, as chairperson of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India during various debates about the president being constitutional head of the state.[9][10]\n> \n\n\n### Duty[edit]\n\n\nThe primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India as made part of their oath (Article 60 of Indian constitution).[8] The president is the common head of all independent constitutional entities. All their actions, recommendations (Article 3, Article 111, Article 274, etc.) and supervisory powers (Article 74(2), Article 78C, Article 108, Article 111, etc.) over the executive and legislative entities of India shall be used in accordance to uphold the constitution.[11] There is no bar on the actions of the president to contest in the court of law.[12]\n\n\n\n### Legislative powers[edit]\n\n\nLegislative power is constitutionally vested in the Parliament of India of which the president is the head, to facilitate the lawmaking process per the constitution (Article 78, Article 86, etc.). The president summons both the houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) of the parliament and prorogues them. They can dissolve the Lok Sabha.[5]:\u200a147\n\n\nThe president inaugurates parliament by addressing it after the general elections and also at the beginning of the first session every year per Article 87(1). The presidential address on these occasions is generally meant to outline the new policies of the government.[13]:\u200a145\n\n\nAll bills passed by the parliament can become laws only after receiving the assent of the president per Article 111. After a bill is presented to them, the president shall declare either that they assent to the Bill, or that they withhold assent from it. As a third option, they can return a bill to parliament, if it is not a money bill, for reconsideration. President may be of the view that a particular bill passed under the legislative powers of parliament is violating the constitution, they can send back the bill with their recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the Article 368 procedure. When, after reconsideration, the bill is passed accordingly and presented to the president, with or without amendments, the president cannot withhold their assent from it. The president can also withhold their assent to a bill when it is initially presented to them (rather than return it to parliament) thereby exercising a pocket veto on the advice of the prime minister or council of ministers per Article 74 if it is inconsistent with the constitution.[12] Article 143 gives the president the power to consult the supreme court about the constitutional validity of an issue. The president shall assent to constitutional amendment bills without power to withhold the bills per Article 368 (2).\n\n\nWhen either of the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the government feels the need for an immediate procedure, the president can promulgate ordinances that have the same force and effect as an act passed by parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier.[14] Under Article 123, the president as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and they are confident that the government commands majority support in the parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of parliament when in force and it is the responsibility of the president to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for the promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and president, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of the law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of an ordinance after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the president.[15] The president should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which violates the constitution or requires an amendment to the constitution. The president should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the parliament or violates the constitution.[16] Thus, it is believed that the POI is the de jure head of the state, whereas PM is the de facto head.\n\n\n\n### Executive powers[edit]\n\n\n\n> The President of the Indian Union will be generally bound by the advice of his Ministers. ... He can do nothing contrary to their advice nor can do anything without their advice. The President of the United States can dismiss any Secretary at any time. The President of the Indian Union has no power to do so, so long as his Ministers command a majority in Parliament\n> \n> \u2014\u200aBhimrao Ambedkar, chairperson of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India[9]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Presidential Standard of India (1950\u20131971)\nAs per Article 53, the executive power of the country is vested in the president and is exercised by the president either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the constitution. When parliament thinks fit it may accord additional executive powers to the president per Article 70 which may be further delegated by the president to the governors of states per Article 160. Union cabinet with prime minister as its head, should aid and advise the president in performing their functions. Per Article 74 (2), the council of ministers or prime minister are not accountable legally to the advice tendered to the president but it is the sole responsibility of the president to ensure compliance with the constitution in performing their duties. President or their subordinate officers is bound by the provisions of the constitution notwithstanding any advice by the union cabinet.[17]\n\n\nAs per Article 142, it is the duty of the president to enforce the decrees of the supreme court.\n\n\n\n### Judicial powers[edit]\n\n\nThe primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India per Article 60. The president appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges on the advice of the chief justice. The President may dismiss a judge with a two-thirds vote of the two Houses of the parliament.[18]\n\n\nThe Indian government's chief legal adviser, Attorney General of India, is appointed by the president of India under Article 76(1) and holds office during the pleasure of the president. If the president considers a question of law or a matter of public importance has arisen, they can also ask for the advisory opinion of the supreme court per Article 143. Per Article 88, the president can ask the attorney general to attend the parliamentary proceedings and report to him any unlawful functioning if any.[19]\n\n\n\n### Appointment powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president appoints as prime minister, the person most likely to command the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha (usually the leader of the majority party or coalition). The president then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers, distributing portfolios to them on the advice of the prime minister.[20]:\u200a72 The Council of Ministers remains in power at the 'pleasure' of the president.\n\n\nThe president appoints 12 members of the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service. The president may nominate not more than two members of Anglo Indian community as Lok Sabha members per Article 331, which was removed in 2019.\n\n\nGovernors of states are also appointed by the president who shall work at the pleasure of the president. Per Article 156, the president is empowered to dismiss a governor who has violated the constitution in their acts.\n\n\nThe president is responsible for making a wide variety of appointments. These include:[20]:\u200a72\n\n\n\n* The Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court of India and state/union territory high courts.\n* The Chief Minister of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Article 239 AA 5 of the constitution).\n* The Comptroller and Auditor General Of India.\n* The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.\n* The Chairman and other members of the Union Public Service Commission.\n* The Attorney General Of India.\n* Ambassadors and High Commissioners to other countries (only through the list of names given by the prime minister).[21][22]:\u200a48\n* Officers of the All India Services (IAS, IPS and IFoS), and other Central Civil Services in Group 'A'.\n\n\n### Financial powers[edit]\n\n\n* A financial bill can be introduced in the parliament only with the president's recommendation.\n* The president lays the Annual Financial Statement, i.e. the Union budget, before the parliament.\n* The president can take advances out of the Contingency Fund of India to meet unforeseen expenses.\n* The president constitutes a Finance Commission every five years to recommend the distribution of the taxes between the centre and the States. The most recent was constituted in 2017.[23][24][25]\n\n\n### Diplomatic powers[edit]\n\n\nAll international treaties and agreements are negotiated and concluded on behalf of the president.[26]:\u200a18 However, in practice, such negotiations are usually carried out by the prime minister along with their Cabinet (especially the Minister of External Affairs). Also, such treaties are subject to the approval of the parliament. The president represents India in international forums and affairs where such a function is chiefly ceremonial. The president may also send and receive diplomats, i.e. the officers from the Indian Foreign Service.[27]:\u200a143 The president is the first citizen of the country.[21]\n\n\n\n### Military powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces. Only the president can declare war or conclude peace,[21] on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers headed by the prime minister. All important treaties and contracts are made in the president's name.[28]\n\n\n\n### Pardoning powers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidential pardon\n\nAs mentioned in Article 72 of the Indian constitution, the president is empowered with the powers to grant pardons in the following situations:[21]\n\n\n\n* punishment for an offence against Union law\n* punishment by a military court\n* a death sentence[28]\n\n\nThe decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the president are independent of the opinion of the prime minister or the Lok Sabha majority. In most cases, however, the president exercises their executive powers on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.[20]:\u200a239[29]\n\n\n\n### Emergency powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president can declare three types of emergencies: national, state and financial, under articles 352, 356 & 360 in addition to promulgating ordinances under article 123.[26]:\u200a12\n\n\n\n#### National emergency[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Emergency (India)\n\nA national emergency can be declared in the whole of India or a part of its territory for causes of war or armed rebellion or an external aggression. Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 (Indo-China war), 1971 (Indo-Pakistan war),[30] and 1975 to 1977 (declared by Indira Gandhi).[see main]\n\n\nUnder Article 352 of the India constitution, the president can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the cabinet of ministers headed by the prime minister. Such a proclamation must be approved by the parliament with at least a two-thirds majority within one month. Such an emergency can be imposed for six months. It can be extended by six months by repeated parliamentary approval-there is no maximum duration.[26][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn such an emergency, Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens can be suspended.[5]:\u200a33 The six freedoms under Right to Freedom are automatically suspended. However, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty cannot be suspended (Article 21).[31]:\u200a20.6\n\n\nThe president can make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state governments can make laws).[32] Also, all money bills are referred to the president for approval.[33]:\u200a88 The term of the Lok Sabha can be extended by a period of up to one year, but not so as to extend the term of parliament beyond six months after the end of the declared emergency.[20]:\u200a223\n\n\nNational Emergency has been proclaimed 3 times in India to date. It was declared first in 1962 by President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, during the Sino-Indian War. This emergency lasted through the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and up to 1968. It was revoked in 1968. The second emergency in India was proclaimed in 1971 by President V. V. Giri on the eve of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The first two emergencies were in the face of external aggression and War. They were hence external emergencies. Even as the second emergency was in progress, another internal emergency was proclaimed by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, with Indira Gandhi as prime minister in 1975. In 1977, the second and the third emergencies were together revoked.\n\n\n\n#### State emergency[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federalism in India\n\nIf the president is not fully satisfied, on the basis of the report of the governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the constitution, they can proclaim under Article 356 a state of emergency in the state.[8] Such an emergency must be approved by the parliament within a period of 2 months.\n\n\nUnder Article 356 of the Indian constitution, it can be imposed from six months to a maximum period of three years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months. If the emergency needs to be extended for more than three years, this can be achieved by a constitutional amendment, as has happened in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\nDuring such an emergency, the president can take over the entire work of the executive, and the governor administers the state in the name of the president. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list[34] (see National emergency for explanation).\n\n\nA State Emergency can be imposed via the following:\n\n\n\n1. By Article 356\u00a0\u2013 If that state failed to run constitutionally, i.e. constitutional machinery has failed. When a state emergency is imposed under this provision, the state is said to be under \"President's rule.[35]:\u200a159\n2. By Article 365\u00a0\u2013 If that state is not working according to the direction of the Union government issued per the provisions of the constitution.[36]\n\n\nThis type of emergency needs the approval of the parliament within 2 months. It can last up to a maximum of three years via extensions after each 6-month period. However, after one year it can be extended only if\n\n\n\n1. A state of National Emergency has been declared in the country or the particular state.\n2. The Election Commission finds it difficult to organise an election in that state.\n\n\nThe Sarkaria Commission held that presidents have unconstitutionally misused the provision of Article 356 many times for achieving political motives, by dismissing the state governments although there was no constitutional break down in the states.[37] During 2005, President's rule was imposed in Bihar state, misusing Article 356 unconstitutionally to prevent the democratically elected state legislators to form a government after the state elections.\n\n\nThere is no provision in the constitution to re-promulgate president's rule in a state when the earlier promulgation ceased to operate for want of parliaments approval within two months duration. During 2014 in Andhra Pradesh, president's rule was first imposed on 1 March 2014 and it ceased to operate on 30 April 2014. President's rule was promulgated after being fully aware that the earliest parliament session is feasible at the end of May 2014 after the general elections. It was reimposed again unconstitutionally on 28 April 2014 by the president.[38][39]\n\n\n\n#### Financial emergency[edit]\n\n\nArticle 282 accords financial autonomy in spending the financial resources available with the states for public purposes.[8][40] Article 293 gives liberty to states to borrow without any limit to its ability for its requirements within the territory of India without any consent from the Union government. However, the Union government can insist on compliance with its loan terms when a state has an outstanding loan charged to the consolidated fund of India or an outstanding loan in respect of which a guarantee has been given by the Government of India under the liability of consolidated fund of India.[41]\n\n\nUnder article 360 of the constitution, the president can proclaim a financial emergency when the financial stability or credit of the nation or any part of its territory is threatened.[8] However, until now no guidelines defining the situation of financial emergency in the entire country or a state or union territory or a panchayat or a municipality or a corporation have been framed either by the finance commission or by the central government.\n\n\nSuch an emergency must be approved by the parliament within two months by a simple majority. It has never been declared.[42]:\u200a604 A state of financial emergency remains in force indefinitely until revoked by the president.[20]:\u200a195\n\n\nThe president can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the supreme court and high courts, in cases of a financial emergency. All money bills passed by state legislatures are submitted to the president for approval. They can direct the state to observe certain principles (economy measures) relating to financial matters.[43]\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 58 of the constitution sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president must be:\n\n\n\n* a citizen of India\n* of 35 years of age or above\n* qualified to become a member of the Lok Sabha\n\n\nA person shall not be eligible for election as president if they hold any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.\n\n\nCertain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates. These are:\n\n\n\n* The current vice-president\n* The governor of any state\n* A Minister of the Union or of any state (including prime minister and chief ministers)[20]:\u200a72\n\n\nIn the event that the vice-president, a state governor or a minister is elected president, they are considered to have vacated their previous office on the date they begin serving as president.\n\n\nA member of parliament or a State Legislature can seek election to the office of the president but if they are elected as president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in parliament or State Legislature on the date on which they enter upon their office as President **[Article 59(1)]**.\n\n\n**Article 57** provides that a person who holds, or who has held, office as president shall, subject to the other provisions of this constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office.\n\n\nUnder the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952,[44] a candidate to be nominated for the office of president needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for their name to appear on the ballot.[45]\n\n\n\n## Time of election[edit]\n\n\nArticle 56(1) of the constitution provides that the president shall hold office for a term of five years, from the date on which they enter their office. According to Article 62, an election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration of the term of office of President shall be completed before the expiration of the term. An election to fill a vacancy in the office of President occurring by reason of their death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible after, and in no case later than six months from, the date of occurrence of the vacancy; and the person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of Article 56, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which they enter their office.\n\n\nTo meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of an election due to death of a candidate or on account of the postponement of the poll for any valid reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the expiration of their term, continue to hold office until their successor enters into office.\n\n\n\n### Conditions for the presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral College (India)\n\nCertain conditions, per Article 59 of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections. The conditions are:\n\n\n\n* The president shall not be a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state, and if a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state is elected president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in that house on the date on which they enter into office as president.\n* The president shall not hold any other office of profit.\n* The president shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of their official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by parliament by law and until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule.\n* The emoluments and allowances of the president shall not be diminished during their term of office.[42]:\u200a170\n\n\n### Election process[edit]\n\n\nWhenever the office becomes vacant, the new president is chosen by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both houses of parliament (MPs), the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabha) of all States and the elected members of the legislative assemblies (MLAs) of union territories with legislatures, i.e., National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry. The election process of the president is a more extensive process than of the prime minister who is also elected indirectly (elected by the members of the majority party (or union) in the Lok Sabha). Whereas President being the constitutional head with duties to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and rule of law in a constitutional democracy with constitutional supremacy, is elected in an extensive manner by the members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and state legislative assemblies in a secret ballot procedure.\n\n\nThe nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of \u20b915,000 (US$180) in the Reserve Bank of India.[46] The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.\n\n\nThe election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation (PR) by means of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) method.[47] The voting takes place by a secret ballot system. The manner of election of President is provided by Article 55 of the constitution.[48]\n\n\nEach elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.\n\n\nThe actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.\n\n\nAlthough Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by MPs and MLAs, they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.[49]\n\n\n\n### Oath or affirmation[edit]\n\n\nThe president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the Chief Justice of India\u2014or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the supreme court\u2014an oath or affirmation to protect, preserve and defend the constitution as follows:[50]\n\n\n\n\n> I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President (or discharge the functions of the President) of the Republic of India, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law, and that I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of India.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aArticle 60, Constitution of India\n> \n\n\n## Emoluments[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Presidential pay**\n| Date updated | Salary (per month)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 February 2018 | \u20b95 lakh (US$6,000)\n |\n| Sources:[51] |\n\n\nThe president of India used to receive \u20b910,000 (US$100) per month per the Second Schedule of the constitution. This amount was increased to \u20b950,000 (equivalent to \u20b9230,000 or US$2,700 in 2023) in 1998. On 11 September 2008, the Government of India increased the salary of the president to \u20b91.5 lakh (equivalent to \u20b94.2 lakh or US$5,000 in 2023). This amount was further increased to \u20b95 lakh (equivalent to \u20b96.7 lakh or US$8,000 in 2023) in the 2018 Union budget of India. However, almost everything that the president does or wants to do is taken care of by an annual \u20b9225 million (equivalent to \u20b9630\u00a0million or US$7.5\u00a0million in 2023) budget that the Government allots for their upkeep.[52] Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's official residence, is the largest Presidential palace in the world.[53][54] The Rashtrapati Nilayam at Bolarum, Hyderabad and Retreat Building at Chharabra, Shimla are the official Retreat Residences of the president of India. The official state car of the president is a custom-built heavily armored Mercedes Benz S600 (W221) Pullman Guard.\n\n\nThe former presidents and widows and widowers of presidents are eligible for pension, furnished accommodation, security, various allowances, etc.[55]\n\n\n\n* Presidential amenities\n* ![Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president, located in New Delhi](image)\n\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president, located in New Delhi\n* ![Rashtrapati Nilayam is the official retreat of the president located in Hyderabad.](image)\n\nRashtrapati Nilayam is the official retreat of the president located in Hyderabad.\n* ![The Retreat Building is the official summer retreat of the president located in Shimla.](image)\n\nThe Retreat Building is the official summer retreat of the president located in Shimla.\n* ![The President's Bodyguards is an elite household cavalry regiment of the Indian Army.](image)\n\nThe President's Bodyguards is an elite household cavalry regiment of the Indian Army.\n* ![A chopper of IAF's special VIP fleet meant for carrying the President of India](image)\n\nA chopper of IAF's special VIP fleet meant for carrying the President of India\n* ![VIP B777 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for international travels by the President.](image)\n\nVIP B777 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for international travels by the President.\n* ![Indian Air Force's BBJ 737 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for domestic travels by the President.](image)\n\nIndian Air Force's BBJ 737 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for domestic travels by the President.\n\n\n## Impeachment[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court shall inquire and decide regarding all *doubts* and *disputes* arising out of or in connection with the election of a president per Article 71(1) of the constitution. The Supreme Court can remove the president for the electoral malpractices or upon being not eligible to be a member of the Lok Sabha under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.[56] Subject to Article 71 (3), parliament made applicable rules/procedure to petition the supreme court for resolving the *disputes* only that arise during the election process of the president but not the *doubts* that arise from their unconstitutional actions/deeds or changing Indian citizenship during the tenure of the president which may violate the requisite election qualifications.[57]\n\n\nThe president may also be removed before the expiry of the term through impeachment for violating the Constitution of India by the Parliament of India. The process may start in either of the two houses of the parliament. The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one-quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the president and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration.\n\n\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the president has the right to defend himself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by the special majority again, the president stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.[58]\n\n\nUnder Article 361 of the constitution, though the president cannot be summoned for questioning except on their voluntary willingness to testify in the court in support of their controversial deeds, the unconstitutional decisions taken by the president would be declared invalid by the courts. The case would be decided by the courts based on the facts furnished by the Union government for the president's role. As clarified by the supreme court in the case *Rameshwar Prasad & Others vs Union of India & An Other* on 24 January 2006; though the president cannot be prosecuted and imprisoned during their term of office, they can be prosecuted after he/she steps down from the post for any guilt committed during the term of the presidency as declared earlier by the courts.[59] No president has resigned on impropriety to continue in office for declaring and nullifying their unconstitutional decisions by the courts till now. No criminal case at least on the grounds of disrespecting constitution is lodged till now against former presidents to punish them for their unconstitutional acts; though many decisions taken during the term of a president have been declared by the supreme court as unconstitutional, *mala fides*, void, *ultra vires*, etc.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Succession[edit]\n\n\nThe Office of the president falls vacant in the following scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. On the expiry of their term.\n2. By reason of death.\n3. By reason of resignation.\n4. Removal by the supreme court.\n5. Removal by impeachment.\n\n\nArticle 65 of the Indian constitution says that the Vice-President of India will have to discharge the duties, if the office falls vacant due to any reason other than the expiry of the term.[31]:\u200a20.10 The vice-president reverts to their office when a new president is elected and enters office. When the president is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the vice-president discharges the president's functions until the president resumes the duties.\n\n\nA vice-president who acts as or discharges the functions of the president has all the powers and immunities of the president and is entitled to the same emoluments as the president. When a vice-president discharges the duties of the president, he/she does not function as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.\n\n\nThe Indian parliament has enacted the law\u2014*The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969* \u2014[61] for the discharge of the functions of the president when vacancies occur in the offices of the president and the vice-president simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the chief justice\u2014or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of India available\u2014discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon their office or a newly elected vice-president begins to act as president under Article 65 of the constitution, whichever is the earlier.[22]:\u200a96 For example, in 1969, when President Zakir Husain died in Office, Vice-President V. V. Giri served as the acting president of India. However, later, V.V Giri resigned from both posts (Acting President of India and Vice-President of India) as he became a candidate in the 1969 presidential election in India. In this event, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah served as the acting president of India until the next president was elected.\n\n\n\n## President vs Chief Justice[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPresident versus Chief Justice of India\n| President | Chief Justice of India / judiciary\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| The duties of President under their oath is to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and the law | Similar to president to uphold the constitution and the laws (Third Schedule of the constitution)[8] |\n| The oath is taken in the presence of the chief justice | The oath is taken in the presence of the president\n |\n| Impeachment by parliament with a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of each house of the parliament for violation of the constitution as per Article 61. | Removal from office by each house of the parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that house and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that house present and voting on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity as per Article 124(4) |\n| President can be removed by the supreme court per Article 71(1) for committing electoral malpractices and upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be president. | President cannot remove judges once appointed by him without impeachment process per Article 124.\n |\n| An individual heads the autonomous institution of President. | Judiciary/supreme court is also an autonomous institution represented by a team of supreme court judges with chief justice as its chief.\n |\n| President being head of parliament, Executive and supreme commander of the armed forces, is fully empowered by the constitution to fulfil their judicial responsibility.

They are the foremost defender of the constitution who can pre-empt the unconstitutional activities of executive and legislatures. The other duties of President are just ceremonial as head of the country which are attached to him for being protector, defender and preserver of the constitution. The institution of President becomes redundant if the president is confined to other ceremonial duties only. | Can intervene or nullify the unlawful actions of union/state governments and unconstitutional laws enacted by the parliament or a state legislative after presidential assent only.\n |\n| President has constitutional immunity for their unconstitutional, *mala fides* activities during their tenure but is liable for judicial action/punishment for their unconstitutional activity after the term of their presidency. However, per Article 361 (1), President is answerable to a court designated by either house of the parliament with a two-thirds majority for the investigation of a charge against him under article 61. | Chief justice/judges of the supreme court are also immune from punishment for not delivering correct judgements or for their incompetence and mala fides. However, Judges' verdict can be repealed by a higher level bench of other judges.\n |\n| President cannot be recalled by the people of India for not fulfilling their constitutional duties in case parliament is not impeaching the president or removed by the supreme court. | Chief justice/judges of the supreme court also cannot be recalled by the people of India in case parliament is not impeaching the judges.\n |\n\n\n## President vs Prime minister[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPresident of India versus Prime Minister of India\n| President | Prime minister / Union cabinet\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| The duties of President under their oath is to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and the law | Swears allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, swears to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and swears to do right to all manner of people without fear or favour, affection or ill-will (Third Schedule of the constitution)[8] |\n| The oath is taken in the presence of the chief justice | The oath is taken in the presence of the president\n |\n| Elected in an extensive manner indirectly by the members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and state legislative assemblies in a secret ballot conducted by the Election Commission | Elected on the basis of majority of their political party or coalition in the Lok Sabha, through direct elections.\n |\n| Impeachment by parliament with a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of each house of the parliament for violation of the constitution as per Article 61 | Steps down upon losing majority support in Lok Sabha.\n |\n| President can be removed by the supreme court per Article 71(1) for committing electoral malpractices and upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be president | Similar to the prime minister and ministers also.\n |\n| An individual heads the autonomous institution of President | Union cabinet with Prime minister as its chief is collectively responsible.\n |\n| President being head of parliament, Executive and supreme commander of the armed forces, is fully empowered by the constitution to fulfil their judicial responsibility.

It is the President's duty to ensure that every state's governance is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the constitution under Articles 355 and 356 | Rest of the governance of the union and reporting to the president on all important matters. Being the leader of the majority/ ruling party in the parliament, the union cabinet takes lead in lawmaking by the parliament needed for policy finalisation on various aspects, annual budgets finalisation, planning and implementation, etc.\n |\n| President's prime function is to prevent unconstitutional decisions of union and state governments and parliament or state assemblies by denying their compulsory assent/government orders (GO) for making them into applicable laws. They are the foremost defender of the constitution who can pre-empt the unconstitutional activities of executive and legislatures. | Prime minister/Union cabinet shall aid and advise the president who shall, in the exercise of their functions, act in accordance with such advice as long as not unconstitutional. The prime minister shall communicate to the president all decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation and on President's desire submit related information. No minister shall decide on any matter without the council of ministers/ union cabinet approval per Article 78.\n |\n| President has constitutional immunity for their unconstitutional, mala fides activities during their tenure but liable for judicial action/punishment for their unconstitutional activity after the term of presidency | The union cabinet has constitutional immunity from legal proceedings in any court for their mala fide and unconstitutional advice tendered by union ministers to the president per Article 74 (2).\n |\n| President cannot escape from their constitutional duty by citing constitutional amendment to Article 74 (para 2 of 1) which makes him abide by the Union cabinet's advice after sending for reconsideration. As clarified by the supreme court, the object of Article 74 (2) is only to make the question whether the president had followed the advice of the union cabinet or acted contrary thereto, non-justiciable. Refer page Article 74#Court cases for more clarity | The union cabinet may escape from the punishment or responsibility for implementing unconstitutional laws citing Article 74 (2).\n |\n| President cannot be recalled by the people of India for not fulfilling their constitutional duties in case parliament is not impeaching the president or removed by the supreme court or resigns on their own on moral grounds | Prime minister/ union cabinet cannot be recalled by the people of India till the end of their term in case they lose majority support in Lok Shaba or resigns on their own on moral grounds.\n |\n\n\n## Important presidential interventions in the past[edit]\n\n\nThe president's role as defender of the constitution and the powers as Head of State, especially in relation to those exercised by the prime minister as leader of the government, have changed over time. In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.\n\n\n\n### Proving majority in the parliament[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vote of confidence\n\nIn 1979, Prime Minister Charan Singh, did not enjoy a parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament.[21] Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.\n\n\n\n### Proof of Majority to form a Government[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Vetoing of a Bill[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pocket veto and Zail Singh\n\nSince the Indian constitution does not provide any time limit within which the president is to declare their assent or refusal, the president could exercise a \"pocket veto\" by not taking any action for an indefinite time. The veto was used in 1986 by President Zail Singh over the Postal Bill. The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government arbitrary powers to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.[58][64][65]\n\n\n\n### Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqu\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, President K. R. Narayanan introduced a modicum of transparency and openness in the functioning of the President. This was by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqu\u00e9s explaining, to the nation, the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising their discretionary powers.[66]\n\n\n\n### Return of a Bill[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Office of profit\n\nThe constitution gives the president the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it. In mid-2006, President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of 'offices of profit', the holding of which would disqualify a person from being a member of parliament.[67] The combined opposition, the NDA, hailed the move. The UPA chose to send the bill back to the president without any changes and, after 17 days, Kalam gave his assent on 18 August 2006.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Sacking state governors[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Governors of states of India\n\nArunachal Pradesh governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, who was earlier appointed by the ruling party at the centre, was sacked by President Pranab Mukherjee after the Supreme Court struck down his unconstitutional acts.[70]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of presidents of India\n* Spouse of the President of India\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The president is the head of the executive as per Article 53 and 77 of the Indian Constitution. But in practice, it is the Council of Ministers with the prime minister as its head, that exercises the powers accorded to this position as per Article 74 and 78 of the Indian Constitution. Thus making the prime minister the *de facto* head of the executive.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"President Approves New Protocol Practice\". *pib.gov.in*.

United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\n\n\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section\u00a07 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.[18] In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\n\n\nThe president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[B] In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms.[C] Joe Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed office at noon EST on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## History and development[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, represented by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, declared themselves to be independent sovereign states and no longer under British rule. The affirmation was made in the Declaration of Independence, which was written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress.[20] Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British,[21] the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.[22] Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for ratification.[20]\n\n\nUnder the Articles, which took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the Confederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.[21] This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[21] The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a president of the United States in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.[23]\n\n\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.[20] By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.[20] Civil and political unrest loomed. Events such as the Newburgh Conspiracy and Shays' Rebellion demonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working.\n\n\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.[20][24]\n\n\nWhen the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.[20] New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.[20] It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged.\n\n\n\n### 1789\u20131933[edit]\n\n\n![](image)George Washington, the first president of the United States\nAs the nation's first president, George Washington established many norms that would come to define the office.[25][26] His decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy,[27] and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,[28] with John Adams defeating Thomas Jefferson in 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.[29] After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians James Madison and James Monroe would each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings until Adams' son John Quincy Adams won election in 1824 after the Democratic-Republican Party split.\n\n\nThe election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.[30] Jacksonian democracy sought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor, Martin Van Buren, became unpopular after the Panic of 1837,[31] and the death of William Henry Harrison and subsequent poor relations between John Tyler and Congress led to further weakening of the office.[32] Including Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.[33] The Senate played an important role during this period, with the Great Triumvirate of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun playing key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.[34][35]\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War has led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.[D] The circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,[36][37] and Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor Andrew Johnson lost all political support[38] and was nearly removed from office,[39] with Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general Ulysses S. Grant. After the end of Reconstruction, Grover Cleveland would eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900, William McKinley became the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\n\n\nAfter McKinley's assassination, Theodore Roosevelt became a dominant figure in American politics.[40] Historians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,[41] with some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor, William Howard Taft. The following decade, Woodrow Wilson led the nation to victory during World War I, although Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations was rejected by the Senate.[42] Warren Harding, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially Teapot Dome,[43] and Herbert Hoover quickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the Great Depression.[44]\n\n\n\n### Imperial presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Imperial presidency\n\n![](image)President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivers a radio address in 1933\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency.[45] Backed by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies.[46]:\u200a211\u201312 The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation.[46]:\u200a229\u2013231 Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership.[46]:\u200a269 His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, each served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the \"leader of the free world\",[47] while John F. Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise of television in the 1960s.[48][49]\n\n\nAfter Lyndon B. Johnson lost popular support due to the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon's presidency collapsed in the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.[50][51] These included the War Powers Resolution, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,[52][53] and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 that sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.[54] By 1976, Gerald Ford conceded that \"the historic pendulum\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \"disruptive\" erosion of his ability to govern.[55] Ford failed to win election to a full term and his successor, Jimmy Carter, failed to win re-election. Ronald Reagan, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help re-shape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.[56][57]\n\n\nWith the Cold War ending and the United States becoming the world's undisputed leading power,[58] Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama each served two terms as president. Meanwhile, Congress and the nation gradually became more politically polarized, especially following the 1994 mid-term elections that saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine filibusters in the Senate in recent decades.[59] Recent presidents have thus increasingly focused on executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.[60] Presidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.[E]\n\n\n\n### Critics of presidency's evolution[edit]\n\n\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive department.[61] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[62][63] unchecked, unbalanced,[64] and \"monarchist\" in nature.[65] In 2008 professor Dana D. Nelson expressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\".[66] She criticized proponents of the Unitary executive theory for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers\u2014such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements\u2014that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\".[66] Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\".[67]\n\n\n\n## Legislative powers[edit]\n\n\nArticle I, Section\u00a01 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause\u00a02 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\n\n\n\n### Signing and vetoing bills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the 1964 Civil Rights Act at the White House on July 2, 1964, as Martin Luther King Jr. and others look on.\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment Clause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill. The veto \u2013 or threat of a veto \u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\n\n\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\n\n\n\n1. Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill becomes law.\n2. Veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a two-thirds vote.\n3. Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a pocket veto.\n\n\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In *Clinton v. City of New York*, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n### Setting the agenda[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump delivers his 2018 State of the Union Address before Congress\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda. Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient\". This is done through the constitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\n\n\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally, he can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.[68] Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.[69]\n\n\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.[70]\n\n\n\n### Promulgating regulations[edit]\n\n\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of 'czars'\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\".[71] Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[72] This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.[73] Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an \"increasingly swollen executive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".[74]\n\n\n\n### Convening and adjourning Congress[edit]\n\n\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section\u00a03 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry S. Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the Turnip Day Session. In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Executive powers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Powers of the president of the United States\n\n> \n> Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*Nixon v. General Services Administration*, **433 U.S. 425 (1977)** (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)\n\nThe president is head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\".[77] The executive branch has over four million employees, including the military.[78]\n\n\n\n### Administrative powers[edit]\n\n\nPresidents make political appointments. An incoming president may make up to 4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and various officers, are among the positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation.[79][80]\n\n\nThe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.[81] However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.[82]\n\n\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the White House Office.\n\n\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various types of directives, such as presidential proclamation and executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[83] Even so, these directives are subject to judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Congress can overturn an executive order through legislation.\n\n\n\n### Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President George H. W. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev sign the 1990 Chemical Weapons Accord at the White House.\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\" This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy,[84] and to provide support for the president's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government.[85] The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\n\n\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution's adoption have increased presidential power. Where formerly ambassadors were vested with significant power to independently negotiate on behalf of the United States, presidents now routinely meet directly with leaders of foreign countries.\n\n\n\n### Commander-in-chief[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president who successfully preserved the Union during the American Civil War, with Union Army general George B. McClellan and soldiers at Antietam on October 3, 1862\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[86] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No. 69:\n\n\n> The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.\u00a0... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces\u00a0... while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which\u00a0... would appertain to the legislature.[87] [Emphasis in the original.]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the modern era, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[88] Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,[89][90] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903,[89] the Korean War,[89] the Vietnam War,[89] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[91] and Panama in 1989.[92]\n\n\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.[93] George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion, a conflict in Western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\", though James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.[94] Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the American Civil War, 1861\u20131865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.[95]\n\n\nThe present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is normally exercised through the secretary of defense. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).[96][97][98]\n\n\n\n### Juridical powers and privileges[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden with his Supreme Court appointee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and (in background) Vice President Kamala Harris following Brown Jackson's 2022 United States Senate confirmation\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office; this is often controversial.[99][100][101]\n\n\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in *United States v. Nixon*, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in *Clinton v. Jones*, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.[102]\n\n\nThe state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in *Totten v. United States* 92 U.S. 105 (1876), when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.[103] However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until *United States v. Reynolds* 345 U.S. 1 (1953), where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege.[104] Before the September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[105] Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in *Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.*[104][106][107] Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.[108][109]\n\n\nThe degree to which the president personally has absolute immunity from court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions. *Nixon v. Fitzgerald* (1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions. *Clinton v. Jones* (1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019 Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible obstruction of justice, but investigators declined to refer Donald Trump for prosecution based on a United States Department of Justice policy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the New York County District Attorney alleging violations of New York state law.[110]\n\n\n\n## Leadership roles[edit]\n\n\n### Head of state[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Woodrow Wilson throws out the ceremonial first ball on Opening Day in 1916.\n![](image)President Bill Clinton reviews honor guards at Buckingham Palace during a 1995 state visit to the UK.\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example, William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on the Washington Senators's Opening Day. Every president since Taft, except for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much fanfare.[113] Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has served as honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.[114]\n\n\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children.[115] Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.[116]\n\n\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition.[117] Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming president.[118]\n\n\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a \"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".[119] Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[120] One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \"in rich detail\" which \"drew on the power of myth\" regarding the incident of PT 109[121] and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.[122] As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Head of party[edit]\n\n\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party. Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\n\n### Global leader[edit]\n\n\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a natural-born citizen of the United States;\n* be at least 35 years old;\n* be a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.[124]\n\n\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\n\n\n\n* Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.[125][126]\n* Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.[127] There is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding Confederates from public office after the Civil War.[128]\n* Under the Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.[129][130]\n\n\n### Campaigns and nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States presidential primary and United States presidential nominating convention\n\nSee also: United States presidential debates\n\n![](image)President Jimmy Carter (left) debates Republican nominee Ronald Reagan on October 28, 1980, during the 1980 U.S. presidential campaign.\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer.[131]\n\n\nNominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.\n\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States presidential election\n\nSee also: United States Electoral College\n\n![](image)Map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated to each state and the District of Columbia following the 2010 census for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections; Maine and Nebraska distribute electors by way of the congressional district method. Of the 538 electoral votes possible, at least 270 votes are required for a majority.\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.[132] Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.[133] In all but two states, the party whose presidential\u2013vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.[134] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district.[135][136]\n\n\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are pledged.[137][138] The constitutionality of these laws was upheld in *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020).[139] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top *three* electoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a Candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[133]\n\n\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\u201373 electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the election of 1800 necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by Article II, Section 1, Clause\u00a03 of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the runner-up would become vice president.[140] On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.[141] A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.[142]\n\n\n\n### Inauguration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States presidential inauguration\n\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20.[143] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.[144] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[145]\n\n\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential Oath of Office, found in Article II, Section 1, Clause\u00a08 of the Constitution. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\n\n\n\n\n> I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.[146]\n> \n> \n\n\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me God\" to the end of the oath.[147][148] Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the chief justice of the United States.[146]\n\n\n\n## Incumbency[edit]\n\n\n### Term limit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President William McKinley and his vice president and presidential successor, Theodore Roosevelt, c.\u20091880\n![](image)Franklin D. Roosevelt won a record four presidential elections in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944 prior to the implementation of the 22nd amendment in 1951, which instituted a two-term limit\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe.[149] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.[150]\n\n\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression and focused on supporting U.S. allied nations at war with the Axis powers, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.[151]\n\n\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. Harry S. Truman, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term\u2014to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for re-election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term\u2014before he withdrew from the 1952 election.[151] Since becoming operative in 1951, the amendment has been applicable to six twice-elected presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n### Vacancies and succession[edit]\n\n\nUnder Section\u00a01 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\n\n\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession), Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, stated only that the vice president assumes the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.[152] Under this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply act as president,[153] potentially resulting in a special election. Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, Vice President John Tyler declared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \"Acting President\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\n\n\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\".[153] The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (codified as 3\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a019) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the presidential line of succession follows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of federal executive departments who form the president's cabinet. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.[154]\n\n\n\n### Declarations of inability[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting to the speaker of the House and the president *pro tempore* of the Senate a statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by Ronald Reagan (once), George W. Bush (twice), and Joe Biden (once), each in anticipation of surgery.[155][156]\n\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president *pro tempore* of the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\n\n\n\n### Removal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States, Federal impeachment in the United States, and Federal impeachment trial in the United States\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". Article I, Section 2, Clause\u00a05 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \"grand jury\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.[157] Article I, Section 3, Clause\u00a06 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.[158]\n\n\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019 and 2021; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee conducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in 1973\u201374 and reported three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.[157]\n\n\n\n### Circumvention of authority[edit]\n\n\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from Donald Trump's desk.[159] Decades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that left him partly incapacitated. First lady Edith Wilson kept this condition a secret from the public for a while, and controversially became the sole gatekeeper for access to the president (aside from his doctor), assisting him with paperwork and deciding which information was \"important\" enough to share with him.\n\n\n\n### Compensation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Presidential pay history\n |\n| --- |\n| Yearestablished | Salary | Salary in2021 USD\n |\n| 1789 | $25,000 | $568,625\n |\n| 1873 | $50,000 | $1,130,972\n |\n| 1909 | $75,000 | $2,261,944\n |\n| 1949 | $100,000 | $1,138,881\n |\n| 1969 | $200,000 | $1,477,858\n |\n| 2001 | $400,000 | $612,141\n |\n| Sources:[160][161] |\n\n\nSince 2001, the president's annual salary has been $400,000, along with a: $50,000 expense allowance; $100,000 nontaxable travel account, and $19,000 entertainment[*clarification needed*] account. The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause\u00a07 of the Constitution, any increase or reduction in presidential salary cannot take effect before the next presidential term of office.[162][163]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nFor the official residences in which President Washington resided, see Presidency of George Washington \u00a7\u00a0Residences. For the private residences of the various U.S. presidents, see List of residences of presidents of the United States.\n\nThe White House in Washington, D.C. is the official residence of the president. The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\". Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.[164] The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.[165]\n\n\nCamp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.[166]\n\n\nPresident's Guest House, located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House Complex and Lafayette Park, serves as the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. Four interconnected, 19th-century houses\u2014Blair House, Lee House, and 700 and 704 Jackson Place\u2014with a combined floor space exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500\u00a0m2) comprise the property.[167]\n\n\n\n* Presidential residences\n* ![White House, the official residence](image)\n\nWhite House, the official residence\n* ![Camp David in Frederick County, Maryland, the official retreat](image)\n\nCamp David in Frederick County, Maryland, the official retreat\n* ![Blair House, the official guest house](image)\n\nBlair House, the official guest house\n\n\n### Travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation of the president of the United States\n\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as *Air Force One* while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.[168][169]\n\n\nFor short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated *Marine One* when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats.\n\n\nFor ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which is an armored limousine designed to look like a Cadillac sedan, but built on a truck chassis.[170][171] The U.S. Secret Service operates and maintains the fleet of several limousines. The president also has access to two armored motorcoaches, which are primarily used for touring trips.[172]\n\n\n\n* Presidential transportation\n* ![The presidential limousine, dubbed \"The Beast\"](image)\n\nThe presidential limousine, dubbed \"The Beast\"\n* ![The presidential plane, called Air Force One when the president is on board](image)\n\nThe presidential plane, called Air Force One when the president is on board\n* ![The presidential helicopter, known as Marine One when the president is aboard](image)\n\nThe presidential helicopter, known as Marine One when the president is aboard\n\n\n### Protection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Secret Service\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan waves following his inauguration as the nation's 40th president on January 20, 1981.\nThe U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family. As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames.[173] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.[174]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Presidents George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter in the Oval Office on January 7, 2009; Obama took office thirteen days later.\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nSome former presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as chief justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after. Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt;[175] Herbert Hoover;[176] Richard Nixon;[177] and Jimmy Carter.[178][179]\n\n\nPresidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.[180][181] Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.[182] Jimmy Carter has become a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill Clinton has also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, from North Korea. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former Presidents Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. President Obama followed suit by asking Presidents Clinton and Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an earthquake devastated that country in 2010.\n\n\nClinton was active politically since his presidential term ended, working with his wife Hillary on her 2008 and 2016 presidential bids and President Obama on his 2012 reelection campaign. Obama was also active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president Joe Biden on his 2020 election campaign. Trump has continued to make appearances in the media and at conventions and rallies since leaving office.\n\n\n\n### Pension and other benefits[edit]\n\n\nThe Former Presidents Act (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses. The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff. The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by impeachment.[183]\n\n\nAccording to a 2008 report by the Congressional Research Service:[183]\n\n\n\n\n> Chief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\n> \n> \n\n\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.[184] Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.[185] The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and franking privileges.\n\n\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.[186][187] In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[188] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents.[189] A first spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.[188]\n\n\n\n### Presidential libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidential library system\n\n![](image)From left to right: Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter at the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas in 2013\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.[190] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\n\n\n\n* The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois;\n* The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Southern Methodist University;\n* The George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Texas A&M University; and\n* The Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document: \n\n\n\n* The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri;\n* The Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kansas;\n* The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California; and\n* The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California.\n\n\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.\n\n\n\n## Political affiliation[edit]\n\n\nPolitical parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation's history. Though the Founding Fathers generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"pro-administration\" and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party.[191]\n\n\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.[192][193] Since Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office.[194][195]\n\n\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Party\n | # | Name(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Republican | 19\n | Chester\u00a0A.\u00a0Arthur, George\u00a0H.\u00a0W.\u00a0Bush, George\u00a0W.\u00a0Bush, Calvin\u00a0Coolidge, Dwight\u00a0D.\u00a0Eisenhower, Gerald\u00a0Ford, James\u00a0A.\u00a0Garfield, Ulysses\u00a0S.\u00a0Grant, Warren\u00a0G.\u00a0Harding, Benjamin\u00a0Harrison, Rutherford\u00a0B.\u00a0Hayes, Herbert\u00a0Hoover, Abraham\u00a0Lincoln,[F] William\u00a0McKinley, Richard\u00a0Nixon, Ronald\u00a0Reagan, Theodore\u00a0Roosevelt, William\u00a0Howard\u00a0Taft, and Donald\u00a0Trump |\n|  | Democratic | 15\n | **Joe Biden (incumbent)**, James\u00a0Buchanan, Jimmy\u00a0Carter, Grover\u00a0Cleveland, Bill\u00a0Clinton, Andrew\u00a0Jackson, Lyndon\u00a0B.\u00a0Johnson, John\u00a0F.\u00a0Kennedy, Barack Obama, Franklin\u00a0Pierce, James\u00a0K.\u00a0Polk, Franklin\u00a0D.\u00a0Roosevelt, Harry\u00a0S.\u00a0Truman, Martin\u00a0Van\u00a0Buren, and Woodrow\u00a0Wilson |\n|  | Democratic-Republican | 4\n | John\u00a0Quincy\u00a0Adams, Thomas\u00a0Jefferson, James\u00a0Madison, and James\u00a0Monroe |\n|  | Whig | 4\n | Millard\u00a0Fillmore, William\u00a0Henry\u00a0Harrison, Zachary\u00a0Taylor, and John\u00a0Tyler[G] |\n|  | Federalist | 1\n | John\u00a0Adams |\n|  | National Union | 1\n | Andrew\u00a0Johnson[H] |\n|  | *None* | 1\n | George\u00a0Washington |\n\n\n## Timeline of presidents[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of the United States\n\nThe following timeline depicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of American politics\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The informal term POTUS originated in the Phillips Code, a shorthand method created in 1879 by Walter P.

Later, while president, Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner. Near the end of his presidency, Johnson rejoined the Democratic Party.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"How to Address the President; He Is Not Your Excellency or Your Honor, But Mr. President\". *The New York Times*.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \"pursuant\" to these triggering provisions.\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"The Law: The President's War Powers\". *Time*.

Use of the state secrets privilege in courts has grown significantly over the last twenty-five years. In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown. But the increase in reported cases is indicative of greater willingness to assert the privilege than in the past.\n106. **^** Savage, Charlie (September 8, 2010). \"Court Dismisses a Case Asserting Torture by C.I.A.\" *The New York Times*.

The president leads the executive branch of the Indonesian government and is the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Since 2004, the president and vice president are directly elected to a five-year term, once renewable, allowing for a maximum of 10 years in office.\n\n\nJoko Widodo is the seventh and current president of Indonesia. He assumed office on 20 October 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Sukarno era[edit]\n\n\nThe Indonesian presidency was established during the formulation of the 1945 Constitution by the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when Sukarno was elected by acclamation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the, \"the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI.\" Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), had not yet been formed.[3]:\u200a138 On 16 October 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.[3]:\u200a152 On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a de facto parliamentary democracy with the president as a ceremonial Head of State whose function was to ask the prime minister as the Head of the Government to form a new Cabinet.\n\n\nDuring the Indonesian National Revolution, both Sukarno and Hatta were captured by the Dutch in Yogyakarta on 18 December 1948. Sukarno then gave a mandate for Sjafruddin Prawiranegara to form an emergency government.[4] This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.[5] On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to Assaat.[6] When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a unitary state, Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.\n\n\nIndonesia now adopted the constitution that had been intended for RIS. Officially known as the Provisional Constitution, the document confirmed the president's role as the head of state, but limited him to a mostly ceremonial role. He appointed a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.[7]\n\n\nDespite his limited constitutional role, Sukarno commanded great moral authority. Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy. In the early 1950s, he began calling for the implementation of \"Guided Democracy,\" in which decisions would be made after lengthy deliberation with a view toward achieving a consensus under presidential \"guidance.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the decade saw a series of unstable governments. Taking advantage of the situation, Sukarno made a speech in April 1959 and suggested that Indonesia return to the 1945 Constitution.[8] The People reacted enthusiastically and there was strong pressure on the Constitutional Assembly, the body responsible for formulating a new constitution, to adopt the 1945 Constitution. When the assembly did not budge, Sukarno issued a presidential decree on 5 July 1959 declaring that Indonesia was returning to the 1945 Constitution.[8] That document made the president head of government as well as head of state. In May 1963, the People's Consultative Assembly appointed Sukarno president for Life.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, it did not mean that it was strictly adhered to. The MPR, which at this stage was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status. In 1967, Sukarno was forced to resign as president, and army chief of staff Suharto was appointed as acting president.\n\n\n\n### Suharto era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto was appointed president in his own right in 1968. During his rise to power, Suharto seemed determined to observe at least the forms of the constitution, and this continued when he became president. Under the constitution, the MPR was responsible for formulating the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN); as president, Suharto was responsible for implementing them. Suharto also made it a presidential obligation to deliver accountability speeches near the end of his terms. During the speech, Suharto outlined the achievements that his administration had made and how those achievements had adhered to the GBHN set by the MPR. Despite the constitutional and democratic fa\u00e7ade, Suharto made sure that the MPR was subservient to him. In 1969, a law was passed that required appointments to the MPR to be made official by the president.[10] He also took measures that largely emasculated the opposition parties. For example, he had the power to issue governmental regulations in lieu of law. Nominally, if these regulations were not approved by the House of People's Representatives (DPR, the pre-2004 legislative branch), they were considered revoked. However, given the DPR's infrequent sessions and the near-total dominance of the pro-government political grouping, Golkar, such approval was a mere formality. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Suharto ruled by decree for most of his tenure. For the better part of Suharto's rule, he effectively held all governing power in the nation.\n\n\n\n### Reform era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto fell from power in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, B. J. Habibie had his only accountability speech rejected.[11] Abdurrahman Wahid then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.[12]\n\n\nDuring the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.[13] In response to Sukarno and Suharto's abuses of power, other amendments passed at that session hedged the presidency about with numerous checks and balances to prevent another president from completely dominating the system. For example, the president was limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. He also lost the right to legislate, but could propose legislation.\n\n\nIn 2004 election, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. He was re-elected in 2009. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.\n\n\nThe 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law Prabowo Subianto against the governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, Jusuf Kalla, were sworn in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.\n\n\n\n## Requirements to run for office[edit]\n\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen in another nation, has not betrayed the nation, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the duties. Amended Constitution also states that further criteria will be determined by laws.

If the president is viewed to have violated the law in the form of treason against the state, corruption, bribery, other serious crimes, or disgraceful acts, and/or no longer meets the requirements to be president, the DPR can ask the Constitutional Court to look into the matter, during which it has 90 days to make a decision.

If the Constitutional Court decides that the president has violated the law, the DPR can motion for the MPR to convene. The president would then be given one last chance to defend himself before the MPR makes the decision whether or not the president should be impeached. The decision of the MPR to dismiss the President and/or the Vice President is made with the approval of at least 2/3 of the members of the MPR who are present at the session which is attended by at least 3/4 of all members of the MPR (at least 50% of the total members of the MPR).\n\n\n**The Original 1945 Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\n**The 1950 Provisional Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\nAlthough there is no article about president (and vice president) impeachment in the original 1945 Constitution, Sukarno and Abdurrahman Wahid were still impeached in 1967 and 2001.

The president is the nominal head of the executive and the supreme commander of the Pakistan Armed Forces.[4][5] Arif Alvi is the 13th and current president, in office since 9 September 2018.\n\n\nThe office of president was created upon the proclamation of Islamic Republic on 23 March 1956. The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits the president from directly running the government.[7] Instead, the executive power is exercised on his behalf by the prime minister who keeps him informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy, as well as all legislative proposals.[8] The Constitution however, vests the president with the powers of granting pardons, reprieves, and the control over military; however, all appointments at higher commands of the military must be made by the President on a \"required and necessary\" basis, upon consultation and approval from the prime minister.[9]\n\n\nThe president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College for a five-year term. The Constitution requires the president to be a \"Muslim of not less than forty five (45) years of age\". The president resides in an estate in Islamabad known as Aiwan-e-Sadar (President's House). In his absence, the chairman of Senate exercises the responsibilities of the post, until the actual president resumes office, or the next office holder is elected.\n\n\nThere have been a total of 13 presidents. The first president was Iskander Ali Mirza who entered office on 23 March 1956. The current office holder is Dr Arif Alvi, who took charge on 9 September 2018, following his victory in the 2018 elections.\n\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\n### Role of the president[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ceremonial guard of honour at the *Aiwan-e-Sadr*.\nThe official residence and principal workplace of the president is Aiwan-e-Sadr\u2014 the presidential palace located in northeastern Islamabad. The presidency forms the vital institutional organ of state and is part of the bicameral Parliament.[10]\n\n\nPowers to exercise the authority are limited to the ceremonial figurehead, and required to address the Parliament to give a direction for national policies before being informed of its key decisions.[11][12][13]\n\n\nIn addition, the president is also a civil commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces, with chairman joint chiefs being its chief military adviser to maintain the civilian control of the Pakistani military.[14] After a thorough confirmation comes from the prime minister, the president confirms the judicial appointments in the national court system.[15][16] In addition, the Constitution allows the president to grant pardons, reprieves, and clemency in cases recommended to him by the executive and the judiciary.[17] The president himself has absolute constitutional immunity from criminal and civil proceedings, and no proceedings can be initiated or continued against him during the term of his office.[18]\n\n\n\n\n> There shall be a President of Pakistan who shall be the Head of State and shall represent the \"unity of the Republic.\"\n> \n> \u2014\u200aArticle 41 in Chapter 1: The President of Part III: The Federation of Pakistan in the Constitution of Pakistan, source[19]\n> \n\n\n## Legastlative Powers[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Article 50 of the Constitution the Parliament of Pakistan consists of the President and two Houses known as the National Assembly and the Senate.\n\n\nAccording to Constitution Of Pakistan,every bill becomes act only when President assented it or deemed to be assented after passage of certain time according to constitution.\n\n\nHe can prorogue and summon sessions of Parliament both National Assembly and Senate.\n\n\nThe President may address either House or both Houses of Parliament jointly and may for that purpose oblige the attendance of the Members.\n\n\nThe president has the right to speak in parliament.\n\n\nThe president may send a message about a Bill pending in the parliament.

Even the salaries may be required to be reduced.\n\n\nPresident can impose governor rule in any province. He can run provincial government directly.\n\n\nHe can use emergency powers on advice of Prime Minister and cabinet.\n\n\nFrom 2000 until 2009, the president was the chairman of the National Security Council who had authority and control over the nuclear and strategic arsenals; however, the chairmanship and the powers transferred back to the prime minister.[20] Furthermore, the presidential powers have significantly declined with Pakistan's government reversed to a parliamentary democratic republic.[21]\n\n\n\n### Eligibility and selection process[edit]\n\n\nThe Constitution of Pakistan sets the principle qualifications that the candidate must meet to be eligible to the office of the president.[22] A president has to be:\n\n\n\n* A citizen of Pakistan[5]\n* A Muslim[22]\n* At least 45 years of age[22]\n* Qualified to be elected as member of the National Assembly[22]\n\n\nWhenever the *Aiwan-e-Sadr* becomes vacant, the selection of president is done by the electoral college, which consists of both houses of Parliament (the Senate and National Assembly) and the four provincial assemblies.[23] The chief election commissioner has to conduct elections to the office of the president in a special session.[24] Voting takes place in secrecy.[25]\n\n\nEach elector casts a different number of votes.[25] The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by members of Parliament equals the total number of votes cast by provincial legislators.[25] Each of the provincial legislatures has an equal number of votes to each other, based on the number of members of the smallest legislature, which is the Balochistan Assembly (65 seats).[25]\n\n\nThe constitution further states that election to the office of president will not be held earlier than sixty days and not later than thirty days before the expiration of the term of the president in office.[25]\n\n\n\n### Election and oath[edit]\n\n\nThe president is elected indirectly for a term of five years.[26] The incumbent president is eligible for re-election to that office, but cannot hold that office for more than two consecutive terms.[27] The president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the chief justice\u2014, an oath or affirmation that the president shall protect, preserve and defend the Constitution as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> I, (The name of the President-elect), do solemnly swear that I am a Muslim and believe in the Unity, and Oneness of Almighty Allah, the Books of Allah, the *Holy Qur'an* being the last of them, the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last of the Prophets and that there can be no Prophet after him, the Day of Judgment, and all the requirements and teachings of the Holy Quran and *Sunnah*:\n> \n> \n> That I will bear true faith and allegiance to Pakistan:\n> \n> \n> That, as President of Pakistan, I will discharge my duties, and perform my functions, honestly, to the best of my ability, faithfully in accordance with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the law, and always in the interest of the sovereignty, integrity, solidarity, well- being and prosperity of Pakistan:\n> \n> \n> That I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions:\n> \n> \n> That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan:\n> \n> \n> That, in all circumstances, I will do right to all manner of people, according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill- will:\n> \n> \n> And that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as President of Pakistan, except as may be required for the due discharge of my duties as President.\n> \n> \n> \n> May Allah Almighty help and guide me (Ameen).[28]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Line of succession and removal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Line of succession to the President of Pakistan\n\nThe Constitution discusses the possibility of an acting president.[29] Certain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates in case of vacancy as the constitution does not include a position of vice president:\n\n\n\n* The chairman of the Senate of Pakistan\n* The speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan.[30]\n\n\nThe president may be removed before the expiry of the term through impeachment. The president can be removed for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.[31]\n\n\nThe impeachment process may start in either of the two houses of the Parliament. The house initiates the process by leveling the charges against the president.[32] The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by either the chairman or the speaker of the National Assembly through a two-thirds majority.[32] The notice is sent up to the president, and 14 days later it is taken up for consideration.[33]\n\n\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by the two-thirds majority.[34] The speaker of the National Assembly then summons the joint session not earlier than seven days.[35] The president has the right to defend oneself.[36]\n\n\nIf the resolution is passed by the two-thirds majority at the joint session declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross misconduct, then the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.[37]\n\n\nNo president has been impeached. However, the proceedings have been used in 2008 in an attempt to impeach former president Pervez Musharraf who tendered the resignation after the proceedings above were used.[38]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of presidents of Pakistan and List of heads of state of Pakistan\n\n## Political background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1956\u20131967)\n### Early origins[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1947 until 1956, the governor-general of Pakistan acted for the head of state: King George VI (until 1952) and Queen Elizabeth II (from 1952). With the promulgation of the first constitution, Pakistan became an Islamic republic in 1956, and the governor-general was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent governor-general, Iskander Mirza, became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly suspended the first constitution in 1958, and appointed Army commander-in-chief General Ayub Khan as the first chief martial law administrator. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iskander Mirza became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956\nThe second constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a presidential republic without direct elections. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide presidential election in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, Fatima Jinnah, for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Ayub Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)\nControversy regarding the U-2 incident (1960), privatization (1963), and war with India (1965), fueled a fierce left-wing opposition movement led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the PPP and Bengali nationalist Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from paralysis and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General Yahya Khan, who imposed martial law and announced that national elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, general elections were held in 1970 which saw the PPP gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current-day Pakistan) and the Awami League gaining a majority in East Pakistan (current-day Bangladesh).\n\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited Nurul Amin of the Pakistan Muslim League to become the prime minister, and also appointed him as the first vice president. The growing instigated violence against Pakistanis in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use force in order to maintain order there, which further escalated Bengali resistance (1970). Preemptive strikes against India led to another war in 1971, which freed East Pakistan and created Bangladesh.\n\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of Pakistan after the fall of East Pakistan, President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. President Bhutto created the current Constitution of Pakistan in 1973, transforming Pakistan into a parliamentary democracy, and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial figurehead.\n\n\n\n### Past Interventions[edit]\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the right-wing alliance, the Pakistan National Alliance. The events leading to it resulted in military intervention by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq and Chairman Joint Chiefs Admiral Mohammad Shariff. Suspending the Constitution in 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's presidency oversaw the modern growth of far-right ideas in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the Constitution, President Zia-ul-Haq held a referendum (1984) and called for general elections in 1985. President Zia-ul-Haq appointed Mohammad Junejo as prime minister and assumed more powers through the constitutional amendment. After dismissing Prime Minister Junejo, President Zia-ul-Haq announced that new general elections would be held, but President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988.\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1988 witnessed the victory of PPP in 1988 and appointed Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan to the presidency. The conflict between Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan repeatedly intervened in government matters and leveled charges against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; thus dismissing Prime Minister Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990. After holding general elections in 1990, Nawaz Sharif brought up an ideologically conservative government and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by Supreme Court and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shamim Allam, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tendered resignations in 1993.\n\n\nFollowing the new elections held in 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto established a strong government after appointing loyalist Farooq Leghari to the presidency. However, the corruption charges and the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 resulted in President Farooq Leghari dismissing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In 1997, President Farooq Leghari could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the public in 1997. President Leghari unsuccessfully supported Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the Judiciary, the Executive, and the Parliament. After appointing Rafiq Tarar, the Parliament successfully passed constitutional amendment to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial self coup in 1999, General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar in 2001 while assuming more powers to the presidency. In January 2004, the Electoral College elected Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".[39]\n\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the Judiciary, and declared a state of emergency in 2007, after dismissing the senior justices of the Supreme Court. Although Musharraf was elected in 2007, the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious. A populist constitutional movement eventually resulted in Musharraf's departure. On 22 August 2008, the electoral commission called for presidential nominations to be delivered by 26 August 2008 and for elections to be held on 6 September 2008.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Figurehead overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Arif Alvi visits Maritime Ministry, flanked by Ali Zaidi and Rizwan Ahmed\nAfter the presidential election held in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari lobbied for constitutional amendment to restore the Constitution as it was in 1973.[42][43][44][45] In 2010, the Parliament unanimously and with a large majority, passed the eighteenth amendment of the constitution. It revoked the presidential powers and changed Pakistan from a semi-presidential system of government to a parliamentary republic, with great hopes of governmental stability in the future.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Principal Secretary to the President of Pakistan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Prime Minister of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court\n* Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army\n* Constitution of Pakistan\n* Foreign Minister of Pakistan\n* Finance Minister of Pakistan\n* Interior Minister of Pakistan\n* Minister of Defence (Pakistan)\n* Vice President of Pakistan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gupta, K.
