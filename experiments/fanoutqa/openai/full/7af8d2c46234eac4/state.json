The UT System's $30 billion endowment (as of the 2019 fiscal year) is the largest of any public university system in the United States.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Component institutions[edit]\n\n\n![University of Texas System is located in Texas](image)![UT Arlington](image)\nUT Arlington\n![UT Austin](image)\nUT Austin\n![UT Dallas](image)\nUT Dallas\n![UT El Paso](image)\nUT El Paso\n![UT Rio Grande Valley](image)\nUT Rio Grande Valley\n![UT San Antonio](image)\nUT San Antonio\n![UT Tyler](image)\nUT Tyler\n![UT Permian Basin](image)\nUT Permian Basin\n![UT Southwestern](image)\nUT Southwestern\n![UTMB - Galveston](image)\nUTMB - Galveston\n![UT HSC - Houston](image)\nUT HSC - Houston\n![UT HSC - San Antonio](image)\nUT HSC - San Antonio\n![UT MD Anderson](image)\nUT MD Anderson\n![SFA](image)\nSFA\nInstitutions\nUniversity of Texas System (Texas)\n\n### Academic institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Texas System has nine universities that each confers its own degrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Joinedsystem\n | Enrollment(Fall 2017 except as noted) | Nickname\n | Athleticconference\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stephen F.

Austin State University[edit]\n\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the Board of Regents of Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) announced their decision to accept an invitation to join the UT System. This decision occurred following an announcement at the start of the fall semester by SFA President Steve Westbrook that the board was considering joining a system. At the time, Stephen F. Austin was one of two independent public universities in Texas, alongside Texas Southern University. The Texas A&M University System, the Texas Tech University System, and the Texas State University System all extended invitations as well. The decision to join the UT System was made following a process that included faculty, staff, student, and alumni input.[5] Stephen F. Austin's addition to the UT System was approved by the Texas Legislature during the 2023 session. The identically worded House and Senate bills that would formally add SFA to the UT System specified that SFA would retain its name, but with the phrase \"a member of The University of Texas System\" appended to the legal school name. They also stated that SFA would be technically dissolved and then immediately reconstituted as a member of the UT System.[36] The Senate unanimously passed its bill on April 16, 2023,[37] and the House passed its version on April 26.[38] Governor Greg Abbott signed the measure into law on May 10.[39]\n\n\n\n#### UT Brownsville and UT Pan American (UTRGV) merger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a law officially approving the creation of a new university in South Texas within the UT System and replacing UT Brownsville and UT Pan American. The initiative resulted in a single institution, including a medical school, spanning the entire Rio Grande Valley, with a presence in each of the major metropolitan areas of Brownsville, Edinburg, Harlingen, and McAllen. On December 12, 2013, the UT Board of Regents voted to name the new university the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.[40] The new university began full operation in the 2015\u201316 school year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Founded\n | Joinedsystem\n | Merged\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas at Brownsville | UTB\nUT Brownsville\n | Brownsville | 1973\n | 1991\n | 2015(merged to form The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley) | [41][42] |\n| The University of Texas\u2013Pan American | UTPA\nUT Pan American\n | Edinburg | 1927\n | 1989\n | [43][44] |\n\n\n#### UT Tyler and UTHSC Tyler merger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Texas at Tyler\n\nIn December 2019, the UT System Board of Regents unanimously agreed to merge The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (UTHSCT) under The University of Texas at Tyler (UTT), creating a single unified institution.[45] Two months later, the UT System formally announced its intention to establish a new medical school that will be added under the new unified UT Tyler administration.[46] It will be the first medical school in the East Texas region.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Schools approved a plan to merge UT Tyler and UTHSCT. UTHSCT will retain its status as a health-related institution but will now come under the administration of UT Tyler. The UT System Board of Regents met in late December 2020 and took action on the implementation of the merger which began on January 1, 2021.[47]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Regents installed Kirk A. Calhoun, M.D. as president of the newly aligned UT Tyler and UTHSCT. As of January 4, these two institutions are officially one. On January 15, 2021 the institution publicly named the new line of executive leadership for the merged institution.[48]\n\n\nThe medical school is expected to open in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Founded\n | Joinedsystem\n | Merged\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas at Tyler | UTT\nUT Tyler\n | Tyler | 1971\n | 1979\n | 2021(merged as The University of Texas at Tyler) | [49][32] |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler | UTHSCT\nUT Health Tyler\n | Tyler | 1943\n | 1977\n | [50][51] |\n\n\n### Health institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Texas System has 5 independent health institutions. None are officially associated with any of the 4-year academic institutions, though some may have close relationships or special joint programs with them due to geographical location (Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area institutions & San Antonio institutions) or historical relationships (UT Austin & UT Medical Branch at Galveston).\n\n\nUT MD Anderson Cancer Center is one of the six schools at UT Health Science Center at Houston. Despite being officially associated under UT Houston, the UT System lists MD Anderson as a separate health institution due to its unique specialization.\n\n\nAdditionally, there are medical schools at UT Austin and UT Rio Grande Valley that are not directly affiliated with any of the independent health institutions.[52] The third medical school organized under an academic institution in the UT System will open in 2023 under the UT Tyler administration.\n\n\n\n#### Independent UT Health institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Medical school\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio | UTHSA or\nUTHSCSA\nUT Health San Antonio\n | Long School of Medicine | San Antonio (main), Laredo | 1959\n | [53][54] |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston | UTH\nUTHealth or\nUT Houston\n | McGovern Medical School | Houston | 1972\n | [55] |\n| The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center | UTMDACC\nMD Anderson\n | N/A (associated with UTH)\n | Houston (main), Katy, League City,\nMemorial City, Sugar Land, The Woodlands\n | 1941\n | [56] |\n| The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston | UTMB\nUT Galveston\n | John Sealy School of Medicine\n | Galveston | 1891\n | [57] |\n| The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center | UTSW\nUT Southwestern\n | UTSW Medical School\n | Dallas (main), Fort Worth,\nFrisco, Irving, Richardson\n | 1943\n | [58][59] |\n\n\n#### Medical schools within academic institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Medical school\n | Academic institution affiliation\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dell Medical School | UT Austin | Austin | 2013\n | [60] |\n| UTRGV School of Medicine | UT Rio Grande Valley | Harlingen (main), Brownsville, Edinburg | 2013\n | [61] |\n| UT Tyler School of Medicine\\*\n(\\**In Development, Projected Opening 2023*)\n | UT Tyler | Tyler | 2023\n | [62] |\n\n  \n\n\n* ![UT Health Science Center - Houston](image)\n\nUT Health Science Center - Houston\n* ![UT Health Science Center - San Antonio](image)\n\nUT Health Science Center - San Antonio\n* ![UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)](image)\n\nUT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)\n* ![UT Medical Branch at Galveston](image)\n\nUT Medical Branch at Galveston\n* ![UT Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX)](image)\n\nUT Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX)\n\n\n#### Attempted academic and health institutions and mergers[edit]\n\n\n**Dallas\u2013Fort Worth**\n\n\nIn 2001 the 77th Texas Legislature proposed HB 3568, which would have merged all Dallas\u2013Fort Worth UT System institutions (UT Dallas, UT Arlington, and UT Southwestern) under the name \"*The University of Texas at Dallas*\". UTD's Richardson campus would have been designated as the main campus, UTA's Arlington campus would have become a satellite campus, and UTSW's Dallas campus would have become the merged university's medical school.[63] The purpose was to help the metroplex gain one unified flagship-level university, but the House Bill ultimately failed to pass due to objections from UT Arlington (which wanted to retain its identity as a separate university) and the lack of time to properly explain the complex process to state representatives.[64]\n\n\n**San Antonio**\n\n\nNine years later, in 2010, a study was commissioned to explore the possibility of merging UT San Antonio and UT Health San Antonio.[65] Officials ultimately decided against it, citing significant costs, administrative challenges, and different university cultures.[66] In 2016, an op-ed published in the San Antonio Express-News urged the UT System Board of Regents to reconsider their decision, but no further actions from the UT System have been taken since.[67]\n\n\n**Houston**\n\n\nIn 2015, the UT System purchased 300 acres of land in the Houston area for $215 million for the development of a research campus, spearheaded by then-Chancellor William H. McRaven.[68] While the UT System publicly denied plans to build a new university on the land, the land acquisition drew criticism from the University of Houston System and several Texas State Senators, notably John Whitmire, focusing on the UT System encroaching on the UH System, given the UT System's access to the Permanent University Fund, as well as the process by which the land was purchased.[69] In 2017, the UT System announced it would be cancelling plans for the Houston campus.[70][71]\n\n\n\n## Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRacial and/or ethnic background (2015)\n|  | Students[72] | Texas[73] | United States[74] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Asian** | 11% | 5% | 6%\n |\n| **Black** | 7% | 13% | 13%\n |\n| **Hispanic** (of any race, includes Tejanos and White Hispanics)\n | 39% | 39% | 18%\n |\n| **Non-Hispanic White** | 30% | 43% | 61%\n |\n| **International student** | 9% | N/A | N/A\n |\n| **Other races or unknown** | 4% | 3% | N/A\n |\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters\nThe administrative offices are in Downtown Austin.[75] The UT system approved moving the system headquarters in November 2012.[76] Bonds from the UT System's endowment funded the construction of the new 19-story, 330,000-square-foot (31,000\u00a0m2) headquarters, which had a price tag of $102 million. The UT System planned to lease a portion of the facility for shops and other offices, with the approximately 200,000-square-foot (19,000\u00a0m2) remaining portion used for its own employees.[77] The system headquarters opened on August 1, 2017.[78]\n\n\nIn July 2018, the Pentagon announced it had selected the UT System administrative building as the headquarters for the Army Futures Command, a new organization committed to coordinating modernization efforts and integrating innovation across the Army.\n\n\nThe University of Texas System was previously headquartered in O. Henry Hall in Downtown Austin.[79] The system headquarters complex previously included multiple buildings, which had 550 employees in 2014.[77] These facilities included O. Henry Hall, Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall (named after Lady Bird Johnson), Ashbel Smith Hall, the Colorado Building, and the Lavaca Building,\n\n\nIn 2013 the UT system approved the demolitions of the Colorado Building and the Lavaca Building,[76] and the new UT System headquarters was built where these buildings previously stood.[77] The Texas State University System purchased O. Henry Hall in 2015 for $8.2 million;[76] the UT System leased it and continued using it as its administrative headquarters prior to the 2017 completion of the UT System's current headquarters.[80] The UT System leased the land containing Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall and Ashbel Smith Hall to Trammell Crow[76] which is constructing a commercial property on the site that uses the facade of Johnson Hall. Ashbel Smith Hall was imploded on March 25, 2018.[81]\n\n\n\n## Coordinated Admissions Program[edit]\n\n\nThe Coordinated Admissions Program (CAP) offers some UT Austin applicants the chance to attend the university if they complete their freshman year at another system school and meet specified requirements.[82] Each institution in the University of Texas System sets its own admissions standards, and not all schools may accept a particular CAP student.[82]\n\n\nUT Dallas does not participate in the CAP program, and University of Texas at San Antonio, the largest recipient of CAP students, has stated that it will be phasing out the program within the next ten years.[83][84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Permanent University Fund\n* Education in Texas\n* University of Texas at Austin admissions controversy\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment over $1 billion\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Seal of the University\". *University of Texas System*.

For other people with similar names, see James Milliken.\n\n\n**James Butler Milliken** (August 7, 1900 \u2013 August 11, 1988) was an American jurist and Democratic politician who served as a judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals for 24 years from 1951 to 1975. During his period of service, the Court of Appeals was the highest court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Supreme Court was not created until 1975, the year Milliken retired. He served three terms as chief justice, 1956\u201357, 1963\u201364 and, 1971\u201373.\n\n\nMilliken was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1900, grew up in Bellevue, Kentucky and graduated from Centre College where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1926. After two years at Yale, he returned home to teach math and English at Dayton (Kentucky) High School where he was also coach of the basketball team. In addition to teaching and coaching, he attended classes at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, eventually returning to Yale to graduate. He began his practice of law in Cincinnati and Campbell County, Kentucky where he became city attorney of Southgate, Kentucky. He later became a Kentucky State Representative and served as Chairman of the Kentucky Workers Compensation Board.\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the Court of Appeals, Milliken was an advocate for judicial reform and modernization. He was instrumental in bringing about a judicial retirement system in Kentucky and in the formation of the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n\n\nAfter his retirement from the bench on January 6, 1975, he taught constitutional law at the Salmon P. Chase College of Law and was given Chase's Distinguished Service Award.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* James B.

He is the former chancellor of the City University of New York, the largest urban university system in the U.S. from 2014 to 2018, after serving as president of the University of Nebraska from 2004 to 2014, where he was also a professor at the School of Public Affairs and at the College of Law.[1] He served as senior vice president of the University of North Carolina's 16-campus system from 1998 to 2004. Before his career in academic administration, Milliken practiced law in New York City.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMilliken was raised in Fremont, Nebraska. He received his bachelor of arts degree with distinction from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, in 1979. While at Nebraska, Milliken was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[4]\n\n\nAfter graduating from UNL, he spent a year working in Washington, D.C. as legislative assistant to Congresswoman Virginia D. Smith, R-Neb, who represented Nebraska's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991.[5] Milliken earned a J.D.[6] degree in 1983 from New York University School of Law; he was a Root-Tilden Scholar and research assistant to Professor Norman Dorsen, then-president of the American Civil Liberties Union. After graduating from NYU Law, Milliken worked for the Legal Aid Society's Civil Division in New York City, then as an attorney at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nMilliken was named Chancellor of the University of Texas System in August, 2018. The UT System Board of Regents touted Milliken's rich higher education experience over three decades and his track record of success in creating and executing strategic plans. [8]\n\n\nIn a radio interview with KUT in October, 2022, Milliken announced that the UT System had exceeded enrollment of 244,000 students,system-wide, for the first time in history. Milliken credited the system's enrollment growth to improved access through the UT Regents' Promise Plus endowment. Launched in 2022, Promise Plus is a $300 million endowment that was created by the UT System regents in order to reduce the cost of higher education for lower income students. The fund covers tuition at seven UT System universities and complements a similar need-based financial aid program at the University of Texas at Austin. [9]\n\n\nUnder Millken's watch as UT Chancellor the board of regents also invested in student well-being, approving a $16.5 million investment to \"expand and improve student mental health services, student safety and alcohol education resources\" at UT's 13 institutions. [10]\n\n\nPrior to his arrival in Texas, Milliken returned to his native Nebraska in 1988 where he accepted the position of executive assistant to the president of the University of Nebraska, and he was subsequently appointed Secretary to the Board of Regents and Vice President for External Affairs.[11]\n\n\nIn 1998, Milliken was appointed by then-president of the University of North Carolina, Molly Corbett Broad to lead university-wide strategy, institutional research, state and federal relations, public affairs, and economic development.[12] In 2000, Milliken helped pass a statewide referendum for a $3.1 billion bond issue for university and community college facilities.[13]\n\n\nMilliken was appointed president of the University of Nebraska in 2004. He worked to expand access and launched CollegeBound Nebraska, which provided free tuition to Nebraska Pell Grant recipients, University of Nebraska Online Worldwide, and Nebraska Innovation Campus, a public-private research and development park located on the former state fair grounds next to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus.[14][2] He subsequently led a $1.8 billion capital campaign,[15] funding new institutes for early childhood (Buffett Early Childhood Institute), global food and water sustainability (Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute) and rural sustainability (Rural Futures Institute).[2] Milliken also helped lead the Nebraska P-16 Initiative to improve primary education and increase college preparation.[16] He expanded the University's global reach, establishing new programs, with universities, the private sector and government, in China, India, Brazil and Turkey.\n\n\nMilliken became Chancellor of the City University of New York in 2014, and held the position through 2018.[17] While at CUNY, Milliken was lauded for improving access to higher education and expanded an initiative called ASAP, or Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, that provided financial help, including free MetroCard fare, and tutors. CUNY's graduation rates climbed and gained national recognition for the ASAP program. [18] In November 2016, an interim report of an investigation conducted by the office of New York State Inspector General found \"financial waste and abuse\", citing shoddy oversight and mismanagement that created a system ripe for financial waste and abuse, and criticized Milliken and CUNY General Counsel Frederick Schaffer, among others.[19][20] The 2016 report was based on findings that pre-dated Milliken's time as chancellor of CUNY and a group of New York city council members suggested New York State Governor Andrew Cuomowas using the report to politicize the system. [21] During the year preceding Milliken's resignation due to health concerns, Cuomo replaced CUNY Board of Trustees chairmen Benno C. Schmidt Jr. with a new chairmen Bill Thompson, and nearly all of the members of CUNY's board of trustees with a new politically prominent bloc. [22]\n\n\nMilliken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,[23] Business Higher Education Forum,[24] and on the executive committee of the Council on Competitiveness.[25] He formerly served as a director on the board of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and led the Commission on Innovation, Competition and Economic Prosperity.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSince 1989, Milliken has been married to Nana Graves Hilliard Smith, a graduate of Yale University, and New York University School of Law.[27] They have three children.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Who's Who in the Midwest, 38th, 39th Editions; Who's Who in America, 66th, 67th, 68th Editions\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Perry, Kate Howard (January 15, 2014). \"Leaving NU: J.B.

The president is chosen by the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, as provided for in the Constitution of the State of Michigan. Fifteen people\u2014fourteen men and one woman\u2014have held the office, in addition to several others who have held it in either an acting or interim capacity.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan's current president is Santa Ono, formerly the president of the University of British Columbia in Canada. He took office on 14 October 2022.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe office was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.[3] The precise wording has evolved through subsequent state constitutions, and as of November 2018 the office is defined by Article VIII, section 5 of the Constitution of 1963:[4] \n\n\n> The regents of the University of Michigan and their successors in office shall constitute a body corporate known as the Regents of the University of Michigan; ... Each board shall, as often as necessary, elect a president of the institution under its supervision. He shall be the principal executive officer of the institution, be ex-officio a member of the board without the right to vote and preside at meetings of the board. ...\n> \n> \n\n\nBetween the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; by law, they were supposed to appoint a chancellor to administer the university, but they never did, and a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administrative duties instead.[5]\n\n\nWhile the modern office was created in 1850, the University of Michigan itself now traces its date of founding to 1817, when its precursor, the University of Michigania, was founded. The only president of that institution, Rev. John Monteith, appears in the list of presidents but is not officially considered to have been a president of the University of Michigan.[6]\n\n\n\n## List of University of Michigan presidents[edit]\n\n\nThe first president of the university was Henry Philip Tappan. The position had originally been offered to Henry Barnard, but he declined, and Tappan and John Hiram Lathrop (then Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison) were nominated as new choices, after which Tappan was unanimously elected. Barnard later succeeded Lathrop at Wisconsin.\n\n\nThe 15th and most recent president of the university is Santa Ono, appointed in 2022. \nOf the previous presidents: \n\n\n\n* 1 had the office abolished\n* 1 died in office\n* 2 were removed by the regents\n* 5 retired at the end of their careers\n* 2 resigned to return to teaching or research\n* 4 resigned to take posts at other institutions (Northwestern University, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Princeton University, and Columbia University)\n\n\n\n\nPresidents of the University of Michigan\n| Number\n | Name\n | Portrait\n | Years in office\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Rev.

Allergic conjunctivitis involves mast cell-dependent inflammation in the mucosal surface (conjunctiva) of the eye. Macular degeneration results from photoreceptor death in the macula.\n![](image)Normal vision.\n![](image)The same view with age-related macular degeneration.\nOno has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.[9][10][11][12] He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression.[13] He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed[14] and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression.[15] His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos.[16] This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs.[17][18] This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport.[19][20] NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase.[21] These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.[22][23][24][25] They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.[24][26]\n\n\nUsing transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice.[27] Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer.[28][29]\n\n\nMore recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface.[30][31] The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation.[32] Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Administrative work[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the executive committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked with the late president J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments.\n\n\nOno was then recruited to University College London to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the University College London-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members.[35] While at UCL, he also took on administrative duties including as associate dean of students and as a member of the University College London Council (the university's governing board).[36]\n\n\nIn 2006, Ono moved to Emory University as senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs.[37] He had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan.\n\n\nIn June 2010, he was named senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost at the University of Cincinnati, with oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning.[38][39] During that time, he helped lead major initiatives, including Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan which was released on April 11, 2011.[40]\n\n\nIn 2012, Ono was named the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati,[36] and became the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. At the University of Cincinnati, Ono lead the implementation of the Academic Master Plan that invested $100 million into academics at the institution, including strengthening advising, the Honors Program and Study Abroad. During his tenure the university completed a $1 billion capital campaign 5 months ahead of schedule. Considerable investment in the campus and surrounding area occurred during his tenure, including renovations of 6 colleges and of Nippert Stadium and Fifth Third Arena. U Square at the Loop, a $78 million mixed use development was opened during his presidency.[41] The University of Cincinnati also invested heavily in faculty recruitment, bringing more than 300 new faculty to the university in cluster hires.\n\n\nInside Higher Education named Ono America's most notable university president in 2015.[42] Upworthy has profiled him as one of 9 high-profile CEOs in the world who exemplify servant leadership.[43]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2016, Ono was named the 15th president and vice chancellor of the University of British Columbia in Canada, effective August 15.[44] He was re-appointed for a second five-year term on August 11, 2020.[45]\n\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Ono was named the 15th president of the University of Michigan in the United States. He became the first Asian American to lead the university when his five-year term began.[2][46]\n\n\n\n### Public communications[edit]\n\n\nOno has written on research and innovation,[47] college rankings,[48] healthcare,[49] STEM education,[50] diversity,[50] social media,[51] and more.[51]\n\n\nOno has also reached out to the public by giving talks at K\u201312 schools in the US, the UK and Canada and to the general public at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, where he gave talks to K\u201312 students in the Student Education program and to adult audiences in the Talking Points Evening Lecture Series.[52] He has also served as an invited panelist to discuss the Reith Lectures at Windsor Castle on BBC Radio 4.\n\n\nHe has spoken and written frequently on the issue of mental health in adolescents and young adults and advocated for enhanced funding for identifying at-risk youth and for early mental health interventions.[53][54]\n\n\nDuring his term as president of the University of Michigan, Santa Ono showed strong support against terrorism. Santa Ono condemned the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas twice[55][56] and prevented tearing down posters of Israeli hostages hang around the campus.[57]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nOno received an honorary doctorate degree from Chiba University in Japan in 2016[58] and an honorary doctor of divinity from the Vancouver School of Theology of the University of British Columbia in 2020.[59]\n\n\nOno is the recipient of the Pharmacia International Award in Allergy Research (the top international prize awarded to inflammation researchers under the age of 40), a Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, the American Diabetes Association Career Development Award, the Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, a Lucille P.

Headquartered in Oakland, the system is composed of its ten campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz, along with numerous research centers and academic abroad centers.[5] The system is the state's land-grant university.[6] Major publications generally rank most UC campuses as being among the best universities in the world. In 1900, UC was one of the founders of the Association of American Universities and since the 1970s seven of its campuses, in addition to Berkeley, have been admitted to the association. Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, Irvine, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego are considered Public Ivies, making California the state with the most universities in the nation to hold the title.[7][8] UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline, with UC faculty and researchers having won 71 Nobel Prizes as of 2021.[9]\n\n\nThe system's ten campuses have a combined student body of 294,309 students, 24,800 faculty members, 167,300 staff members and over two million living alumni.[2] Its newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005. Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students; one campus, UC San Francisco, enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences. In addition, the University of California College of the Law located in San Francisco, is legally affiliated with UC and shares its name but is otherwise autonomous. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also includes the California State University system and the California Community Colleges system. UC is governed by a Board of Regents whose autonomy from the rest of the state government is protected by the state constitution.[10] The University of California also manages or co-manages three national laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).[11]\n\n\nThe University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in Oakland, where it absorbed the assets of the College of California before moving to Berkeley in 1873.[12][13] It also affiliated with independent medical and law schools in San Francisco. Over the next eight decades, several branch locations and satellite programs were established across the state. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus in Berkeley, with UC President Robert Gordon Sproul staying in place as chief executive of the UC system, while Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first chancellor[14][15][16][17] and Raymond B. Allen became the first chancellor of UCLA.[18] However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies,[19] and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as UC president that UC was able to evolve into a university system from 1957 to 1960.[20] At that time, chancellors were appointed for additional campuses and each was granted some degree of greater autonomy.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In November 1857, the College of California's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley.\nIn 1849, the state of California ratified its first constitution, which contained the express objective of creating a complete educational system including a state university.[22] Taking advantage of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts, the California State Legislature established an Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College in 1866.[23][24] However, it existed only on paper, as a placeholder to secure federal land-grant funds.[24]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Congregational minister Henry Durant, an alumnus of Yale, had established the private Contra Costa Academy, on June 20, 1853, in Oakland, California.[23] The initial site was bounded by Twelfth and Fourteenth Streets and Harrison and Franklin Streets in downtown Oakland[23] (and is marked today by State Historical Plaque No. 45 at the northeast corner of Thirteenth and Franklin). In turn, the academy's trustees were granted a charter in 1855 for a College of California, though the college continued to operate as a college preparatory school until it added college-level courses in 1860.[23][24] The college's trustees, educators, and supporters believed in the importance of a liberal arts education (especially the study of the Greek and Roman classics), but ran into a lack of interest in liberal arts colleges on the American frontier (as a true college, the college was graduating only three or four students per year).[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)South Hall, built in 1873, is the oldest building on the Berkeley campus.\nIn November 1857, the college's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley for a future planned campus to the north of Oakland.[23] But first, they needed to secure the college's water rights by buying a large farm to the east.[23] In 1864, they organized the College Homestead Association, which borrowed $35,000 to purchase the land, plus another $33,000 to purchase 160 acres (650,000 m2) of land to the south of the future campus.[25] The association subdivided the latter parcel and started selling lots with the hope it could raise enough money to repay its lenders and also create a new college town.[23] But sales of new homesteads fell short.[23]\n\n\nGovernor Frederick Low favored the establishment of a state university based upon the University of Michigan plan, and thus in one sense may be regarded as the founder of the University of California.[23][24] At the College of California's 1867 commencement exercises, where Low was present, Yale University professor Benjamin Silliman Jr. criticized the 1866 California law for establishing a polytechnic school, instead of a real university.[23][24] That same day, Low reportedly first suggested a merger of the already-functional College of California (which had land, buildings, faculty, and students, but not enough money) with the nonfunctional state college (which had money and nothing else), and went on to participate in the ensuing negotiations.[23][24]\n\n\n\n![](image)UC San Francisco campus in 1908.\nOn October 9, 1867, the college's trustees reluctantly agreed to join forces with the state college to their mutual advantage, but under one condition\u2014that there not be simply an \"Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College\", but a complete university, within which the assets of the College of California would be used to create a College of Letters (now known as the College of Letters and Science).[23][24][26] Accordingly, the Organic Act, establishing the University of California, was introduced as a bill by Assemblyman John W. Dwinelle on March 5, 1868, and after it was duly passed by both houses of the state legislature, it was signed into state law by Governor Henry H. Haight (Low's successor) on March 23, 1868.[23][24][27] However, as legally constituted, the new university was *not* an actual merger of the two colleges, but was an entirely new institution which merely inherited certain objectives and assets from each of them.[28] The University of California's second president, Daniel Coit Gilman, opened its new campus in Berkeley in September 1873.[29]\n\n\n\n### UC affiliates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Citrus Experiment Station, built in 1917, is the oldest building on the UC Riverside campus.\nSection 8 of the Organic Act authorized the Board of Regents to affiliate the University of California with independent self-sustaining professional colleges.[30][31] \"Affiliation\" meant UC and its affiliates would \"share the risk in launching new endeavors in education\".[30] The affiliates shared the prestige of the state university's brand, and UC agreed to award degrees in its own name to their graduates on the recommendation of their respective faculties, but the affiliates were otherwise managed independently by their own boards of trustees, charged their own tuition and fees, and maintained their own budgets separate from the UC budget.[30] It was through the process of affiliation that UC was able to claim it had medical and law schools in San Francisco within a decade of its founding.[30]\n\n\nIn 1879, California adopted its second and current constitution, which included unusually strong language to ensure UC's independence from the rest of the state government.[10][32] This had lasting consequences for the Hastings College of the Law, which had been separately chartered and affiliated in 1878 by an act of the state legislature at the behest of founder Serranus Clinton Hastings.[33] After a falling out with his own handpicked board of directors, the founder persuaded the state legislature in 1883 and 1885 to pass new laws to place his law school under the direct control of the Board of Regents.[34] In 1886, the Supreme Court of California declared those newer acts to be unconstitutional because the clause protecting UC's independence in the 1879 state constitution had stripped the state legislature of the ability to amend the 1878 act.[35][36] To this day, the Hastings College of the Law remains an affiliate of UC, maintains its own board of directors, and is not governed by the regents.[30][35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hart Hall, built in 1928, is the oldest building on the UC Davis campus.\nIn contrast, Toland Medical College (founded in 1864 and affiliated in 1873) and later, the dental, pharmacy, and nursing schools in San Francisco were affiliated with UC through written agreements, and not statutes invested with constitutional importance by court decisions.[30] In the early 20th century, the Affiliated Colleges (as they came to be called) began to agree to submit to the regents' governance during the term of President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, as the Board of Regents had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC brand but over which UC had no real control.[30] While Hastings remained independent, the Affiliated Colleges were able to increasingly coordinate their operations with one another under the supervision of the UC president and regents, and evolved into the health sciences campus known today as the University of California, San Francisco.[30]\n\n\n\n### North-south tensions and decentralization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Powell Library, built in 1929, is one of the four oldest buildings on the UCLA campus.\nIn August 1882, the California State Normal School (whose original normal school in San Jose is now San Jose State University) opened a second school in Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California.[37] In 1887, the Los Angeles school was granted its own board of trustees independent of the San Jose school, and in 1919, the state legislature transferred it to UC control and renamed it the Southern Branch of the University of California.[38] In 1927, it became the University of California at Los Angeles; the \"at\" would be replaced with a comma in 1958.[39]\n\n\nLos Angeles surpassed San Francisco in the 1920 census to become the most populous metropolis in California. Because Los Angeles had become the state government's single largest source of both tax revenue and votes, its residents felt entitled to demand more prestige and autonomy for their campus. Their efforts bore fruit in March 1951, when UCLA became the first UC site outside of Berkeley to achieve *de jure* coequal status with the Berkeley campus. That month, the regents approved a reorganization plan under which both the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses would be supervised by chancellors reporting to the UC president.[14][15][16][40] However, the 1951 plan was severely flawed; it was overly vague about how the chancellors were to become the \"executive heads\" of their campuses. Due to stubborn resistance from President Sproul and several vice presidents and deans\u2014who simply carried on as before\u2014the chancellors ended up as glorified provosts with limited control over academic affairs and long-range planning while the president and the regents retained *de facto* control over everything else.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)UC Irvine was founded and had its campus built out in the 1960s.\nUpon becoming president in October 1957, Clark Kerr supervised UC's rapid transformation into a true public university system through a series of proposals adopted unanimously by the regents from 1957 to 1960.[20][21] Kerr's reforms included expressly granting all campus chancellors the full range of executive powers, privileges, and responsibilities which Sproul had denied to Kerr himself, as well as the radical decentralization of a tightly knit bureaucracy in which all lines of authority had always run directly to the president at Berkeley or to the regents themselves.[20][21][40] In 1965, UCLA Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy tried to push this to what he saw as its logical conclusion: he advocated for authorizing all chancellors to report directly to the Board of Regents, thereby rendering the UC president redundant.[41] Murphy wanted to transform UC from one federated university into a confederation of independent universities, similar to the situation in Kansas (from where he was recruited).[41] Murphy was unable to develop any support for his proposal, Kerr quickly put down what he thought of as \"Murphy's rebellion\", and therefore Kerr's vision of UC as a university system prevailed: \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Geisel Library, at UC San Diego, was built in 1970.\nDuring the 20th century, UC acquired additional satellite locations which, like Los Angeles, were all subordinate to administrators at the Berkeley campus. California farmers lobbied for UC to perform applied research responsive to their immediate needs; in 1905, the Legislature established a \"University Farm School\" at Davis and in 1907 a \"Citrus Experiment Station\" at Riverside as adjuncts to the College of Agriculture at Berkeley. In 1912, UC acquired a private oceanography laboratory in San Diego, which had been founded nine years earlier by local business promoters working with a Berkeley professor. In 1944, UC acquired Santa Barbara State College from the California State Colleges, the descendants of the State Normal Schools.[42] In 1958, the regents began promoting these locations to general campuses, thereby creating UCSB (1958), UC Davis (1959), UC Riverside (1959), UC San Diego (1960), and UCSF (1964).[43][44] Each campus was also granted the right to have its own chancellor upon promotion. In response to California's continued population growth, UC opened two additional general campuses in 1965, with UC Irvine opening in Irvine and UC Santa Cruz opening in Santa Cruz.[43] The youngest campus, UC Merced opened in fall 2005 to serve the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n\n\n![](image)UC Santa Cruz, founded in 1965.\nAfter losing campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to the University of California system, supporters of the California State College system arranged for the state constitution to be amended in 1946 to prevent similar losses from happening again in the future.[42]\n\n\nWith decentralization complete, it was decided in 1986 that the UC president should no longer be based at the Berkeley campus, and the UC Office of the President moved to Kaiser Center in Oakland in 1989.[45] That lakefront location was subject to widespread criticism as \"too elegant and too corporate for a public university\".[46] In 1998, the Office of the President moved again, to a newly constructed but much more modest building near the former site of the College of California in Oakland.[47]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UC Merced, founded in 2005.\nThe California Master Plan for Higher Education of 1960 established that UC must admit undergraduates from the top 12.5% (one-eighth) of graduating high school seniors in California. Prior to the promulgation of the Master Plan, UC was to admit undergraduates from the top 15%. UC does not currently adhere to all tenets of the original Master Plan, such as the directives that no campus was to exceed total enrollment of 27,500 students (in order to ensure quality) and that public higher education should be tuition-free for California residents. Five campuses, Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego, each have current total enrollment at over 30,000, and of these five, all but Irvine have undergraduate enrollments over 30,000.[3]\n\n\nAfter the state electorate severely limited long-term property tax revenue by enacting Proposition 13 in 1978, UC was forced to make up for the resulting collapse in state financial support by imposing a variety of fees which were tuition in all but name.[48][49][50] On November 18, 2010, the regents finally gave up on the longstanding legal fiction that UC does not charge tuition by renaming the Educational Fee to \"Tuition\".[51] As part of its search for funds during the 2000s and 2010s, UC quietly began to admit higher percentages of highly accomplished (and more lucrative) students from other states and countries,[52] but was forced to reverse course in 2015 in response to the inevitable public outcry and start admitting more California residents.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2022, about 48,000 academic workers at all regent-governed UC campuses, as well as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, went on strike for higher pay and benefits as authorized by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.[55] UAW has cited more than 20 unfair labor practice charges performed by UC, including unilateral changes in policy and obstructing worker negotiation.[56] The strike lasted almost six weeks, officially ending on December 23.[57]\n\n\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Office of the President of the University of California, in Oakland\nAll University of California campuses except Hastings College of the Law are governed by the Regents of the University of California as required by the Constitution of the State of California.[32] Eighteen regents are appointed by the governor for 12-year terms.[32] One member is a student appointed for a one-year term.[32] There are also seven *ex officio* members\u2014the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the alumni associations of UC, and the UC president.[32] The Academic Senate, made up of faculty members, is empowered by the regents to set academic policies.[32] In addition, the system-wide faculty chair and vice-chair sit on the Board of Regents as non-voting members.[32]\n\n\n\n### President of the University of California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blake House and Gardens, built by architect Walter Danforth Bliss in 1924, served as the official residence of the UC President, from 1967 until 2008, when it was opened to the public.\nOriginally, the president was the chief executive of the first campus, Berkeley. In turn, other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were treated as off-site departments of the Berkeley campus, and were headed by provosts who were subordinate to the president. In March 1951, the regents reorganized the university's governing structure. Starting with the 1952\u201353 academic year, day-to-day \"chief executive officer\" functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred to chancellors who were vested with a high degree of autonomy, and reported as equals to UC's president.[14][15][16] As noted above, the regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964,[43] and the three campuses added since then have also been run by chancellors. In turn, all chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the University of California President. Today, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff to the Regents of the University of California share an office building in downtown Oakland that serves as the UC system's headquarters.[58]\n\n\nKerr's vision for UC governance was \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[59] In other words, the internal delegation of operational authority to chancellors at the campus level and allowing nine other campuses to become separate centers of academic life independent of Berkeley did not change the fact that all campuses remain part of one legal entity. As a 1968 UC centennial coffee table book explained: \"Yet for all its campuses, colleges, schools, institutes, and research stations, it remains one University, under one Board of Regents and one president\u2014the University of California.\"[60] UC continues to take a \"united approach\" as one university in matters in which it inures to UC's advantage to do so, such as when negotiating with the legislature and governor in Sacramento.[59] The University of California continues to manage certain matters at the systemwide level in order to maintain common standards across all campuses, such as student admissions, appointment and promotion of faculty, and approval of academic programs.[61]\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n![](image)Michael V.

Drake\n |\n\n\nAll UC presidents had been white men until 2013, when former Homeland Security Secretary, and Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano became the first woman to hold the office of UC President.[62] On July 7, 2020, Dr. Michael V. Drake, a former UC chancellor and medical research professor, was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first black president to hold the office in UC's 152-year history. He took office on August 1, 2020.[63]\n\n\n\nOfficial residences\n![](image)University House, Berkeley served as the official residence of the UC President from 1911 until 1958. Today it serves Berkeley's Chancellor.\nBesides substantial six-figure incomes, the UC president and all UC chancellors enjoy controversial perks such as free housing in the form of university-maintained mansions.[64] In 1962, Anson Blake's will donated his 10-acre (40,000\u00a0m2) estate (Blake Garden) and mansion (Blake House) in Kensington to the University of California's Department of Landscape Architecture. In 1968, the regents decided to make Blake House the official residence of the UC president. As of 2005, it cost around $300,000 per year to maintain Blake Garden and Blake House; the latter, built in 1926, is a 13,239-square-foot (1,229.9\u00a0m2) mansion with a view of San Francisco Bay.[64]\n\n\nBlake House has sat vacant since President Dynes departed in 2008, due to the high cost of needed seismic strengthening and renovating its dilapidated interior (estimated at $3.5 million in 2013).[65] From 2008 to 2022, all three UC presidents during that timeframe (i.e., Yudof, Napolitano, and Drake) lived in rented homes.[65] In 2022, UC finally purchased the Selden Williams House, a 6,400-square-foot (590\u00a0m2) house in Berkeley, for $6.5 million to serve as the UC president's official residence.[65] UC had previously owned the same home from 1971 to 1991, when it served as the official residence of the UC vice president.[65] (UC no longer has a single \"vice president\"; the president's direct reports now have titles like \"executive vice president\", \"senior vice president\", or \"vice president\".[66]) \n\n\n\n![](image)Selden Williams House, built in 1928 and designed by architect Julia Morgan, serves as the official residence of the UC President, since 2022.\nAll UC chancellors traditionally live for free in a mansion on or near campus that is usually known as *University House*, where they host social functions attended by guests and donors.[67] Berkeley's University House formerly served as the official residence of the UC president, but is now the official residence of Berkeley's chancellor. UCSD's University House was closed from 2004 to 2014 for $10.5 million in renovations paid for by private donors, which were so expensive because the 12,000-square-foot structure sits on top of a sacred Native American cemetery and next to an unstable coastal bluff.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California finances\n\nThe State of California currently (2021\u20132022) spends $3.467 billion on the UC system, out of total UC operating revenues of $41.6 billion. The \"UC Budget for Current Operations\" lists the medical centers as the largest revenue source, contributing 39% of the budget, the federal government 11%, Core Funds (State General Funds, UC General Funds, student tuition) 21%, private support (gifts, grants, endowments) 7% ,and Sales and Services at 21%. In 1980, the state funded 86.8% of the UC budget.[70] While state funding has somewhat recovered, as of 2019 state support still lags behind even recent historic levels (e.g. 2001) when adjusted for inflation.[70][71]\n\n\nAccording to the California Public Policy Institute, California spends 12% of its General Fund on higher education, but that percentage is divided between the University of California, California State University and California Community Colleges. Over the past forty years, state funding of higher education has dropped from 18% to 12%, resulting in a drop in UC's per student funding from $23,000 in 2016 to a current $8,000 per year per student.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of the UC Office of the President.\nIn May 2004, UC President Robert C. Dynes and CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed struck a private deal, called the \"Higher Education Compact\", with Governor Schwarzenegger. They agreed to slash spending by about a billion dollars (about a third of the university's core budget for academic operations) in exchange for a funding formula lasting until 2011. The agreement calls for modest annual increases in state funds (but not enough to replace the loss in state funds Dynes and Schwarzenegger agreed to), private fundraising to help pay for basic programs, and large student fee hikes, especially for graduate and professional students. A detailed analysis of the Compact by the Academic Senate \"Futures Report\" indicated, despite the large fee increases, the university core budget did not recover to 2000 levels.[73] Undergraduate student fees have risen 90% from 2003 to 2007.[74] In 2011, for the first time in UC's history, student fees exceeded contributions from the State of California.[75]\n\n\nThe First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled in 2007 that the University of California owed nearly $40 million in refunds to about 40,000 students who were promised that their tuition fees would remain steady, but were hit with increases when the state ran short of money in 2003.[76]\n\n\nIn September 2019, the University of California announced it will divest its $83 billion in endowment and pension funds from the fossil fuel industry, ostensibly to avoid the \"financial risk\" inherent in that industry because of climate change, but also responsive pleas to stop investing in fossil fuel.[77]\n\n\n\n### Criticism[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the regional accreditor of the UC schools, criticized the UC system for \"significant problems in governance, leadership and decision making\" and \"confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the university president, the regents and the 10 campus chancellors with no clear lines of authority and boundaries\".[78]\n\n\nIn 2016, university system officials admitted that they monitored all e-mails sent to and from their servers.[79]\n\n\n\n## Campuses and rankings[edit]\n\n\n![A topographic map of California with the UC campuses marked](image)![Berkeley](image)\nBerkeley\n ![San Diego](image)\nSan Diego\n ![Los Angeles](image)\nLos Angeles\n ![Santa Barbara](image)\nSanta Barbara\n ![San Francisco](image)\nSan Francisco\n ![Irvine](image)\nIrvine\n ![Davis](image)\nDavis\n ![Santa Cruz](image)\nSanta Cruz\n ![Riverside](image)\nRiverside\n ![Merced](image)\nMerced\nclass=notpageimage|\nThe ten UC campuses\n\nAt present, the UC system officially describes itself as a \"ten campus\" system consisting of the campuses listed below.[80] These campuses are under the direct control of the regents and president.[81] Only ten campuses are listed on the official UC letterhead.[82]\n\n\nAlthough it shares the name and public status of the UC system, the College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly Hastings College of the Law) is not controlled by the regents or president; it has a separate board of directors and must seek funding directly from the Legislature. However, under the California Education Code, Hastings degrees are awarded in the name of the regents and bear the signature of the UC president.[83] Furthermore, Education Code section 92201 states that Hastings \"is affiliated with the University of California, and is the law department thereof\".[84]\n\n\n\n### University rankings[edit]\n\n\nAnnually, UC campuses are ranked highly by various publications. Six UC campuses rank in the top 50 U.S. National Universities of 2022 by *U.S. News & World Report*, with UCLA, Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Davis all ranked in the top 50. Four UC campuses also ranked in the top 50 in the *U.S. News & World Report* Best Global Universities Rankings in 2021, namely Berkeley, UCLA, UCSF, and UC San Diego.[85] UCSF is ranked as one of the top universities in biomedicine in the world[86][87][88][89][90][91] and the UCSF School of Medicine is ranked 3rd in the United States among research-oriented medical schools and for primary care by *U.S. News & World Report*.[92]\n\n\nThree UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 15 universities in the US according to the 2020 *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* US National University Rankings and also in the top 20 in World University Rankings. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities* also ranked UCSF, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Barbara in the top 50 US National Universities and in the top 100 World Universities in 2020.[93]\n\n\nBerkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 50 universities in the world according to both the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* for 2021 and the *Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)* for 2020, while UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis ranked in the top 100 universities in the world.[94][95] *Forbes* also ranked the six UC campuses mentioned above as being in the top 50 universities in America in 2021.[96] Forbes also named the top three public universities in America as all being UC campuses, namely, Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD, and ranked three more campuses, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Irvine as being among the top 20 public universities in America in 2021.[97] The six aforementioned campuses are all considered Public Ivies.[7] The *QS World University Rankings* for 2021 ranked three UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego as being in the top 100 universities in the world.[98]\n\n\nIndividual academic departments also rank highly among the UC campuses. The 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* Best Graduate Schools report ranked Berkeley as being among the top 5 universities in the nation in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, and ranked UCLA in the top 20 in the same departments.[99][100] *U.S. News & World Report* also ranked the same departments at UC San Diego among the top 20 in the nation, with the exception of the departments of Sociology, History, and English.[101] UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara ranked in the top 50 in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, with the exception of UC Santa Barbara's Psychology and Political Science departments, according to *U.S. News & World Report*. UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside ranked in the top 100 in the nation in the same departments, along with UC Merced's Psychology and Political Science departments.[102][103][104]\n\n\n\n| Campus\n | Founded\n | Enrollment\n(2022)[105]\n | Endowment\n(2022)[106]\n | Athletics\n | Rankings\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Affiliation\n | Nickname\n | *ARWU National Ranking*[93] | *ARWU World Ranking*[93] | *CWUR*[94] | *Forbes*[96] | *THE World University Rankings*[95] | *QS World University Rankings*[98] | *U.S. News & World Report National Ranking*[107] | *U.S. News & World Report World Ranking*[85] |\n| ![](image)  **Berkeley** | 1868\n | 45,307\n | $6.91 billion\n | NCAA Div IPac-12 | Golden Bears | 4\n | 5\n | 12\n | 2\n | 8\n | 10\n | 15\n | 4\n |\n| ![](image) **Davis** | 1905\n | 39,679\n | $2.06 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Aggies | 40\u201354\n | 101\u2013150\n | 52\n | 23\n | 63\n | 132\n | 28\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image) **Irvine** | 1965\n | 35,937\n | $1.25 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Anteaters | 33\n | 61\n | 82\n | 30\n | 95\n | 268\n | 33\n | 86\n |\n| ![](image) **Los Angeles** | 1919\n | 46,430\n | $6.72 billion\n | NCAA Div IPac-12 (Big Ten in 2024) | Bruins | 11\n | 13\n | 18\n | 6\n | 21\n | 29\n | 15\n | 14\n |\n| ![](image) **Merced** | 2005\n | 9,103\n | $85 million\n | NAIACalPac | Golden Bobcats | 107\u2013127\n | 401\u2013500\n | 841\n | 309\n | 301\u2013350\n | \u2014\n | 60\n | 718\n |\n| ![](image) **Riverside** | 1954\n | 26,809\n | $354 million\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Highlanders | 63\u201385\n | 201\u2013300\n | 252\n | 84\n | 251\u2013300\n | 404\n | 76\n | 169\n |\n| ![](image) **San Diego** | 1960\n | 42,006\n | $2.39 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Tritons | 16\n | 21\n | 33\n | 17\n | 32\n | 62\n | 28\n | 21\n |\n| ![](image) **San Francisco** | 1864\n | 3,140(Graduate only) | $5.46 billion\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 15\n | 19\n | 36\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 11\n |\n| ![](image) **Santa Barbara** | 1909\n | 26,420\n | $544 million\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Gauchos | 32\n | 57\n | 98\n | 39\n | 64\n | 163\n | 35\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image) **Santa Cruz** | 1965\n | 19,478\n | $269 million\n | NCAA Div IIIC2C | Banana Slugs | 55\u201362\n | 151\u2013200\n | 306\n | 87\n | 192\n | 332\n | 82\n | 103\n |\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Doe Memorial Library, main facility of the UC Berkeley Libraries.\n![](image)Langson Library at UC Irvine.\nAs of 2021, UC controls over 13,308 active patents. UC researchers and faculty were responsible for 1,718 new inventions that same year.[2] On average, UC researchers create five new inventions per day.[2]\n\n\nEight of UC's ten campuses (Berkeley, UC Davis, UCI, UCLA, UC Riverside, UCSD, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz) are members of the Association of American Universities (AAU),[2] an alliance of elite American research universities[108] founded in 1900 at UC's suggestion.[109] Collectively, the system counts among its faculty (as of 2002):\n\n\n\n* 389 members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences\n* 5 Fields Medal recipients\n* 19 Fulbright Scholars\n* 25 MacArthur Fellows\n* 254 members of the National Academy of Sciences\n* 91 members of the National Academy of Engineering\n* 13 National Medal of Science laureates\n* 61 Nobel laureates[9]\n* 106 members of the Institute of Medicine\n\n\n### Nobel Prize winners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Powell Library, main facility of the UCLA Library.\n![](image)Kolligian Library at UC Merced.\nAs of October 2021, the following data are taken from List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation, which counts university alumni and staff, and are not the official count from the University of California. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Campus\n | Nr. of winners\n | Founded\n | Nr. of Winners/\n10 years of age\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Berkeley | 110\n | 1868\n | 7.2\n |\n| San Diego | 28\n | 1960\n | 4.6\n |\n| Los Angeles | 27\n | 1919\n | 2.6\n |\n| Santa Barbara | 14\n | 1909\n | 1.8\n |\n| San Francisco | 10\n | 1864\n | 0.7\n |\n| Irvine | 7\n | 1965\n | 1.3\n |\n| Davis | 4\n | 1905\n | 0.3\n |\n| Riverside | 3\n | 1954\n | 0.4\n |\n| Santa Cruz | 1\n | 1965\n | 0.2\n |\n| Merced | 0\n | 2005\n | 0\n |\n\n\n### UC Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California Libraries\n\n![](image)Davidson Library, the main facility of the UC Santa Barbara Library.\nAt 40.8 million print volumes,[110] the University of California library system is home to one of the largest collections of printed materials in the world. On July 27, 2021, all ten campuses went live with a unified online library catalog, UC Library Search. Besides on-campus libraries, the UC system also maintains two regional library facilities (one each for Northern and Southern California), which each accept older items from all UC campus libraries in their respective region. As of 2019, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 7.4 million items, while Southern Regional Library Facility is home to 6.5 million items.\n\n\n\n### Academic calendar[edit]\n\n\nEight campuses operate on the quarter system, while two (Berkeley and Merced) are on the semester system. However, all five law schools operate on the semester system, as does the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\n\n\n\n### Academic organization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McHenry Library at UC Santa Cruz.\nDavis, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara all followed Berkeley's example by aggregating the majority of arts, humanities, and science departments into a relatively large College of Letters and Science. Therefore, at Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara, their respective College of Letters and Science is by far the single largest academic unit on each campus. The College of Letters and Science at Los Angeles is the largest academic unit in the entire UC system.[111] Riverside later separated the natural sciences and kept only social sciences grouped with arts and humanities, an example followed by Merced at its founding.\n\n\nDue to President Kerr's interest in not reproducing the impersonal undergraduate experience often seen in such gigantic academic units, San Diego and Santa Cruz both implemented residential college systems inspired by British models (in which each college has distinctive general education requirements reflecting its chosen theme)[112] and grouped most academic departments into a small number of broadly defined divisions which are all independent of the colleges.\n\n\nFinally, Irvine is organized into 13 schools and San Francisco is organized into four schools, all of which are relatively narrow in scope.\n\n\n\n## Admissions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kerckhoff Hall is home of the Associated Students of the University of California, Los Angeles.\nEach UC campus handles admissions separately, but a student wishing to apply for an undergraduate or transfer admission uses one application for all UC campuses. Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly and separately by each department or program to which one applies.\n\n\nIn May 2020, UC approved plans to suspend standardized testing score requirements in admissions until 2024.[113] In May 2021, after a student lawsuit, the University of California announced that it would no longer consider SAT and ACT scores in admissions and scholarship decisions.[114]\n\n\nThe Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) was established in 1976 by University of California (UC) in response to the State Legislature's recommendation to expand post-secondary opportunities to all of California's students including those who are first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.[115] As UC's largest academic preparation program, EAOP assists middle and high school students with academic preparation, admissions requirements, and financial aid requirements for higher education.[116] The program designs and provides services to foster students' academic development, and delivers those services in partnership with other academic preparation programs, schools, other higher education institutions and community/industry partners.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haas School of Business at Berkeley is ranked among the best business schools in the world.\nThe University of California admits a significant number of transfer students primarily from the California Community Colleges.[118] Approximately one out of three UC students begin at a community college before graduating.[118] In evaluating a transfer student's application the universities conduct a \"comprehensive review\" process that includes consideration of grade point averages of the generally required, transferable and or related courses for the intended major. The review may also include consideration of an applicant's enrollment in selective honor courses or programs, extracurricular activities, essay, family history, life challenges, and the location of the student's residence. Different universities emphasize different factors in their evaluations.[119]\n\n\n\n### Freshmen[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus but otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were *redirected* to another campus with available space.[120][121] Students who did not want to be redirected were refunded their application fees.[*citation needed*] UC Riverside chancellor Ivan Hinderaker explained in 1972: \"Redirection has been a negative rather than a plus. Some come with a chip on their shoulders so big they never give the campus a chance. They poison the attitudes of the students around them.\"[121]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacobs School of Engineering, at San Diego, is one of the top-ranked engineering schools in the country.\nTherefore, in 1986, the undergraduate application system was changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.[120]\n\n\nThe University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below). Part of the eligibility process is completion of the A-G requirements in high school. All eligible California high school students who apply are accepted to the university, though not necessarily to the campus of choice.[122][123] Eligible students who are not accepted to the campus(es) of their choice are placed in the \"referral pool\", where campuses with open space may offer admission to those students; in 2003, 10% of students who received an offer through this referral process accepted it.[124] In 2007, about 4,100 UC-eligible students who were not offered admission to their campus of choice were referred to UC Riverside or the system's newest campus, UC Merced.[125] In 2015, all UC-eligible students rejected by their campus of choice were redirected to UC Merced, which is now the only campus that has space for all qualified applicants.[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)UCLA School of Law is one of the top ranked law schools in the United States.\nThe old undergraduate admissions were conducted on a two-phase basis. In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a \"comprehensive review\" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder. Students who did not qualify for regular admission were \"admitted by exception\"; in 2002, approximately 2% of newly admitted undergraduates were admitted by exception.[127]\n\n\nThe process for determining admissions varies. At some campuses, such as Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, a point system is used to weight grade point average, SAT Reasoning or ACT scores, and SAT Subject scores, while at San Diego, Berkeley, and Los Angeles, academic achievement is examined in the context of the school and the surrounding community, known as a holistic review.\n\n\nRace, gender, national origin, and ethnicity were not used as UC admission criteria due to the passing of Proposition 209. This information was collected for statistical purposes.\n\n\nEligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0. Fully eligible ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of UC's undergraduate campuses, though not necessarily at their first-choice campus or even to a campus to which they applied.[122]\n\n\nIn 2021, the University of California freshmen class was its most diverse and largest ever, with 84,223 students.[128] Latinos were the largest group at 37%; Asian Americans at 34%; white non-Hispanics at 20%; African-Americans at 5%; and 4% composed of American Indians, Pacific Islanders or those who declined to state their race or ethnicity.[128]\n\n\n\n### Student profile[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of students and comparisons statewide-nationwide\n|  | Campuses\n(2022)[129]\n | California\n(2022)[130]\n | United States\n(2022)[131]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **African American** | 5% | 7% | 14%\n |\n| **American Indian** | 1% | 2% | 1%\n |\n| **Asian** | 32% | 16% | 6%\n |\n| **Hispanic/Latino(a)** (of any race; including Chicanos and White Hispanics)\n | 23% | 40% | 19%\n |\n| **Non-Hispanic White** | 22% | 35% | 59%\n |\n| **Pacific Islander** | (<1%)\n | 1%\n | (<1%)\n |\n| **International student** | 15% | N/A | N/A\n |\n| **Unknown** | 3% | N/A | N/A\n |\n\n\n### Admissions practices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mrak Hall serves as the administrative seat of UC Davis.\nIn many recent years, the University of California has faced growing criticism for high admissions of out-of-state or international students as opposed to in-state, California students. In particular, UC Berkeley and UCLA have been heavily criticized for this phenomenon due to their extraordinarily low acceptance rates compared to other campuses in the system.[132] At a Board of Regents meeting in 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown reportedly said about the problem: \"And so you got your foreign students and you got your 4.0 folks, but just the kind of ordinary, normal students, you know, that got good grades but weren't at the top of the heap there\u2014they're getting frozen out.\"[133] State lawmakers have proposed legislation that would reduce out-of-state admission.[134]\n\n\nA 2020 California auditor's report indicated that at least 64 wealthy students were wrongfully admitted to UC schools as favors to powerful figures.[135][136][137] Many of the admissions were justified by falsely classifying the applicants as student athletes. The incidents disproportionately (55 of 64) occurred at UC Berkeley.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, jointly run by UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Riverside.\nIn 2006 the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) awarded the University of California the SPARC Innovator Award for its \"extraordinarily effective institution-wide vision and efforts to move scholarly communication forward\", including the 1997 founding (under then UC President Richard C. Atkinson) of the California Digital Library (CDL) and its 2002 launching of CDL's eScholarship, an institutional repository. The award also specifically cited the widely influential 2005 academic journal publishing reform efforts of UC faculty and librarians in \"altering the marketplace\" by publicly negotiating contracts with publishers, as well as their 2006 proposal to amend UC's copyright policy to allow open access to UC faculty research.[138]\n\n\nOn July 24, 2013, the UC Academic Senate adopted an Open Access Policy, mandating that all UC faculty produced research with a publication agreement signed after that date be first deposited in UC's eScholarship open access repository.[139]\n\n\nUniversity of California systemwide research on the SAT exam found that, after controlling for familial income and parental education, so-called achievement tests known as the SAT II had 10 times more predictive ability of college aptitude than the SAT I.[140]\n\n\n\n## Peripheral enterprises[edit]\n\n\nThe University of California has a long tradition of involvement in many enterprises that are often geographically or organizationally separate from its general campuses, including national laboratories, observatories, hospitals, continuing education programs, hotels, conference centers, an airport, a seaport, and an art institute.\n\n\n\n### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the Berkeley Hills.\nThe University of California directly manages and operates one United States Department of Energy National Laboratory:[141]\n\n\n\n* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL, or Berkeley Lab) (Berkeley, California)\n\n\nUC is a limited partner in two separate private limited liability companies that manage and operate two other Department of Energy national laboratories:\n\n\n\n* Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Los Alamos, New Mexico) operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC.\n* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (Livermore, California) operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory staff on the magnet yoke for the 60-inch cyclotron, 1938; Nobel prize winners Ernest Lawrence, Edwin McMillan, and Luis Alvarez are shown, in addition to J. Robert Oppenheimer and Robert R. Wilson.\nThe **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** conducts unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines with key efforts focused on fundamental studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, new energy systems and environmental solutions, and the use of integrated computing as a tool for discovery.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Livermore Valley.\nThe **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory** uses advanced science and technology to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain reliable. LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\n\nThe **Los Alamos National Laboratory** focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attacks.\n\n\nThe UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of nuclear weapons. During the World War II Manhattan Project, Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for the separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into stockpile stewardship after the end of the Cold War. Historically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after Ernest O. Lawrence, have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, LLNL was not officially severed administratively from LBNL until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lick Observatory, atop Mount Hamilton in the Diablo Range.\nThe UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with Bechtel Corporation, BWXT, and the Washington Group International, and together they created a private company called Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a Lockheed Martin Corporation-created company that included, among others, the University of Texas System. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.[142] On October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System. Other than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\n\n\n\n### Observatories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Keck Observatory, atop Mauna Kea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii.\nThe University of California manages two observatories as a multi-campus research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz.\n\n\n\n* Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, in the Diablo Range just east of San Jose.\n* Keck Observatory at the 4,145 meters (13,599 feet) summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\n\nThe Astronomy Department at the Berkeley campus manages the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Shasta County.\n\n\n\n### High-performance networking[edit]\n\n\nThe University of California is a founding and charter member of the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California, a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.\n\n\n\n### UC Natural Reserve System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California Natural Reserve System\n\nThe NRS was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than 756,000 acres (3,060\u00a0km2).\n\n\n\n* Selected reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System\n* ![Coal Oil Point Reserve](image)\n\nCoal Oil Point Reserve\n* ![Rancho Marino Reserve](image)\n\nRancho Marino Reserve\n* ![Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve](image)\n\nStebbins Cold Canyon Reserve\n* ![Younger Lagoon Reserve](image)\n\nYounger Lagoon Reserve\n* ![Bodega Marine Reserve](image)\n\nBodega Marine Reserve\n\n\n### UC Agriculture and Natural Resources[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of California Agriculture and Natural Resources[143] (UCANR, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) plays an important role in the state's agriculture industry, as mandated by UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and Youth development research, every county in the state has a cooperative extension office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support 4-H programs and have nutrition, family, and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program[144] is a national leader in studying thriving in the field of youth development.[145]\n\n\n\n### Other national research centers[edit]\n\n\nFrom September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Federal Airfield \u2014the largest grant ever awarded the university. UC Santa Cruz managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of NASA's missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.\n\n\nSince 2002, the NSF-funded San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego has been managed by the University of California, which took over from the previous manager, General Atomics.\n\n\n\n### Medical centers and schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.\nThe University of California operates five medical centers throughout the state:\n\n\n\n* UC Davis Medical Center, in Sacramento;\n* UC Irvine Medical Center, in Orange;\n* UCLA Medical Center, comprising two distinct hospitals:\n\t+ Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, in Los Angeles;\n\t+ UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, in Santa Monica;\n* UC San Diego Medical Center, comprising two distinct hospitals:\n\t+ UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest, in San Diego;\n\t+ Jacobs Medical Center, in La Jolla; and\n* UCSF Medical Center, operating as a single medical center across three physically distinct campuses around San Francisco.\n\n\n* Medical centers of the University of California\n* ![UCD Medical Center](image)\n\nUCD Medical Center\n* ![UCSD Medical Center](image)\n\nUCSD Medical Center\n* ![UCLA Medical Center](image)\n\nUCLA Medical Center\n* ![UCSF Medical Center](image)\n\nUCSF Medical Center\n* ![UCI Medical Center](image)\n\nUCI Medical Center\n\n\nThere are two medical centers that bear the UCLA name, but are not operated by UCLA: Harbor\u2013UCLA Medical Center and Olive View\u2013UCLA Medical Center. They are actually Los Angeles County-operated facilities that UCLA uses as teaching hospitals.\n\n\n\n![](image)UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital.\nEach medical center serves as the primary teaching site for that campus's medical school. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by *U.S. News & World Report*.[146] The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded \u2013 the UCSF Medical Center was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by *U.S. News & World Report*'s 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.[147] UC also has a sixth medical school\u2014UC Riverside School of Medicine, the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984) each began as the respective county hospitals of Orange County, Sacramento County, and San Diego County. As of 2021, UC medical centers handle each year about 8.1 million outpatient visits, 349,074 emergency room visits, and roughly 1.1 million inpatient days.[2]\n\n\n\n### Facilities outside of California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Casa de California in Mexico City.\nUC operates several other miscellaneous sites to support faculty, students, and researchers away from its general campuses:\n\n\n\n* The UC Office of the President's Education Abroad Program currently operates one mini-campus which supports UC students, faculty, and alumni overseas:\n\t+ Casa de California in Mexico City.\n\t+ EAP also briefly operated California House in London during the early-to-mid 2000s.\n* UC Washington Center in Washington, D.C., with a dormitory for students interning with the federal government.\n\t+ UC Davis's UC Center Sacramento supports students interning with the California government.\n* UC Berkeley operates the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station in Mo'orea, French Polynesia on land donated in 1981 by the heir to the founder of the Gump's home furnishings store.[148]\n\n\n### Hospitality facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier, in La Jolla.\nUnlike other land-grant institutions (e.g., Cornell) UC does not provide a hospitality management program, but it does provide general hospitality at some locations: \n\n\n\n* UC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its \"Cal Discoveries Travel\" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in Pinecrest, California, the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.\n* Berkeley Lab operates its own hotel, the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.\n* UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services operates two on-campus hotels, the 61-room Guest House and the 254-room Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, and a lavish off-campus conference center at Lake Arrowhead (with a mix of chalet-like condominiums, lodge rooms, and stand-alone cottages). During the summer, the Lake Arrowhead conference center hosts the Bruin Woods vacation programs for UCLA alumni and their families.\n* Separately, UCLA Health operates the 100-room Tiverton House just south of the UCLA campus to serve its patients and their families.\n* UC Santa Cruz leased the University Inn and Conference Center in downtown Santa Cruz from 2001 to 2011 for use as off-campus student housing.\n\n\n### University Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley.\nUC Davis operates the University Airport as a utility airport for air shuttle service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples. It is also a public general aviation airport. University Airport's ICAO identifier is KEDU.\n\n\n\n### Seaport[edit]\n\n\nUC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography owns a seaport, the Nimitz Marine Facility, which is just south of Shelter Island on Point Loma, San Diego. The port is used as an operating base for all of its oceanographic vessels and platforms.\n\n\n\n### UC Extension[edit]\n\n\nFor over a century, the university has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of Continuing Legal Education and Continuing Medical Education in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates Continuing Education of the Bar under a joint venture agreement with the State Bar of California.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n\n\n* Police departments at the University of California\n* University of California Press\n* University of California Student Association\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As of June 30, 2022; includes assets managed by UC Regents on behalf of all UC campuses. \"Annual Endowment Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\" (PDF).

The Board of Regents has 26 voting members, the majority of whom are appointed by the Governor of California to serve 12-year terms.\n\n\nThe regents establish university policy; make decisions that determine student cost of attendance, admissions, employee compensation, and land management; and perform long-range planning for all UC campuses and locations.[4] The regents also control the investment of UC's endowment, and they supervise the making of contracts between UC and private companies.[5]\n\n\nThe structure and composition of the Board of Regents is laid out in the California Constitution, which establishes that the University of California is a \"public trust\" and that the regents are a \"corporation\" that has been granted the power to manage the trust on the public's behalf. The constitution grants the regents broad institutional autonomy,[6][7] giving them \"full powers of organization and government.\"[8] According to article IX, section 9, subsection (a), \"the regents are \"subject only to such legislative control as may be necessary to insure the security of its funds and compliance with the terms of the endowments of the university\".[8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSection 11 of the Organic Act establishing the University of California begins with the following sentence: \"The general government and superintendence of the University shall vest in a Board of Regents, to be denominated the 'Regents of the University of California,' who shall become incorporated under the general laws of the State of California by that corporate name and style.\"[9]\n\n\nThe Organic Act described three groups of regents: six ex officio regents, eight appointed regents, and eight \"honorary\" regents.[10] To expedite the formation of the university, the Organic Act authorized the governor to unilaterally select the eight appointed regents after the end of the current legislative session and allowed them to assume office immediately without the consent of the state senate.[10] Governor Henry Huntly Haight announced his selections in May 1868.[10] On May 23, a notice was published in the *San Francisco Examiner* of a meeting of the regents scheduled for May 28, but no record was made of this meeting.[10] On June 9, 1868, the first two groups of regents gathered together in San Francisco for the first recorded meeting of the Board of Regents, where the appointed regents drew lots to determine the lengths of their initial terms, and then the board proceeded to elect the eight honorary regents.[10] The \"honorary\" regents enjoyed the same authority and privileges as the first two groups of regents; the term \"honorary\" referred only to their method of selection.[10]\n\n\nAs required by Section 11, the Board of Regents proceeded to form a corporation denominated the Regents of the University of California on June 12, 1868, and filed the certificate of incorporation on June 18, 1868 with the California Secretary of State.[11] The corporation's official name today is still the Regents of the University of California.[12] Today, it is unusual for universities (or any other kind of corporation) to incorporate in the names of their boards, but it used to be a common practice among American universities. For example, Harvard University is still legally incorporated as the President and Fellows of Harvard College.[13]\n\n\nIncorporating the university under the exact same name as its board was just as confusing in the 19th century as it is today. In an 1894 wrongful death case, the plaintiffs did not understand this; they sued 16 regents individually, which forced the Supreme Court of California to analyze Section 11 and the June 18, 1868 certificate to hold that the original members of the Board of Regents had properly formed a corporation as a legal entity distinct from themselves. Therefore, the current members of that board could not be held liable in their individual capacities for the torts of the corporation.[14]\n\n\nThe current Board of Regents is a \"policy board,\" as a result of reforms unanimously adopted from 1957 to 1960 at the instigation of UC President Clark Kerr. Before Kerr's reforms, the regents operated as an \"administrative board\" (in Kerr's words) for almost a century. The board met 12 times per year and its finance committee (with full authority to act on behalf of the board) met an additional 11 times, and the university budget was excruciatingly detailed. The result was that the board collectively supervised every aspect of university affairs\u2014no matter how trivial or minor. One sign of the regents' unusually extreme level of micromanagement during this period was that it was seen as a major milestone when acting UC President Martin Kellogg gained the power in 1891 to independently hire janitors (as long as he reported on what he had done at the next meeting of the regents).[15] Another example is that until 1901, replacements for lost diplomas required the approval of the regents.[16] At Kerr's encouragement, the Board of Regents cut down on the number of meetings, delegated powers and responsibilities to the university president and the campus chancellors, delegated more power to the Academic Senate, simplified the UC budget, and greatly reduced the amount of detail that flowed upwards to the regents.[15]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is selected by the Board to represent the students for a one-year term through a hiring process that is conducted by the board.[17] The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, President and Vice President of the Alumni Associations of UC, and President of the University of California.[18]\n\n\nThe Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives and two non-voting Staff Advisors. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[19] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[20][21]\n\n\nAdministrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Regents of the University of California,[22] which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[23]\n\n\n\n## Significant corruption scandals[edit]\n\n\nThe Board of Regents has been the subject of various corruption scandals throughout the university's long history.\n\n\nThe board's first scandal surfaced in 1874.[24] By June 1872, regent Samuel Merritt had become the chair of the board's building committee and initiated planning for the original College of Letters building (later known as North Hall). Although the board also passed a resolution that same month prohibiting self-dealing with respect to construction of campus buildings, the winning bid was ultimately submitted by Merritt's preferred contractor, Power and Ough, \"and much of the lumber and cement for the building came from Merritt's own lumber company.\"[25] The *San Francisco Evening Post* broke the story on January 6, 1874, and two days later, the California State Assembly's public building committee launched an investigation which held hearings through March 3 of that year.[26] The committee concluded that Merritt had profited financially from providing an inferior building to the university at an exorbitant cost: $24,000 over its reasonable value.[26] Merritt resigned from the board in June 1874 and in October refunded $867 of his lumber company's profits to the university.[26]\n\n\nIn 1965, free-speech movement activist Marvin Garson responded to a call by the California Federation of Teachers to \"investigate the composition and operation of the Board of Regents.\" He produced a 19-page report documenting prior cases of corruption, concluding that, \"taken as a group, the Regents are representatives of only one thing\u2014corporate wealth.\"[27]\n\n\nIn 1970, the California state auditor found that regent Edwin W. Pauley, who owned Pauley Petroleum, personally profited when university officials steered $10.7\u00a0million dollars into one of his company's business deals.[28][29]\n\n\nIn 1970, the California state auditor investigated regent William French Smith and regent Edward Carter for conflict of interest dealings. The actions investigated included the joint purchase of a $253,750 piece of property for Carter's personal use, with the university paying $178,750 and Carter paying the remaining $75,000.[30] Smith, who was Governor Reagan's personal lawyer and a Reagan appointee to the board, was a lawyer at the law firm representing the Irvine Company, a private real estate company. Carter was a lifetime board member of the Irvine Foundation, which has a controlling interest in the Irvine Company.\n\n\nIn 2007, the Board of Regents signed the EBI contract, a $50\u00a0million university privatization contract funded by the BP oil company.[31] The contract gave financial control over all clean energy research at UC Berkeley to BP, with $15\u00a0million directed towards proprietary research allowing the oil company able to keep around a third of the patents produced by the academic employees while also financially controlling all other clean energy research upon the campus. The contract likewise allowed BP oil to construct a building on the UC Berkeley campus with entire floors that only BP employees are allowed to enter.[31] Before the signing of the contract, a number of environmental organizations, including Greenpeace penned a letter to the regents, which was read during the regents meeting on November 2, 2007, which stated \"The prospect of giant carbon polluters directing research related to and gaining control of key energy technologies is very troubling \u2013 especially when the research is conducted at, and the technologies are developed in collaboration with, public institutions.\"[32] Following the signing of the contract by the UC Regents, professors complained that BP Oil bypassed normal university hiring and tenure protocol and hired professors directly, without consulting any academic department.[33] Opponents have also argued this and other privatization contracts are a way to replace middle class engineering jobs with cheap graduate student labor.[34]\n\n\nRegent Richard C. Blum, financier and husband to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, served on the board of regents' Investment Committee. Allegations of conflicts of interest have arisen because, during Blum's tenure, UC has invested hundreds of millions of dollars where he had concurrent business interests.[35]\n\n\nAccording to an investigation by the Sacramento News & Review, conflict-of-interest dealings by the UC Board of Regents accelerated in the years prior to the 2008 recession. Beginning in 2003, \"[M]embers of the board of regents benefited from the placement of hundreds of millions of university dollars into investments, private deals and publicly held enterprises with significant ties to their own personal business activities, while simultaneously increasing the cost of university attendance.\"[35] Additionally, the investigation found that some members of the regents\u2019 investment committee, individuals who are also \"Wall Street heavy hitters,\" modified long-standing UC investment policies, specifically, steering away from investing in more traditional instruments (such as blue-chip stocks and bonds) toward largely unregulated and risky \"alternative\" investments, such as private equity and private real-estate deals.[35] These changes in UC investment policy brought personal gain to individual members of the board of regents Investment committee, while also reducing the funds within the UC endowment that might have otherwise been used to cover costs related to the operations of the university.\n\n\nIn May 2017, *The San Francisco Chronicle* reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[36] Only after extensive public outcry, university leadership released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[37]\n\n\n\n## Regents[edit]\n\n\n### Appointed regents[edit]\n\n\nThe eighteen appointed regents are appointed by the Governor of California to serve 12-year terms.\n\n\n\n\n\nAppointed Regents[38]\n| Name | Occupation | Year Appointed | Appointed by | Reappointed | Term expires | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sherry L.

Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[49]\n\n\n\n* Frederick Low (1868), 9th Governor of California from 1863 to 1867; considered the \"father of the University of California\"[50]\n* Andrew J.

From 2014 to June 2020, he was the 15th president of Ohio State University. From 2005 to 2014, he was the chancellor of the University of California, Irvine and prior to that served as vice president for health affairs for the University of California system.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMichael V. Drake was born in New York City and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California.[2] He is the son of a doctor and a social worker. His mother graduated from East High School in Youngstown, Ohio, before attending college in Baltimore. The family lived in Baltimore, Nashville, Tennessee, New York, and New Jersey before settling in Northern California. He graduated from C.K. McClatchy High School at Sacramento, California in 1967.[3] During college summers in the early 1970s, he worked at the original Tower Records.[4]\n\n\nDrake attended Sacramento City College from 1967 to 1969. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University in 1974 and a Doctor of Medicine and residency training from the University of California, San Francisco in 1975. He completed an Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2005.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDrake spent more than two decades on the faculty of the UCSF School of Medicine, ultimately becoming the Steven P. Shearing Professor of Ophthalmology and senior associate dean. He then served for five years as vice president for health affairs for the University of California system. From July 2005 to June 2014, Drake served as chancellor of the University of California, Irvine. He also served as a professor of ophthalmology (School of Medicine) and Education (School of Education).[7]\n\n\n\n### University of California, Irvine chancellorship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Drake was appointed as the fifth chancellor of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). He officially began his term on July 1, 2005.[8][9] His annual $350,000 salary remained unchanged from his previous position at the Office of the President.[*dead link*] As of 2010 he earned $374,969.32.[10]\n\n\n\n### Ohio State University presidency[edit]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2014, the Ohio State University Board of Trustees named Drake as the 15th president of Ohio State University. He began his tenure at the university on June 30, 2014.[11] At the time of his appointment, he was part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the board of directors of NCAA Division I.[12] In March 2015, Drake was appointed to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame board.[13]\n\n\nIn November 2019, the university announced that Drake would retire in 2020.[14]\n\n\n\n### University of California presidency[edit]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2020, Drake was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first Black president in UC's 152-year history.[15]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDrake is married to Brenda Drake. An alumna of Stanford and Berkeley Law, Brenda Drake is an attorney and has served as a director or trustee of organizations focused on education, international health, finance, civil rights and the arts, including the National Urban League, City Arts & Lectures in San Francisco, San Francisco University High School and Golden Gate Bank.[16] She is a director emerita and former board chair of Engender Health Inc., an international women's health organization, and is currently a trustee of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.[17][18] Drake and his wife have two adult sons and four grandchildren.\n\n\nDrake's first job was working at Tower Records. He is quoted as saying he has a \"passion for music, which is still a hobby today\".[19] In 2015, Drake was appointed to the board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. He has had a lifelong interest in music (notably rock and jazz), plays guitar, and teaches an undergraduate course on the music of the civil rights movement.[20]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Drake led the establishment of the Ohio State Tuition Guarantee, which freezes tuition, mandatory fees, housing and dining for four years for incoming, in-state freshmen. He also increased the value of Ohio State Land Grant Opportunity Scholarships to cover the full cost of attendance while doubling the size of the program in 2018.[21]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* In 2017, he and his wife, Brenda, were awarded the 10th Annual King Arts Legends & Legacies Award as well as the University of California-Irvine Medal, joining past honorees ranging from U.S. presidents to Ella Fitzgerald.[20]\n* Member of the Columbus Partnership[22]\n* Michael J. Hogan Award (laboratory science)[23]\n\n\n## Professional decisions[edit]\n\n\n### Chemerinsky firing and rehiring[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University of California, Irvine School of Law \u00a7\u00a0Chemerinsky hiring controversy\n\nDrake's first major firing scandal was to fire the Dean of the UCI law school, Erwin Chemerinsky. After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.[24]\n\n\nThe action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.[24][25] The issue was the subject of an editorial in *The New York Times* on September 14, 2007.[26] Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's then-Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local Republicans who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement.[27] On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.[28] On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.[29] In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.[30]\n\n\n\n### Waters firing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Ohio State University Marching Band \u00a7\u00a02014 hazing scandal\n\nDrake fired Ohio State marching band director Jon Waters on July 24, 2014,[31] after a university investigation found that the band's \"sexualized culture\" was \"inconsistent with the University's values and Title IX requirements\". The university stated that there were \"serious cultural issues and an environment conducive to sexual harassment within the Marching Band\", and that the band director \"was aware or reasonably should have known about\" it.[32] Waters sued for reinstatement, accusing the university, Drake, and a provost of discriminating against him by disciplining him differently than a female employee and denying him due process.[33][34][35][36] Drake has stood by his decision to terminate Waters as marching band director.[37] As of January 2015, the university had spent nearly $1 million in defense of the decision and subsequent actions.[38]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Date information sourced from Library of Congress Authorities data, via corresponding WorldCat Identities\u00a0linked authority file (LAF).\n2. **^** \"Michael V.

By the turn of the century, the school had grown larger and more complex, and the Visitors saw the need to appoint a president. When Woodrow Wilson, a University of Virginia law graduate yet to be president, declined the offer, they turned to Edwin Anderson Alderman, well known as an innovative educator in the South and a great orator across the nation. Alderman was inaugurated on Founder's Day, April 13, 1905. Within a year, Alderman had seen to the opening of a school of education at the University.\n2. **^** P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Richard (2012-06-26). \"Ousted Head of University Is Reinstated in Virginia\". *The New York Times*.

From 1991 to 1999, he was the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. From 1979 to 1987, he was a member of both houses of the Texas State Legislature. From 1987 to 1991, he was one of the three members of the Texas Railroad Commission. In 1998 and 2002, he was the Democratic Party's nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.\n\n\nSharp is also a principal in the Austin office of the Dallas-based Ryan & Company, a tax consulting firm. In 2005, he was appointed as chairman of the Texas Tax Reform Commission.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe son of an oil field worker and a school teacher, Sharp grew up in the small farming community of Placedo in Victoria County[1] along the Texas Gulf Coast. In 1972, Sharp earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Texas A&M University in College Station, where he was a member of Squadron 6 in the Corps of Cadets and was elected Student Body President.[2] Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserves. He belongs to American Legion Post 76 in Austin.\n\n\nIn 1973, started working as an analyst for the Texas Legislative Budget Board.[2]\n\n\nIn 1976, Sharp received a master's degree in Public Administration from Texas State University in San Marcos while working full-time in Austin with the Legislative Budget Board.[3] In 1978, Sharp returned to Victoria, Texas, where he opened a real estate firm with partner and former County Commissioner Gene Martin and became a successful small business owner.\n\n\n\n## Texas politics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains content that is written like an advertisement**. Please help improve it by removing promotional content and inappropriate external links, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a neutral point of view. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nIn 1978, Sharp was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from the 40th District in Victoria and was later named \"Outstanding Freshman\" by *Texas Monthly*. Just a few weeks after his re-election for a third full two-year term in the general election of 1982, he ran and won a special election runoff and served a full four-year term in the Texas Senate. He was appointed to the powerful Senate Finance Committee. In 1986, he was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\n\nIn 1985, while in the state legislature, Sharp proposed a law restricting abortion rights in Texas.[4] Then-State Treasurer Ann Richards helped kill the bill.[5] When he ran for statewide office, Sharp moderated his anti-abortion views.[4]\n\n\nIn 1990, Sharp was elected as the 35th State Comptroller of Public Accounts for the State of Texas. He was re-elected in 1994. In 1998, he did not seek a third term as comptroller but instead lost the race for lieutenant governor to Rick Perry, 50-48 percent. Sharp ran for lieutenant governor again in 2002, but was defeated 52-46 percent by David Dewhurst, then the Land Commissioner.\n\n\nUpon taking office as Comptroller, Sharp began working to fulfill his pledge to \"make government work more like our most successful businesses.\" During his eight years as Comptroller, Sharp established the Texas Performance Review (TPR), an ongoing audit on state government. During Sharp's two 4-year terms as Comptroller, the TPR identified more than $8.5\u00a0billion in taxpayer savings and changed the way government does business through the *Council on Competitive Government*.[6] Other innovative programs created and implemented by Sharp during these eight years included:\n\n\n\n* Texas School Performance Review: An outgrowth of TPR, this program has shown public school districts how to save more than $350\u00a0million, while keeping scarce education funds in the classroom where they belong and easing the burden on local taxpayers.\n* Texas Window on State Government:[7] The official website for the Texas State Comptroller's Agency was a Sharp innovation during his time as Comptroller. This website \u2013 whose stated purpose was to maximize the ability of citizens to engage with the Comptroller's Agency and to access public information more easily \u2013 was the first of its kind in the United States, and has served as a model for other state agencies across the country.\n* The Texas Tomorrow Fund: A pre-paid college tuition plan that allows over 80,000 Texas families to lock in the future costs of their children's college at about what they would pay today.\n* Family Pathfinders: Sharp's 1995 welfare reform plan formed the heart of some of the most sweeping changes to public assistance in Texas history. It also led to another of Sharp's innovations\u2014Family Pathfinders, which links welfare families with local civic clubs, congregations and businesses to help get jobs and leave the public assistance rolls behind. The Family Pathfinders website for Tarrant County, Texas (as an example) is here:[8]\n* The Lone Star Card: First recommended by Sharp in 1991. This program spearheaded the nationwide switch from paper food stamp coupons to computerized bank-type cards and dramatically reduced fraud and abuse in the federal program.\n\n\nAs Comptroller, Sharp also commanded the most successful state lottery start-up in U.S. history. With only 189 employees (compared to California's 1,000 and Florida's 750), Sharp's team put their first tickets on sale seven weeks early and set first-day, first-week, and first-year world sales records. By the time he turned the games over to the new Texas Lottery Commission,[9] the state was $1\u00a0billion richer \u2013 and Sharp had returned $81\u00a0million in unspent administrative funds. Sharp's blueprint for the Texas Lottery was later used by several American states as well as Mexico.\n\n\nIn 2005, Sharp was asked to head an education task force \u2013 called the Texas Tax Reform Commission \u2013 charged with preparing a bi-partisan education plan for the state. The special session convened on April 17, 2006. Sharp accepted the offer and removed himself as a potential candidate for governor in 2006. The task force issued its final plan several months later, and the legislature adopted it.[10] Sharp was later nominated by the *Dallas Morning News* for \"Texan of the Year\".[11]\n\n\n\n### Senate campaign[edit]\n\n\nOn December 4, 2008, Republican U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison announced the creation of an exploratory committee for the Texas governor's race in 2010. Had she won the governorship, Hutchison would have been required to vacate her Senate seat by January 2011. If she were to stay in the Senate and not run for governor, she would have been up for re-election to the Senate in 2012. On December 8, 2008, Sharp became the first Democrat to announce his intention to run for this Senate seat, regardless of Hutchison's decision. Unlike several other candidates for the office, Sharp did not create an exploratory committee but immediately began raising funds and campaigning in 2009.[12]\n\n\n\n## Texas A&M University System[edit]\n\n\nOn August 15, 2011, John Sharp was appointed by Governor Rick Perry and the A&M Board of Regents to be chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. At the time, Sharp had never worked in academia.[2] All the members of the Board of Regents that voted to hire Sharp were appointed by Perry.[13]\n\n\nSharp outsourced the student dining program, landscaping, maintenance, and custodial services to private companies, which prompted protests for university employees who feared losing their jobs.[2] Sharp leased land owned by Texas A&M to private developers.[2]\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Texas A&M has had growth in enrollment.[2]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2023, a guest lecture by Texas A&M University professor Joy Alonzo at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) criticized Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick's role in the opioid crisis. Shortly afterward, Patrick contacted Sharp about Alonzo.[14][15] Alonzo was placed on administrative leave immediately, and was formally censured by UTMB. The investigation by Texas A&M found no evidence of wrongdoing, and Dr. Alonzo's leave was ended two weeks later.[14]\n\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\nAs chancellor of The Texas A&M University System, Sharp has been involved with multiple initiatives:\n\n\n\n* New Partnership Puts Texas A&M on Top, Chancellor Says[16]\n* Texas A&M System and GlaxoSmithKline receive U.S. Government approval to establish influenza vaccine facility in Texas[17]\n* Texas A&M Deal to Outsource Campus Services Formalized[18]\n* Texas A&M System Awarded National Center for Innovation[19]\n* Texas A&M University officially acquires Texas Wesleyan University law school[20]\n* Texas A&M System Launches EmpowerU Website[21]\n* Texas A&M lays accountability path for graduation rates, cost effectiveness[22]\n* Texas A&M System implementing outsourcing at other campuses[23]\n* Texas A&M University System Saving $10 Million of Healthcare[24]\n* Adding \u201cTexas A&M\u201d To More A&M System Agencies[25]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, he married Charlotte Han. They have a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Victoria. Charlotte died in December of 2020.[26]\n\n\nHe owns a 1,600-acre ranch 30 minutes from College Station where he raises cattle and goats.[2]\n\n\nSharp has received numerous awards, including the only \"Texas Quality Award\"[27] ever presented to a governmental agency. Texas State University presented Sharp with the \"Distinguished Alumnus Award\" in 1996, where he also taught a course on Texas state government for several semesters in the early 2000s.[28]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Roell, Craig H.
