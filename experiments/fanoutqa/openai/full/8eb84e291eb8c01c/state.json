It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\nThe university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its highly ranked graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America, and Wharton, the nation's first collegiate business school. Penn's endowment is US$20.7 billion, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2022. In 2020, the university was awarded $1.5 billion in research grants, the fourth-largest of any U.S. university.[14]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation.[15] The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\n\n\nSince its founding, Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty have included 8 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 7 signers of the Constitution, 3 Presidents of the United States, 3 U.S. Supreme Court justices, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, and 9 foreign heads of state. Alumni and faculty include 39 Nobel laureates,[16][17] 4 Turing Award winners,[18] and a Fields Medalist.[19][20][21] Penn has graduated 32 Rhodes Scholars[22] and 21 Marshall Scholars.[23] As of 2022, Penn has the largest number of undergraduate alumni who are billionaires of all colleges and universities (17, counting only Penn's four undergraduate schools).[24] At least (a) 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold),[25][note 3] (b) 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts, [26][27] and (c) 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins of the college[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Academy and College of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Benjamin Franklin\n\n![](image)Benjamin Franklin, founder of the University of Pennsylvania, was the primary founder, benefactor, and a president of the board of trustees for the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\nIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling evangelist who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons.[30] The building was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley and was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time in which it was preached.[31]:\u200a26 The preaching hall was initially intended to also serve as a charity school, but a lack of funds forced plans for the chapel and school to be suspended. \n\n\nAccording to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, \"thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution\". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin, though Peters was one of Penn's founding trustees [1749 to 1776], President of board of trustees [1756 to 1764], and Treasurer of board of trustees [1769 to 1770][32]).\n\n\nNothing further was done by Franklin for another six years when he again contacted not just Peters but many others.[31]:\u200a30 Hence, in the fall of 1749, Franklin circulated a pamphlet titled \"Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania\", his vision for what he called a \"Public Academy of Philadelphia\",[33] which argued for establishing an institution that would provide higher education to its citizens.\n\n\nThe 1749 proposal was seen as innovative at the time, and Franklin organized 24 trustees to help guide the institution he envisioned. The group acquired a dormant building after its owners asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, a new board of trustees took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the Academy of Philadelphia, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, was established and began taking in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,[34]:\u200a12 by the intentions of the original donors, although it lasted only a few years. On June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction.[34]:\u200a13 All three schools shared the same board of trustees and were considered part of the same institution.[35] The first commencement exercises were held on May 17, 1757.[34]:\u200a14\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.[note 4]\n\n\nUnlike the other colonial colleges that existed in 1749, including Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey, Franklin's new school did not focus exclusively on educating clergy. He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\nFranklin assembled a board of trustees from among Philadelphia's leading citizens, the first such non-sectarian board in the nation. At the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 13, 1749, the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House, later renamed and famously known since 1776 as Independence Hall, was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740 by Edmund Woolley for George Whitefield,[48] which was still vacant, was an even more preferable site.\n\n\nThe institution of higher learning was named and known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then provost William Smith's Loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a university, and in 1785 the legislature changed name to University of the State of Pennsylvania.[35][note 5] The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791, the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into a new University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution serving on the new board of trustees.[35]\n\n\nAlthough Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities. Penn has two claims to being the first university in the United States, according to the former university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: \n\n\n\n(1) the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America[52] made Penn the first institution to offer both \"undergraduate\" and professional education (\"the 'de facto' position\")\n(2) the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of \"University\" (\"the 'de jure' position\").[53][54][55]\n### Original campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A circa 1780 sketch of the Academy and College of Philadelphia when its first dormitory (on right) was built\nThe Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church assembly hall building at 4th and Arch Streets, which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Campus as Capital of United States[edit]\n\n\nWhen the British abandoned Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign in the American Revolutionary War, College Hall, the college's only building at the time,[note 6] served as the temporary meeting site of the Second Continental Congress from July 7 to 20, 1778.[56] The British Army, led by General Sir William Howe, damaged many important parts of Philadelphia. Howe's attack caused significant damage to the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, the site where the Second Continental Congress convened and which it was forced to abandon in anticipation of the British attack and occupation of the city.[57]\n\n\nBy July 7, 1778, the Second Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia with the requisite quorum, but convened at College Hall since Independence Hall was damaged by the British attack, briefly establishing Penn's campus as one of the early capitals of the United States.[58][59] Penn's brief status as the nation's capital is evidenced by a July 13, 1778, letter sent from Josiah Bartlett, a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, to John Langdon, who was also a Founding Father from New Hampshire. Langdon, who later became a signatory of the United States Constitution, wrote: \"The Congress meets in the College Hall[note 7] as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City.\"[60]\n\n\n\n### 9th Street campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A c.\u20091815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\nIn 1802, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at Ninth and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the nation's capital.[34]\n\n\nAmong the classes given in 1807 at this building were those offered by Benjamin Rush, a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice who was also a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress,[62][63] and surgeon general of the Continental Army.[64] \nClasses were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect William Strickland designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall[note 8] and Medical Hall (both 1829\u20131830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.\n\n\n\n### West Philadelphia campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of Penn's College Hall from a pocket guide to the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence\n![](image)An illustration of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia from a *Brief Guide to Philadelphia*, published in 1918\nAfter being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the Schuylkill River to property purchased from the Blockley Almshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as University City.\n\n\n\n### Residential university[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1750s, roughly 40 percent of Penn students needed lodging since they came from areas in the U.S. that were too far to commute, or were international students.[65] Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with guardians in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses, such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 student Alexander Graydon.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1765, the campus was expanded by opening of the newly completed dormitory run by Benjamin Franklin's collaborator on the study of electricity using electrostatic machines and related technology and Penn professor and chief master Ebenezer Kinnersley.[note 9] Kinnersley was designated steward of the students in the dormitory and he and his wife were given disciplinary powers over the students and supervised the cleanliness of the students with respect to personal hygiene and washing of the students' dirty clothing.[68][69]\n\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\nStarting in 1849 with formation of Penn's Eta chapter[note 10] of Delta Phi by five founders and 15 initiates,[72] Penn students began to establish residential fraternity houses. Since Penn only had limited housing near campus and since students, especially those at the medical school, came from all over the country, the students elected to fend for themselves rather than live in housing owned by Penn trustees. A number chose housing by pledging and living in Penn's first fraternities, which included Delta Phi, Zeta Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Delta Psi.[73] These first fraternities were located within walking distance of 9th and Chestnut Street since the campus was located from 1800 to 1872 on the west side of Ninth Street, from Market Street on the north to Chestnut Street on the south. Zeta Psi Fraternity was located at the southeast corner of 10th Street and Chestnut Street, Delta Phi was located on the south side of 11th Street near Chestnut Street, and Delta Psi was located on the north side of Chestnut Street, west of 10th Street.[74]\n\n\nWhen Penn moved to West Philadelphia in 1872, the new campus and its associated fraternities centered on the intersection of Woodland Avenue, 36th Street, and Locust Street. Among the first fraternities to build near the new campus were Phi Delta Theta in 1883 and Psi Upsilon in 1891. By 1891, there were at least 17 fraternities at the university.[75]\n\n\nFrom its founding until construction of the Quadrangle Dormitories, which started construction in 1895, the university largely lacked university-owned housing with the exception of a significant part of the 18th century. A significant portion of the undergraduate population commuted from Delaware Valley locations, and a large number of students resided in the Philadelphia area.[76] The medical school, then with roughly half the students, was a significant exception to this trend as it attracted a more geographically diverse population of students. For example, in the 1850s when Penn's medical school accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the student body, over half of the population of the medical school was from the southern part of the United States.[77][78]\n\n\nThe university experienced increased need for housing in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century as it began to compete with peer institutions to recruit foreign students.\n\n\nGeorge Henderson, president of the class of 1889, wrote in his monograph distributed to his classmates at their 20th reunion that Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings it constructed over the prior two decades (along with a near-quadrupling in the size of the student body) was accommodated by building The Quad.[79]\n\n\nHenderson argued that building The Quad was influential in attracting students, and he appealed for it to be expanded:[80]\n\n\n\n\n> And the new buildings? First of all there is need of greater dormitory room. Did you ever live in the \"dorms?\" Then you do not know what \"dorm\" life means for college spirit. Several hundred men who live in the same big family have a feeling of common fellowship. Life in the \"dorms\" develops what our sociologists call a \"Solidarity of Responsibility.\" Men who live there learn to care for the associations that brought them together and that keep them related. And this college spirit they never lose or forget.\n> Some parents, living at a distance, do not like to send their sons to live in a general boarding house. But a dormitory, a University institution, appeals to them, and the boys come and live there. You would scarcely believe it, but when College opened last fall not only were the dormitory rooms over subscribed, but there was a long list of anxious ones, ready to snap up the room of any unlucky fellow who might miss his examinations, and be forced to spend another year at preparatory school grind. So we need the new dormitories, and although they are going up steadily, they might well go up faster.[80]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1911, since it was difficult to house the international students due to the segregation-era housing regulations in Philadelphia and across the United States, the Christian Association at the University of Pennsylvania hired its first Foreign Mission Secretary, Reverend Alpheus Waldo Stevenson.[81] By 1912, Stevenson focused almost all his efforts on the foreign students at Penn who needed help finding housing resulting in the Christian Association buying 3905 Spruce Street located adjacent to Penn's West Philadelphia campus.[82] By January 1, 1918, 3905 Spruce Street officially opened under the sponsorship of the Christian Association as a Home for Foreign Students, which came to be known as the International Students' House with Reverend Stevenson as its first director. The International Students' House provided \" ... counseling and information services for a host of problems foreign students might encounter, including language, financial, health and diet, immigration and technical problems as well as maladjustment to living in the United States. It was also used for recreation and leisure, as lounges had radio, phonograph and television facilities and there were game and reception rooms. The International Students' House also provided for programs including forums, debates, lectures, panels and planned trips and outings as well as weekend activities such as dances, films and game nights. Also, for the next thirty-three years, the International Students' House would be sponsored by the Christian Association of the University of Pennsylvania.\"[83]\n\n\nThe success of efforts to reach out to the international students was reported in 1921 when the university reported that the university's 12,000 students at the time came from all 50 states and 253 came from at least 50 foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and \"...every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations\".[84]\n\n\nBy 1931, first-year students were required to live in the quadrangle unless they received official permission to live with their families or other relatives.[77] However, throughout this period and into the early post-World War II period, the undergraduate schools of the university continued to have a large commuting population.[85] As an example, into the late 1940s, two-thirds of Penn women students were commuters.[86]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the university began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, including its student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1966, there were 54 documented Rowbottom riots, a student tradition of rioting which included everything from car smashing to panty raids.[90] After 1966, there were five more instances of \"Rowbottoms\", the latest occurring in 1980.[90]\n\n\nIn 1965, Penn students learned that the university was sponsoring research projects for the United States' chemical and biological weapons program.[91] According to Herman and Rutman, the revelation that \"CB Projects Spicerack and Summit were directly connected with U.S. military activities in Southeast Asia\", caused students to petition Penn president Gaylord Harnwell to halt the program, citing the project as being \"immoral, inhuman, illegal, and unbefitting of an academic institution\".[91] Members of the faculty believed that an academic university should not be performing classified research and voted to re-examine the university agency which was responsible for the project on November 4, 1965.[91]\n\n\nIn 1983, members of the Animal Liberation Front broke into the Head Injury Clinical Research Laboratory in the School of Medicine and stole research audio and video tapes. The stolen tapes were given to PETA who edited the footage to create a film, *Unnecessary Fuss*. As a result of media coverage and pressure from animal rights activists, the project was closed down.[92]\n\n\nThe school gained notoriety in 1993 for the water buffalo incident in which a student who told a group of mostly black female students to \"shut up, you water buffalo\" was charged with violating the university's racial harassment policy.[93]\n\n\nIn 2022, some asked for the tenure of a University of Pennsylvania law school professor to be revoked after she said the country is \"better off with fewer Asians.\"[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Educational innovations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Houston Hall, the first college student union in the nation\n![](image)Franklin Institute's chief meteorologist Jon Nese (left) and his production crew from WHYY-TV (right) in front of a portion of the original ENIAC computer in the university's ENIAC museum on campus\nPenn's educational innovations include the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the Wharton School, the world's first collegiate business school, in 1881; the first American student union building, Houston Hall, in 1896;[96] the only school of veterinary medicine in the United States that originated directly from its medical school, in 1884;[97][98] and the home of ENIAC, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946. Penn is also home to the oldest continuously functioning psychology department in North America and is where the American Medical Association was founded.[99][100] In 1921, Penn was also the first university to award a PhD in economics to an African American woman, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander.[101]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nIn 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto \"mutilated\" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, *Leges Sine Moribus Vanae*, 'Laws without morals [are] useless'.[102]\nPenn's motto is based on a line from Horace's III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), *quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?*, 'of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?'. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read **Sine Moribus Vanae**. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to *literae sine moribus vanae*, 'Letters without morals [are] useless'.\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1757 seal of the Academy and College of Philadelphia; in 1779, the college was renamed the \"University in Philadelphia\" and, following the end of the Revolutionary War in 1782, assumed its current name, the University of Pennsylvania\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.[103] A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees \"desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation\". In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.[104] The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.[103]\n\n\nThe outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with \"Universitas Pennsylvaniensis\", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, \"Leges Sine Moribus Vanae\".[103]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This statue of Benjamin Franklin, donated to the City of Philadelphia in 1899, now sits in front of College Hall at the center of Penn's main campus in honor of Franklin, the university's founder.[105]\n![](image)A 1915 map of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia, published by Rand McNally[106]\n![](image)Upper Quad Gate forming lower part of Memorial Tower, which honors veterans of the Spanish\u2013American War\n![](image)Center City Philadelphia seen from the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District with Huntsman Hall in the foreground\n![](image)Wistar Institute's seven-story steel and glass 2014 building located next to a brick building, constructed in 1897, both on Penn's main historic campus on North side of Spruce Street between 36th and 37th streets\nMuch of Penn's architecture was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and professors at Penn who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis.[107][108] They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.[109]\n\n\nThe present core campus covers over 299 acres (121\u00a0ha) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph's University (which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia via a merger) and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.\n\n\nThe renowned cancer research center Wistar Institute is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.[110]\n\n\nThe Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (840\u00a0m2) of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres (9.3\u00a0ha) at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, Penn completed the design (with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects) and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory it named *Pennovation Works*. *Pennovation Works* houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a \"pitch bleacher,\" and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, which Penn is formally calling \"South Bank\" (of Schuylkill River), is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that \"South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation.[112]\n\n\n\n### Parks and arboreta[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Penn acquired about 35 acres (14\u00a0ha) between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby 24-acre (9.7\u00a0ha) site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n\nIn September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, 24-acre (9.7\u00a0ha) Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets.\n\n\nPenn maintains two arboreta. The first is the roughly 300-acre (120\u00a0ha) *The Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania* encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks,[113] which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA[114] since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017.[113] Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees.[115] The second arboretum, Penn's Morris Arboretum & Gardens (the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) is 92 acres (sited over 15 miles from Penn's \"Campus Arboretum\") and contains more than 13,000 labelled plants from over 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia \n[116]\n\n\n\n### Bolton Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Bolton Center\n\nPenn also owns the 687-acre (278\u00a0ha) New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school.[117] Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.[118]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nPenn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Lewis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later.\n\n\nPenn library system has grown into a system of 14 libraries with 400 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48\u00a0million.[119] The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books.[8] It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.[120][121]\n\n\nPenn has the following libraries, associated by school or subject area: (1) communications library, located on campus on Walnut Street between 36th and 37th Streets in the Annenberg Communications School; (2) Biddle Law Library, located on campus on 3500 block of Sansom in the Law School; (3) The Holman Biotech Commons library, located on campus, on 3500 block of Hamilton Walk, adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School and the Nursing School; (4) chemistry library, located on campus, on 3300 block of Spruce, in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; (5) dental medicine library located on campus, on 4000 block of Locust Street, in Dental School; (6) fine arts library, located on campus, on 3400 block of Woodland Ave, within the Fisher Fine Arts Library; (7) Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library, located off campus, at 420 Walnut Street, near Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, in Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (14) veterinary medicine library, located on Penn Campus, between 38th and 39th streets on Sansom Street, within the Vet School (with satellite library located off campus at New Bolton Center. Penn also maintains books and records off campus at high density storage facility.\n\n\nThe Penn Design School's Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn's main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.[122][123][124]\n\n\nThe Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839\u20131907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.[125][126]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nVan Pelt Library, Penn's main library building\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior of the reading room at what is now School of Design library.

This 5,900-pound (2,700\u00a0kg) bronze sculpture, which is 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) high and 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house.[130] At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that \"Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty\u2014along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience\u2014to a central crossroad of Penn's campus.\"[131]\n\n\nThe *Covenant*, known to the student body as \"Dueling Tampons\"[132][133] or \"The Tampons\",[134] is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences \"super block\". It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.\n\n\nA white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the *Love* sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.[129]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn[135] two multi-ton sculptures.[136] The two works are *Social Consciousness*[137][135] (created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954 and sited on the walkway between Wharton's Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house) and *Atmosphere and Environment XII* (created by Louise Nevelson in 1970, which is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts).[138]\n\n\nIn addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has a number of more traditional statues including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie.[139] Among the notable sculptures is that of *Young Ben Franklin*, which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled *Benjamin Franklin in 1723* and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War 1 era (1910\u20131914). Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.\n\n\nPenn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin (that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials), and Penn's Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art.[140] Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Penn Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n\n![](image)University Museum and Warden Garden\n![](image)Sphinx of Ramses II at the great temple of Ptah in Memphis, circa 1200 BC\n![](image)Penn Museum's black granite statue of Goddess Sekhmet excavated in Thebes in Ramesseum in the late 18th dynasty of Egypt of 1405 to 1367 BC\nSince the Penn Museum was founded in 1887,[142] it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide.[143] The museum's first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in current day Iraq.[144]\n\n\nPenn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America at about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, and 12.9 tons (made of solid red granite).\n\n\nThe sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.[145]\n\n\nThe museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas.[143] Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.\n\n\nThe Penn Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.\n\n\n\n### Other Penn museums, galleries, and art collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Institute of Contemporary Art, known as ICA, located just South of the Graduate Towers, the residence hall for graduate and professional students at the corner of 36th Street and Sansom Street\nPenn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn's over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years and includes, but is not limited to, paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts.[146] The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983 the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn's art collection[147] and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.\n\n\n\n### Residences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania College Houses\n\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.[148] Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.\n\n\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.[149] Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman[150] (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.[151]\n\n\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council,[152] Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.[153]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe university's first purpose-built dormitory in the foreground (on right), built in 1765[154]\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Upper Quad, originally called The Triangle,[155] and formerly \"The Men's Dormitory\", viewed from the Memorial Tower[156]\n* ![](image)\n\nWoodland Walk pathway between Hill College House and Lauder College House\n* ![](image)\n\nHill College House, a dormitory designed in 1958 to house female students, was designed by Eero Saarinen\n* ![](image)\n\n\"The Quad\", formerly known as the Men's Dormitory, in 2014\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, built by George W.

All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.[157]\n\n\n\n## Academics and interdisciplinary focus[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania graduate and professional schools[158]\n| School\n | Year founded\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Perelman School of Medicine | 1765[159] |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1852[160] |\n| Law School | 1850[note 11] |\n| School of Design | 1868\n |\n| School of Dental Medicine | 1878[162] |\n| The Wharton School | 1881[163] |\n| Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1755[164] |\n| School of Veterinary Medicine | 1884[165] |\n| School of Social Policy and Practice | 1908\n |\n| Graduate School of Education | 1915\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1935\n |\n| Annenberg School for Communication | 1958\n |\n\n\nPenn's \"One University Policy\" allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn's twelve schools.[166] The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).\n\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by *US News* to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[167] Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.[168]\n\n\nFor the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications.[169] *The Atlantic* also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from *U.S. News & World Report*, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), and Wharton business school.\n\n\n\n\n\nFall first-year statistics, by year\n|  | 2022[170] | 2019[171] | 2018[172] | 2017[173] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 54,588\n | 44,961\n | 44,491\n | 40,413\n |\n| Admits\n | 3,404\n | 3,446\n | 3,740\n | 3,757\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 6.24%\n | 7.66%\n | 8.41%\n | 9.30%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 2,417\n | 2,400\n | 2,518\n | 2,456\n |\n| Yield | 68.18%\n | 69.65%\n | 67.33%\n | 65.37%\n |\n| SAT range\\*\n | 1510\u20131560\n | 1450\u20131560\n | 1440\u20131560\n | 1420\u20131560\n |\n| ACT range\\*\n | 34\u201336\n | 33\u201335\n | 32\u201335\n | 32\u201335\n |\n\n\n\\* SAT and ACT ranges are from the 25th to the 75th percentile.\n\n\n\n### Coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith Walk with a view of Towne Building and the Engineering Quad\nPenn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:\n\n\n\n* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business[174]\n* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T)[175]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM)[176]\n* Nursing and Health Care Management (NHCM)[177]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)[178]\n* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS)[179]\n* Singh Program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS)[180]\n* Digital Media Design (DMD)[181]\n* Computer and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence[182]\n* Accelerated 7-Year Bio-Dental Program[183]\n* Accelerated 6-Year Law and Medicine Program[184]\n\n\nDual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.[185][186][187] Penn SP2's vision is: \"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\"[188]\n\n\nOriginally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.[189][190]\n\n\nThe School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.[191]\n\n\n\n### Academic medical center and biomedical research complex[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, Pennsylvania Hospital is now part of University of Pennsylvania Health System and is the earliest established hospital in the United States with the country's oldest surgical amphitheater.\nIn 2018, the university's nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds.[192] That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth.[193] In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in *U.S. News & World Report's* 2020 ranking.[194]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute **Penn Medicine**, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,[195] Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center.[196] Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital.[197] It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre[198] and its first medical library.[199]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Pennsylvania Hospital as painted by Pavel Svinyin in 1811\n* ![](image)\n\nPerelman School of Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn School of Dental Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (facing northwest towards front entrance)\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn owned Princeton Medical Center, eastern facade\n\n\n## Research and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, was founded at Penn in 1946\n![](image)Claudia Cohen Hall, formerly Logan Hall, home of the College of Arts and Sciences and former home of the Wharton School and originally, the medical school\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity.\"[200] Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $14.3\u00a0billion.[201] Penn's research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.442 billion, the fourth largest in the U.S.[202] In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $582.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[203]\n\n\nPenn's research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing,[204] the Center for Global Women's Health at the Nursing School,[205] the $13\u00a0million Morris Arboretum's Horticulture Center,[206] the $15\u00a0million Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton[207] and the $13\u00a0million Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine.[208] With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees.[8] To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the \"Penn Integrates Knowledge\" title awarded to selected Penn professors \"whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge\".[209] These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn's schools.\n\n\nPenn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League, only behind Columbia and Cornell (Harvard did not report data).[210] It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004\u20132007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.[211]\n\n\nIn most disciplines Penn professors' productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology.[212] According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn's 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.[213]\n\n\nPenn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering,[214] the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.\n\n\nIn 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called *The American Law Register,* now the *Penn Law Review*, one of the most cited law journals in the world).[215] Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.[216]\n\n\nThe Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship center in 1973[217] and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which *BusinessWeek* wrote, \"Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education\".[218][219] The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring Gross National Product,[220] the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the \"Wharton Model\"[221] developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-President Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.[220]\n\n\nSeveral major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering.[222] It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.[222]\n\n\nPenn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;[223] the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn;[223] the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers.[223] More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the (a) genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; (b) spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; (c) Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs;[223] and (d)\ngenetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.[224][225] Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.\n\n\nPenn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).\n\n\n\n## Academic profile and

(\"CWUR\") 2020/2021 survey also ranks Penn as the eighth best university in the world.[244] The Princeton Review included Penn in its Dream Colleges list in 2015.[245] As reported by *USA Today*, Penn was ranked first in the United States by College Factual for 2015.[246] In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the 7th happiest students in the United States (the highest in the Ivy League).[247][248]\n\n\nIn their 2021 edition, Penn was ranked tenth in the nation by QS (Quacquarelli Symonds).[249] In the 2020 edition, Penn was ranked 15th in the world by the *QS World University Rankings*[250] and in 2019, 17th by the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU) and 12th by the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. In 2019, it ranked 12th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[251] According to the 2015 ARWU ranking, Penn is also the eighth- and ninth-best university in the world for economics/business and social sciences studies, respectively.[252] University of Pennsylvania ranked 12th among 300 Best World Universities in 2012 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance.[253]\n\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance places Penn in the first tier of the United States' top research universities (tied with Columbia, MIT and Stanford), based on research expenditures, faculty awards, PhD granted and other academic criteria.[254] Penn was also ranked 18th of all U.S. colleges and universities in terms of R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2013 by the National Science Foundation.[255] The High Impact Universities research performance index ranks Penn eighth in the world, whereas the 2010 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (published by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan) ranks Penn 11th in the world for 2007,[256] 2008[257] and 2010[258] and ninth for 2009.[259]\n\n\nThe Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers measures universities' research productivity, research impact, and research excellence based on the scientific papers published by their academic staff. The SCImago Institutions Rankings World Report 2012, which ranks world universities, national institutions and academies in terms of research output, ranks Penn seventh nationally among U.S. universities (2nd in the Ivy League behind Harvard) and 28th in the world overall (the first being France's French National Centre for Scientific Research).[260]\n\n\nThe Mines ParisTech International Professional Ranking, which ranks universities on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies, ranks Penn 11th worldwide and second nationally behind Harvard.[261] According to a *U.S. News* article in 2010, Penn is tied for second (tied with Dartmouth College and Tufts University) for the number of undergraduate alumni who are current Fortune 100 CEOs.[262] *Forbes* ranked Penn 17th, based on a variety of criteria.[263] In 2022, Poets & Quants ranked the undergraduate Wharton business school as the top business school in the nation for the fifth year in a row.[264]\n\n\n\n#### Graduate and professional programs[edit]\n\n\nAmong its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School of Business was ranked number one in 2022,[265] the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary medicine schools rank in the top 5 nationally.[266] Penn's Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023[240] and Design school, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10[266]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEthnic breakdown of enrollment\n| Ethnic enrollment,fall 2018[267] | Number (percentage)of undergraduates\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| African American | 715 (7.1%)\n |\n| Native American | 12 (0.1%)\n |\n| Asian American andPacific Islander | 2,084 (20.7%)\n |\n| Hispanic andLatino American | 1,044 (10.4%)\n |\n| White | 4,278 (42.6%)\n |\n| International | 1,261 (12.6%)\n |\n| Two or more races,non-Hispanic\n | 460 (4.6%)\n |\n| Unknown\n | 179 (1.8%)\n |\n| Total\n | 10,033 (100%)\n |\n\n\n### Demographics and diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aaron Albert Mossell II, the first African American graduate of Penn Law School, at his 1888 graduation\n![](image)Julian Abele, the first African American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design\n![](image)Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in economics in the United States\n![](image)Edgar Fahs Smith, University of Pennsylvania provost from 1911 through 1920\nJonathan and Philip Gayienquitioga, two brothers of the Mohawk Nation,[268] were recruited by Benjamin Franklin to attend the Academy of Philadelphia,[269] making them the first Native Americans at Penn when they enrolled in 1755.[270] Moses Levy, the first Jewish student, enrolled in 1769 (and was also elected Penn's first Jewish trustee in 1802, serving to 1826).[271] Joseph M. Urquiola (aka Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Urquiola y Fern\u00e1ndez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), School of Medicine class of 1829 was the first Latino (from Cuba)[272][273][274] and Auxencio Maria Pena, School of Medicine class of 1836, was the first South American (from Venezuela)[275] to graduate from Penn.\n\n\nWilliam Adger, James Brister, and Nathan Francis Mossell in 1879 were the first African Americans to enroll at Penn. Adger was the first African American to graduate from the college at Penn (1883),[276] and when Brister graduated from the School of Dental Medicine (Penn Dental) (class of 1881), he was the first African American to earn a degree at Penn.[277] Mossell was first African American to graduate from Penn Med (1882)[278] (and had a brother, Aaron Albert Mossell II who was the first African American graduate of University of Pennsylvania Law School (in 1888) and [279] niece, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, Albert's daughter, who not only was first African American woman to graduate from Penn Law (in 1927) and be admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania, but prior to such noteworthy accomplishments was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in the United States (from Penn in 1922)).[280] Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander's uncle (via her mother's Tanner family), Lewis Baxter Moore, in 1896 became the first person of African descent to earn a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania and only the fifth black person in the United States to earn a doctor of philosophy degree[281] and in 1899 founded the Teachers College (now known as the School of Education) of Howard University and served as its dean continuously from 1899 through September 1920.[282]\n\n\nTosui Imadate was the first person of Asian descent to graduate from Penn (College [283] Class of 1879).[284] In 1877, Imadate became the first Asian member of a fraternity at Penn when he became a brother at Phi Kappa Psi.[285] In a quote from a portion of a letter published in December 1880 issue of *The Crescent*, Imadate is described by a Phi Kappa Psi brother as a \"brother member of Penn's I [iota] chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, who is a professor in college at Kiota [(Kyoto, Japan)]\".[286][287]\n\n\nFuji Tsukamoto, Penn Graduate School Class of 1889, became the first woman of Asian descent to matriculate at Penn when she started her study of biology and botany in 1885 and, like Tosui Imadate, also taught at Kyoto college in Japan.[288]\n\n\nMary Alice Bennett and Anna H. Johnson were in 1880 the first women to enroll in a Penn degree-granting program and Bennett was the first woman to receive a degree from Penn, which was a PhD.[289][290][272]\n\n\nJulian Abele in 1902 was the first African American to graduate from University of Pennsylvania School of Design (then named Department of Architecture) and was elected as the president of Penn's Architectural Society.[291] Abele won a 1901 student competition where he designed a Beaux Arts pedestrian gateway that was built and still stands on the campus of Haverford College,[292] The Edward B. Conklin Memorial Gate at the Railroad Avenue entrance to Haverford College.[293] Abele contributed to the design of more than 400 buildings, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University (1912\u20131915), Philadelphia's Central Library (1917\u20131927),[294] and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1914\u20131928).[295] and was the primary designer of the west campus of Duke University (1924\u20131954).[296] Duke honored Abele by prominently displaying his portrait, the first portrait of an African American to be displayed on the campus.[297]\n\n\nSadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, paternal niece of Nathan Francis Mossell and maternal niece of Lewis Baxter Moore, was the first African American to receive a PhD in economics in the United States (and third black woman to earn one in the United States in any subject)[298] and first from Penn in 1921, the first African-American woman to receive a law degree from Penn Law in 1927, and the first African-American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania.[280]\n\n\nAlan L. Hart, who earned a master's degree at Penn Med in radiology (class of 1928),[299][note 12] was born in 1890 and publicly identified as a female, Alberta Lucille Hart, through much of 1917, the year Hart transitioned to being a man by having a hysterectomy, one of the first in the United States to be performed to help a person become a trans man, and lived the rest of his life as a man.[300] Hart, Penn's most prominent transgender alumnus in the first half of the twentieth century, was a pioneer in using x-ray photography to detect tuberculosis, allowing the identification of asymptomatic TB carriers (seventy-five percent of the total infected), permitting treatment of patients before they had complications, and allowing for separation of TB patients from others to stop the spread of one of the more infectious deadly diseases known to humanity.[299]\n\n\nThe first openly LGBTQ+ organization funded by Penn was formed in 1972 by Kiyoshi Kuromiya, a Benjamin Franklin Scholar and Penn alumnus from the College's class of 1966, when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and was also open to non-students and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House program (via a grant from the student government), which was held in Houston Hall at six o'clock in the evening every Wednesday and attracted, on average, roughly sixty people of all ages with roughly \"one-quarter to one-third women and two-thirds to three-quarters men.\"[302] In March 2023, Penn announced a first in the United States LGBTQ+ scholar in residence after a $2-million gift.[303]\n\n\nAs detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910. Penn's first director of publicity, created a recruiting brochure, translated into Spanish, with approximately 10,000 copies circulated throughout Latin America. That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening \"smoker\", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the university by then-vice provost Edgar Fahs Smith (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)[304][305][306][307][308] who spoke about how Penn wanted to \"bring together students of different countries and break down misunderstandings existing between them\".[272]\n\n\nThe success of such efforts were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that\n\n\n\n\n> We have an enrollment at the University of 12,000 students, who have registered from every State in the Union, and 253 students from at least fifty foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and practically all the British possessions except Ireland; every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aGeorge E. Nitzsche, 1921[84]\n> \n\n\nOf those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American.[8] Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students.[8] The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands.[8] The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%).[8] In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.[8]\n\n\nIn the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. Circa 1999 about 28% of the students were Jewish.[309] In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish,[310] which would be approximately 17%[311] of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019\u201320.\n\n\n\n### Penn Face and behavioral health[edit]\n\n\nThe university's social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as \"Penn Face\": students put on a fa\u00e7ade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil.[312][313][314][315][316] Stanford University calls this phenomenon \"Duck Syndrome.\"[315][317] In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016.[318] The school responded by launching a task force.[319][320] The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran.[321][322] In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00\u00a0a.m.[323][324] The university's suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania's standards for university suicide prevention.[325] The university's efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university's counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.[326]\n\n\n\n### Selected student organizations[edit]\n\n\nOldest organization\n![](image)Philomathean Society graduation diploma For Isaac Norton Jr., 1858\n![](image)The Philomathean Society Presidential Library named after United States President and Penn Med alumnus William Henry Harrison\nThe Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is one of the United States' oldest collegiate literary societies and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.[327]\n\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian*\nMain article: The Daily Pennsylvanian\n\n![](image)34th Street logo in 2017\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885.[328] The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II.[328] In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of *The Daily Pennsylvanian* (also known as *The DP*) when the newspaper became its own corporation.[328] *The Daily Pennsylvanian* has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019.[329][330] The *DP* also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called *34th Street Magazine*.\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* also operates three principal websites, thedp.com, 34st.com, and underthebutton.com, and publishes opinion, news, and sports blogs. It has received various collegiate journalism awards.\n\n\n\nAcademic organizations\nSee also: Penn Debate Society and Penn History Review\n\nThe Penn Debate Society (PDS), founded in 1984 as the Penn Parliamentary Debate Society, is Penn's debate team, which competes regularly on the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the international British Parliamentary circuit.[331]\n\n\nThe *Penn History Review* is a journal, published twice a year, through the Department of History, for undergraduate historical research, by and for undergraduates, and founded in 1991.[332][333][334]\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ organizations\nPenn has been ranked as the number one LGBTQ+ friendly school in the country.[335] Penn's LGBTQ+ center is second oldest in the nation[336] and oldest in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as it has been serving the LGBTQ+ community since 1979 by providing support and guidance through 25 groups (including Penn J-Bagel a Jewish LGBTQ+ group, the Lambda Alliance a general LGBTQ social organization, and oSTEM a group for LGBTQ people in STEM fields).[337] Penn offers courses in Sexuality and Gender Studies which allows students to discover and learn queer theory, history of sexual norms, and other gender orientation related courses.[338] The first Penn funded LGBTQ+ organization was formed in 1972 by \"Steve\" Kiyoshi Kuromiya (Penn college class of 1966) when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House via a grant from the student government and the weekly event was held in Houston Hall Wednesday evenings.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Electric Racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Electric Racing unveiled REV8 on March 31, 2023, in front of the Benjamin Franklin statue in front of College Hall.\nPenn Electric Racing is the university's Formula SAE (FSAE) team, competing in the international electric vehicle (EV) competition.

The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas.[347] The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).\n\n\n\n#### Penn Glee Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Glee Club's 1915\u20131916 academic year membership photo\nThe University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States[348] and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. Each year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders (as of April 9, 2021, it merged[349] with Penn Sirens, a previously all female chorale group), clever plots and dialogue, dancing, humor, colorful sets and costumes, and a pit band.[350] The Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students (and men and women from the Penn community are also called upon to fill roles in the pit band and technical staff when the club is involved with theatrical productions). The Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents.[351] Since the 1950s, Penn Glee Club has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Ed McMahon, Carol Lawrence, and Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco and has been showcased on television specials such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at professional sporting events for The Philadelphia Phillies where club sung the National Anthem at the 1993 National League Championship Series. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders. One of the highlights of 1989 was the club's performance for Polish President Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa. Bruce Montgomery, its best-known and longest-serving director, led the club from 1956 until 2000.[352]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Band[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The University of Pennsylvania Band\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania Band at the 2019 homecoming game\nThe University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897.[353] The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation) throughout the year but in past it was known not only as the first college band to perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade but performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the U.S. Marine Band (\"The President's Own\"), Doc Severinsen of *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson*. Beginning in the late 1920s and 1930s Penn Band recorded with the Victor Talking Machine Company (RCA-Victor Company) and was nationally broadcast on WABC (AM). In 1977, Penn Band performed with Chuck Barris of The Gong Show and in 1980 opened for Penn alumnus Maury Povich in his eponymously named show.\n\n\nPenn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and President Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa. By the 1970s, however, Penn Band had begun moving away from the traditional corps style and is now a scramble band. The first one hundred years of the organization's history was described in a book from Arcadia Publishing: *Images of America:The University of Pennsylvania Band* (2006).[353]\n\n\n\n#### Penn's a cappella community[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Masala performs in the Blue Room of the White House in October 2009 on invitation from President Barack Obama.\nThe A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn's a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.[354]\nACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the *Best of College A Cappella* albums.[355] Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world's oldest[356][357] and premier[358][359] South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki Moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi[360] and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan's Urdu classic \"Aap Jaisa Koi\", (originally from the movie *Qurbani*) sung in the movie American Desi.[361]\n\n\nPenn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks' husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in *Pitch Perfect 2*, as Banks reported that Penn's a capella community inspired the film series starring and/or produced by Banks and Handleman.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Comedy organizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mask and Wig clubhouse, also known as the Welsh Coachhouse and Stable, at 310 South Quince Street in Philadelphia; the stable was built between 1843 and 1853, remodeled into a clubhouse by Wilson Eyre Jr. in 1894, altered by Eyre in 1901. The murals were developed by Maxfield Parrish.\nMask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021[363]) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.\n\n\nBloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the \"... nation's first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...\".[364]\nBloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison.[365] In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to \"... anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...\".[366] \nand now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy.[367][368] Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting under garment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers most well known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL's longest-serving female cast member.[369]\n\n\n\n### Religious and spiritual organizations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains academic boosterism which primarily serves to praise or promote the subject** and may be a sign of a conflict of interest.

The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds.[370] Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China[371] and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia.[372] At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.[373]\n\n\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century.[374] Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International,[375][311] which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia).[376] In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980[377]), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.[378]\n\n\n(C) Roman Catholicism:\nThe Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas \"Tom\" J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together;[379] and James Martin SJ (Wharton undergraduate class of 1982[380]). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine *America*,[381] and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.[382][383][384]\n\n\n(D) Hinduism and Jainism:\nPenn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1) 'Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)', a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion,[385] (2) 'Rangoli \u2013 The South Asian Association at Penn' that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry and/or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to \"rekindle the spirit of community\" through events,[386] and (3) 'Penn Hindu & Jain Association', a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993[387][388][389]) and \". . . aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.\"[390]\n\n\n(E) Islam:\nIn 1963, the Muslim Students' Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses.[391][392] Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles[393][394] and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to \"foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.\"[395] The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton's mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam.[396] Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.[397]\n\n\n(F) Buddhism:\nPenn has a Buddhist chaplain[398][399] (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1) is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2) conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3) organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.[400]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers\n\nPenn's sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present.[401][402] The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division\u00a0I (Division\u00a0I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).[403] The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).[404][405][406]\n\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nThe first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans,[407] was organized in 1842 by a member of Philadelphia's prominent Wister family, William Rotch Wister (class of 1846 for Bachelor of Arts and 1849 for Master of Arts).[408] Penn never possessed its own \"ground\" except in 1846 when it leased one day a week, for a total sum of $50, a \"ground\" (located east of the Delaware River).[409][note 13] From 1846 to 1860, there is little evidence of Penn playing cricket but just as Civil War began, Penn students resumed playing cricket matches between classes of Penn students.\n\n\nOn May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College[410][411] and then proceeded to play Haverford for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.\n\n\nAfter Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs (Belmont Cricket Club, the closest to campus at 50th Street and Chester Avenue, Merion Cricket Club, and Germantown Cricket Club), or at Haverford College.[410] Though there is evidence of an occasional game during period 1870 through 1875, none were played against other colleges and there were no yearbook pictures for the three years after 1872 when Penn moved from Center City to University City. Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.[412]\n\n\n\n![](image)George Patterson, president of the University of Pennsylvania cricket team in 1877[410]\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[411] which Cornell University later joined.[403] Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the *de facto* national championship) 23 times (18 solo, 3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924).[413]\n\n\nIn the 1890s Penn's cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles.[414] In July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[403] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[415]\n\n\nCricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club, and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\n\nPerhaps the university's most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.[416]\n\n\nFollowing the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline (as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months and Imperial Cricket Conference, Cricket's \"... international governing body and forerunner to the current International Cricket Conference (ICC), introduced a regulation making it clear that only countries within the British empire were welcome to compete\")[409] such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.[417]\n\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's eight-oared crew in 1901, the first foreign crew to reach the final of the Grand Challenge Cup[418] at Henley Royal Regatta\n![](image)Joe Burk, Wharton School class of 1934 and crew coach from 1950 to 1969, was named the \"world's greatest oarsman\" in 1938[419]\nRowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an open weight women's team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn's first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912.[420] During the course of Ward's coaching career at Penn his \"... Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.\"[421] Importantly, Ward coached Penn's 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).[422]\n\n\nPenn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.[423]\n\n\nJoe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation's best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men's Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.\n\n\nOther Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:\n(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men's coxed eight which earned a bronze medal[424] and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men's coxless pair),\n(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women's 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),\n(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team),[425] \n(d) Rusty Callow, \n(e) Harry Parker,\n(f) Ted Nash,[423] and\n(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award[426] for being nation's best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).\n\n\nThe Penn men's crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton class of 1992)[427] won the bronze medal in Men's Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[428] The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No.11 Boathouse Row.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1878 Penn Rugby team[429]\n![](image)John Heisman, a University of Pennsylvania Law School class of 1892 alumnus and rugby football player, posing at Penn in 1891 holding elongated ellipsoidal rugby ball and gestures resembling the famed \"Heisman Pose\"[430]\n![](image)Lithograph of University of Pennsylvania rugby player in 1907\nThe Penn men's rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and Association football code rules (relative to American football rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented[404]). Among its earliest games was a game against College of New Jersey (which in 1895 changed its name to Princeton) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.[431][404] Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools.[432]\n\n\nAmong the prominent alumni to play in a 19th century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[433]\n\n\nHeisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football.[434] One of Heisman's teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893[435] (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).[436]\n\n\nIn 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn[437] (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s[438]) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Frank Nicholson (rugby union)) University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (class of 1910),[439] who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.[440]\n\n\n\nPenn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, *Daily Pennsylvanian* article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo[441] that rugby per rugby union code was played.\n\n\n> Such is the devotion to English rugby football on the part of University of Pennsylvania's students from New Zealand, Australia, and England that they meet on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock every morning and practice the game. The varsity track and football squads monopolize the field to such an extent that the early hours of the morning are the only ones during which the rugby enthusiasts can play. Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, ('11), dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail.[442]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master's degree at Wharton.[443]\n\n\nThough Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934,[444] there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry \"Joe\" Edwin Reagan III[445] Penn's College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. \"Rusty\" D'Arconte Penn's College class of 1966[446] Thus, with D'Arconte's hustle and Reagan's charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.\n\n\nIn spring of 1984[447][448] Penn women's rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985 who subsequently became the women's representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998),[449] Club President Marianne Seligson, and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn,[450] began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick,[451] a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.\n\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at PPL Park (now known as Subaru Park) in Philadelphia and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17\u201312 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14\u201312 win over the University of Texas.[454]\n\n\nPenn men's rugby, as of 2020,[455] is coached by Tiger Bax,[456] a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens[457] and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.\n\n\nPlayers on the 2019 men's team came from 11 countries: Australia, Botswana, Chile, Great Britain, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, South Africa, and the United States).\n\n\nPenn's graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present.[458] The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III[459] Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice,[460] and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart[461] who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.[462] Other recent Penn Rugby Alumni include Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team (and had an additional year of eligibility allowing him to continue to playing for undergraduate team while a student at Penn Law per USA Rugby rules), and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers football\n\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, also known as Concrete Charlie was a three-time All-American at Penn who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the first player selected in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to win the 1960 NFL Championship and was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPenn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.[431]\n\n\nPenn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.[431] Among the key players on the teams from 1897 to 1900 was Truxton Hare, Sr. who was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. While primarily a guard, he also ran, punted, kicked off, and drop-kicked extra points.\n\n\nThe achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.\n\n\nAlso, each year the Bednarik Award is given to college football's best defensive player. Chuck Bednarik (class of 1949) was a three-time All-American center/linebacker who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American tackle George Savitsky and three-time All-American halfback Skip Minisi. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, as was their coach, George Munger (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.\n\n\nPenn's game against University of California at Berkeley on September 29, 1951 (in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field), was first college football game to be broadcast in color.[463][464]\nESPN's *College GameDay* traveled to Penn to highlight the Harvard\u2013Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's ice hockey\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania team in front of photo of College Hall in 1896\u201397, its first season of existence, featuring George Orton, the future winner of gold medal in the 1900 Summer Olympics 2500 meter steeplechase (top row, second from the end of the right side\nPenn's first ice hockey team competed during the 1896\u201397 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898\u201399. On the first team in 1896\u201397 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the first disabled person to compete in the Olympics). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II,[465] is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[466]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's basketball\n\nPenn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&M.

Whitham (seated)\nAt least 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold).[25][note 14] Penn won more of its \"medals\"[25] (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.[469] Penn's track and field alumni who won 21 'medals' at the 1900 Paris Olympics are: (1) Alvin Kraenzlein (University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine class of 1900),[470] known as \"the father of the modern hurdling technique\",[471] who was first sportsman in the history of Olympic games to win four individual gold medals in a single discipline;[472][473] (2) Josiah McCracken, MD (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine class of 1901) who won the silver medal in the shot put and a bronze medal for the hammer throw;[474][475][476] (3) John Walter Tewksbury (Penn Dental School class of 1899) who won five 'medals' (gold in the 200 meter dash and 400 meter hurdles, silver in the 60 meter dash and 100 meter dash, and a bronze in the 200 meter hurdles);[477] (4) Irving Baxter (Penn Law class of 1901) who won five medals, including gold in both the men's high jump and men's pole vault and silver in all three of the standing jumps (long, triple, and high);[478][479] (5) Meredith Colket (College Class of 1901 (BS), Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the pole vault,[480] (6) Truxton Hare (Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the hammer throw[481] (and at 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, won (i) bronze medal in the all-around discipline (which consisted of 100 yard run, shot put, high jump, 880 yard walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yard hurdles, long jump and one mile run), and (ii) gold medal as part of United States tug of war team),[481] and (7) George Orton (University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Arts and Sciences class of 1894 (MA) and class of 1896 (PhD)) who (as first physically disabled Olympic athlete) won a gold 'medal' in the 2,500 meter run and a bronze metal in the 400 meter hurdles[482]\n\n\nThe first African American in the United States to win an Olympic gold medal at an Olympics, the 1908 London Olympics, as part of Medley relay where he ran the third leg, the 400 meters, was John Taylor (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (class of 1908)). Taylor was followed by William Hamilton and Nate Cartmell (fellow Penn athlete).[468]\n\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, in summer of 2021, nine Penn students and alumni played in six different sports from six different countries.[483]\n\n\n\n### Curling[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3).[484][485] Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.[486]\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's Franklin Field, in photograph taken shortly after completion of the upper deck in 1925.\nFranklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593,[487] is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the (a) oldest stadium still operating for college football games,[488] (b) first stadium to sport two tiers,[489] (c) first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, (d) second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football (in 1922 as Pitt versus West Virginia was broadcast in 1921), (e) first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast (in 1940),[487] and (f) first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color (on September 29, 1951).[490] Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970 (where installation of artificial turf in 1969 caused it to be first NFL stadium to have such artificial turf),[487] and was the site of 18 Army\u2013Navy games between 1899 and 1935.[491]\n\n\nIt is currently also used by Penn students for recreation such as intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket. Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.[492]\n\n\nPenn's home court, the Palestra, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing.\n\n\nPenn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium (for both women's and men's soccer, which includes elevated stands for 650 spectators, a 180-degree rotating scoreboard, and the Rapaport Family Suite), the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field (with special artificial turf), and Irving \"Moon\" Mondschein Throwing Complex (for javelin, shot put, discus, and Hammer throw).[493] In addition, Penn baseball plays its home games at Meiklejohn Stadium at Murphy Field.\n\n\nPenn's Class of 1923 Arena (with seating for up to 3,000 people) was built to host the University of Pennsylvania Varsity Ice Hockey Team, which has been disbanded, and now hosts or in the past hosted: (a) Penn's Men's and Penn Women's club ice hockey teams, (b) practices and/or exhibition games for the Philadelphia Flyers, Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes, (c) roller hockey for the Philadelphia Bulldogs professional team, and (d) rock concerts such as one in 1982 featuring Prince.[494][495][496]\n\n\nThe Olympic Boycott Games of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics following the Soviet incursion in Afghanistan. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.\n\n\n\n![](image)Palestra interior in 2016\n![](image)Exterior of the Palestra in April 2007\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Pennsylvania people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father; one of the drafters and signers of the Declaration of Independence; 1st Postmaster General](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Founding Father; one of the drafters and signers of the Declaration of Independence; 1st Postmaster General\n* ![Francis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.](image)\n\nFrancis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.\n* ![George Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain](image)\n\nGeorge Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain\n* ![Benjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army](image)\n\nBenjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army\n* ![William Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States](image)\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States\n* ![Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States](image)\n\nDonald Trump, 45th president of the United States\n* ![Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]](image)\n\nJoe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]\n* ![Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the civil rights movement, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Cordero, former Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter, and former Pennsylvania governor and DNC chair Ed Rendell.[510]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also served in several positions in the United States cabinet. Notable alumni include Secretary of Defense Thomas S. Gates; US Attorney Generals Henry Dilworth Gilpin, Caesar Augustus Rodney, and George W. Wickersham; Secretaries of the Treasury Robert John Walker and William M. Meredith; Secretaries of Labor Ann Dore McLaughlin and Frances Perkins  (the longest serving Secretary of Labor and first woman to serve in a Presidential Cabinet); six Secretaries of the Navy; a Surgeon General of the United States, C.

Roberts and James Wilson; Supreme Court justices of foreign states (e.g., Ronald Wilson of the High Court of Australia, Ayala Procaccia of the Israel Supreme Court, Yvonne Mokgoro, former justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa); and Irish Court of Appeal justice Gerard Hogan).\n\n\nPenn is also a top feeder school for careers in finance and investment banking on Wall Street[511] and its alumni have a strong presence in financial and economic life. Penn alumni include 64 living billionaires, 28 of whom are undergraduate alumni billionaires (as Penn has the second highest number of undergrad billionaire alumni with only Harvard [with only one more (but Penn undergraduate alumni billionaires have accumulated over 65 billion more in wealth than Harvard's)],[512][513] Penn alumni who received federal aid, 10 years after starting at Penn, have the highest median incomes among alumni of Ivy League schools[514] and\nPenn has educated many governors/leaders of national central banks including Dawne Williams ( St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla National Bank), Yasin Anwar (Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan), Ignazio Visco (Governor of the Bank of Italy), Kim Choongsoo (Governor of Bank of Korea), Zeti Akhtar Aziz (Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia), Pridiyathorn Devakula (governor, Bank of Thailand, and former minister of finance), Farouk El Okdah (Central Bank of Egypt), John Moran (Secretary General of the Department of Finance (Ireland)), Alfonso Prat Gay (President of the Central Bank of Argentina and leader of Ministry of Economy (Argentina)), and the director of the United States National Economic Council, Gene Sperling.[515] Other alumni include Warren Buffett [note 15] (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway),[505] Steven A.

Roberts (co-founder of Comcast); Elon Musk (co-founder of PayPal, Tesla, OpenAI and Neuralink, founder of SpaceX and The Boring Company); Leonard Bosack (co-founder of Cisco); David J. Brown (co-founder of Silicon Graphics) and Mark Pincus (founder of Zynga, the company behind FarmVille).\n\n\nAmong other distinguished alumni are the current or past presidents of over one hundred universities including Harvard University (Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's first female president), Cornell University (Martha E. Pollack), Penn (Judith Rodin, first female president in the Ivy League), Princeton University (Harold Dodds), the University of California (Mark Yudof), Carnegie Mellon University (Jared Cohon), and Northwestern University (Morton O. Schapiro).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPenn's alumni also include poets William Augustus Muhlenberg, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams; civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.; linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky;[505] architect Louis Kahn; cartoonist Charles Addams; actresses Candice Bergen and Elizabeth Banks; journalist Joe Klein; and fashion designer Tory Burch.\n\n\nPenn alumni have won (a) 53 Tony Awards,[517][518] (b) 17 Grammy Awards,[519] (c) 25 Emmy Awards,[520][521] (d) 13 Academy Awards (and one alumnus[522] who has earned all four awards, known as an EGOT).[note 16] as exemplified by EGOT recipient, recording artist John Legend.[523]\n\n\nWithin the ranks of Penn's graduates, faculty, and/or trustees are also eight signers of the Declaration of Independence[524][525] and seven signers of the United States Constitution[526] and 24 members of the Continental Congress. These historic figures include George Clymer, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas McKean, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Ross, Benjamin Rush, James Wilson, Thomas Fitzsimons, Jared Ingersoll, Rufus King, Thomas Mifflin, Gouverneur Morris and Hugh Williamson.[527][528] Penn alumni include 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, and 28 State Supreme Court justices.[529]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also had a significant impact on the United States military as they include Samuel Nicholas, United States Marine Corps founder, and William A. Newell, whose congressional action formed a predecessor to the current United States Coast Guard,[530]:\u200ap.1 col.5 \u2013 p.2 col.1 and numerous alumni have become generals or similar rank in the United States Armed Forces. At least 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts[531][532] and 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\nAs of 2023, there have been 38 Nobel laureates affiliated (see List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation) with the University of Pennsylvania,[533][505][16] of whom four are current faculty members and eight are alumni.[*citation needed*] Penn also educated members of the United States National Academies and the Academy of Arts and Sciences,[*citation needed*] eight National Medal of Science laureates, numerous Sloan Fellows, several members of the American Philosophical Society, many Guggenheim Fellowships, several Pulitzer Prize winners, four Turing Award winners, and a Fields Medalist[534] [535] [536][537][538]\n\n\n\n### Alumni relations and inter-Ivy events[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to active alumni chapters globally, in 1989, the university bought a 14-story clubhouse building (purpose-built for Yale Club) in New York City from Touro College for $15 million[539] to house Penn's largest alumni chapter. After raising a separate $25 million (including $150,000+ donations each from such alumni as Estee Lauder heirs Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Michael Milken, Donald Trump, and Ronald Perelman) and two years of renovation,[540] the Penn Club of New York moved to its current location at 30 West 44th Street on NYC's Clubhouse Row[541] across the street from the Harvard Club of New York City, a block west of the Cornell Club of New York, and two blocks west of the Yale Club of New York City. It also is one block north of the (closed due to bank default[542] in 2021) former Princeton Club of New York and joins with those clubs in inter-Ivy events. Although its university is located in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, the Columbia University Club of New York does not have its own clubhouse and shares the 30 West 44th Street clubhouse with the Penn Club. The New York region of Columbia maintains an office in the Penn Club.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* List of universities by number of billionaire alumni\n* Education in Philadelphia\n* Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP)\n* University of Pennsylvania Press\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** It was not until 1785 that the name was made official as between 1779 and 1785 name was simply \"University\" in Philadelphia see \"Statutes of the Trustees\". University of Pennsylvania. Retrieved September 12, 2022.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The university officially uses 1740 as its founding date and has since 1899. The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706\u20131790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n3. **^** See list of University of Pennsylvania people athletics section for list of Penn Olympic medal winners, replete with hyperlinks.\n4. **^**  Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. This formalized protocol included a provision that established academic processions and placed visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's *The Alumni Register* magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, the university's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, altering its rank in academic processions and offering the informal bragging rights associated with the age-based hierarchy in academia.[36] Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale,[37][38] Further complicating the comparison, a University of Edinburgh-educated Presbyterian minister from Scotland, William Tennent, and his son Gilbert Tennent operated a Log College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with it, including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became president of Princeton. All 12 members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the New Side or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church in the New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania areas.[39] This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify placing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, which would make it earlier than Penn's 1740 founding. However, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\nEven Penn's account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add the College of Philadelphia until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began in the colonial era, such as St. John's College, which was founded as King William's School in 1696, and the University of Delaware, which was founded as the Free Academy in 1743, choose to utilize the dates they became institutions of higher learning. Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896\u20131899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date. According to Cheyney's later recollection, the university considered its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the U.S. Commissioner of Education written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the university's first educational trust. Cheyney states that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the Massachusetts General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts at the time of its founding, resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a school or college. Princeton claims its founding date is 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original of the charter is known to exist. Except for Columbia University, the majority of colonial-era colleges and universities do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.[45]\n5. **^** \"...(d) On November 27, 1779, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed an act for the establishment of a University incorporating the rights and powers of the College, Academy, and Charitable School.

In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

January 6, 1705][Note 1]\u00a0\u2013 April 17, 1790) was an American polymath who was active as a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher, and political philosopher.[1] Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence, and the first postmaster general.[2]\n\n\nFranklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the *Pennsylvania Gazette* at age 23.[3] He became wealthy publishing this and *Poor Richard's Almanack*, which he wrote under the pseudonym \"Richard Saunders\".[4] After 1767, he was associated with the *Pennsylvania Chronicle*, a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the policies of the British Parliament and the Crown.[5]\n\n\nHe pioneered and was the first president of the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired as the first U.S. ambassador to France and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco\u2013American relations. His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing French aid.\n\n\nHe was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies on August 10, 1753,[6] having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania. At some points in his life, he owned slaves and ran \"for sale\" ads for slaves in his newspaper, but by the late 1750s, he began arguing against slavery, became an active abolitionist, and promoted education and the integration of African Americans into U.S. society.\n\n\nAs a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his studies of electricity, and for charting and naming the Gulf Stream current. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among others.[7] He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, Philadelphia's first fire department,[8] and the University of Pennsylvania.[9]\nFranklin earned the title of \"The First American\" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity. Foundational in defining the American ethos, Franklin has been called \"the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.\"[10]\n\n\nHis life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on the $100 bill, warships, and the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as numerous cultural references and with a portrait in the Oval Office. Over his lifetime, Franklin wrote or received more than 30,000 letters and other documents, which since the 1950s have been collected in *The Papers of Benjamin Franklin*, published by both the American Philosophical Society and Yale University.\n\n\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin's father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler, soaper, and candlemaker. Josiah Franklin was born at Ecton, Northamptonshire, England, on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith and farmer, and his wife, Jane White. Benjamin's father and all four of his grandparents were born in England.[11]\n\n\nJosiah Franklin had a total of seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and emigrated with her to Boston in 1683; they had three children before emigration and four after. Following her death, Josiah married Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689, in the Old South Meeting House by Reverend Samuel Willard, and had ten children with her. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child overall, and his tenth and final son.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin's mother, Abiah, was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts Bay Colony, on August 15, 1667, to Peter Folger, a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, Mary Morrell Folger, a former indentured servant. Mary Folger came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to Massachusetts for religious freedom, sailing for Boston in 1635 after King Charles I of England had begun persecuting Puritans. Her father Peter was \"the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.\"[12] As clerk of the court, he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n### Boston[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAn 1881 illustration of Franklin's birthplace on Milk Street in Boston\n![](image)\nA May 2008 photograph of Franklin's birthplace in Boston, commemorated with a bust of Franklin atop the building's second-floor fa\u00e7ade\n\nFranklin was born on Milk Street in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay on January 17, 1706,[Note 1] and baptized at the Old South Meeting House in Boston. As a child growing up along the Charles River, Franklin recalled that he was \"generally the leader among the boys\".[15]\n\n\nFranklin's father wanted him to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although \"his parents talked of the church as a career\"[16] for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James, a printer, who taught him the printing trade. When Benjamin was 15, James founded *The New-England Courant*, which was the third newspaper founded in Boston.[17]\n\n\nWhen denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of \"Silence Dogood\", a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood's letters were published and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the *Courant*'s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Benjamin when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood proclaim, quoting *Cato's Letters*, \"Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech\".[18] Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother's permission, and in so doing became a fugitive.[19]\n\n\n\n### Move to Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nAt age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived, he worked in several printing shops in Philadelphia, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects in any of these jobs. After a few months, while working in one printing house, Pennsylvania governor Sir William Keith convinced him to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Discovering that Keith's promises of backing a newspaper were empty, he worked as a typesetter in a printer's shop in what is the present-day Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great in the Smithfield area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed him as a clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.[20][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Junto and library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*La scuola della economia e della morale*, an 1825 sketch of Franklin\nIn 1727, at age 21, Franklin formed the Junto, a group of \"like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community\". The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.[21] The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.[22][23]\n\n\nReading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.[24][*page\u00a0needed*]\n> \n> \n\n\nThis did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a subscription library, which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia, whose charter he composed in 1731.[25]\n\n\n\n### Newspaperman[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early American publishers and printers\n\n![](image)Franklin (center) at work on a printing press in a painting published by the Detroit Publishing Company in c.\u20091914\nUpon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, he set up a printing house in partnership with Hugh Meredith; the following year he became the publisher of *The Pennsylvania Gazette*, a newspaper in Philadelphia. The *Gazette* gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after he achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'[20]\n\n\nIn 1732, he published the first German-language newspaper in America \u2013 *Die Philadelphische Zeitung* \u2013 although it failed after only one year because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market.[26] Franklin also printed Moravian religious books in German. He often visited Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, staying at the Moravian Sun Inn.[27] In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the Thirteen Colonies, he called the Pennsylvania Germans \"Palatine Boors\" who could never acquire the \"Complexion\" of Anglo-American settlers and referred to \"Blacks and Tawneys\" as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although he apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.[28]\n\n\nAccording to Ralph Frasca, Franklin promoted the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through the construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. He thereby invented the first newspaper chain.[*citation needed*] It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers he believed that the press had a public-service duty.[29][30]\n\n\nWhen he established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two \"wretched little\" news sheets, Andrew Bradford's *The American Weekly Mercury*, and Samuel Keimer's *Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette*.[31] This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from *Chambers's Universal Dictionary*. Franklin quickly did away with all of this when he took over the *Instructor* and made it *The Pennsylvania Gazette*. The *Gazette* soon became his characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first, he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called \"The Busy-Body\", which he wrote for Bradford's *American Mercury* in 1729, followed the general Addisonian form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the women who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as Isaac Bickerstaff had been in the *Tatler*. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the \"sowre Philosopher\", is evidently a portrait of his rival, Samuel Keimer.[32][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nFranklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue. Over the years he sponsored two dozen printers in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, New York, Connecticut and even the Caribbean. By 1753, 8 of the 15 English language newspapers in the colonies were published by him or his partners.[33] He began in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1731. After his second editor died, the widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success. She was one of the colonial era's first woman printers.[34] For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter Timothy, who took over the *South Carolina Gazette* in 1746.[35] The *Gazette* was impartial in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain.[36] However, Franklin's *Connecticut Gazette* (1755\u201368) proved unsuccessful.[37] As the Revolution approached, political strife slowly tore his network apart.[38]\n\n\n\n### Freemasonry[edit]\n\n\nIn 1730 or 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local Masonic lodge. He became a grand master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania.[39][40] The same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of James Anderson's *Constitutions of the Free-Masons*. He was the secretary of St. John's Lodge in Philadelphia from 1735 to 1738.[40] Franklin remained a Freemason for the rest of his life.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### Common-law marriage to Deborah Read[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDeborah Read Franklin, Franklin's common-law wife, c.\u20091759\n![](image)\nSarah Franklin Bache (1743\u20131808), the daughter of Franklin and Deborah Read\n\nAt age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old Deborah Read while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Deborah's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor Keith's request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.[20]\n\n\nWhile Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with the governor's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to Barbados with her dowry, leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of bigamy laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFranklin established a common-law marriage with Deborah on September 1, 1730. They took in his recently acknowledged illegitimate young son and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, Francis Folger Franklin, was born in October 1732 and died of smallpox in 1736. Their daughter, Sarah \"Sally\" Franklin, was born in 1743 and eventually married Richard Bache.[43]\n\n\nDeborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe; another possible reason why they spent much time apart is that he may have blamed her for possibly preventing their son Francis from being inoculated against the disease that subsequently killed him.[44] Deborah wrote to him in November 1769, saying she was ill due to \"dissatisfied distress\" from his prolonged absence, but he did not return until his business was done.[45] Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke on December 14, 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to Great Britain; he returned in 1775.[46]\n\n\n\n### William Franklin[edit]\n\n\nMain article: William Franklin\n\n![](image)William Franklin (1730\u20131813), Franklin's son, whose mother was unknown, was born out of wedlock on February 22, 1730\nIn 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged his illegitimate son William and raised him in his household. William was born on February 22, 1730, but his mother's identity is unknown.[47] He was educated in Philadelphia and beginning at about age 30 studied law in London in the early 1760s. William himself fathered an illegitimate son, William Temple Franklin, born on the same day and month: February 22, 1760.[48] The boy's mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. In 1762, the elder William Franklin married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a planter from Barbados, in London. In 1763, he was appointed as the last royal governor of New Jersey.\n\n\nA Loyalist to the king, William Franklin saw his relations with father Benjamin eventually break down over their differences about the American Revolutionary War, as Benjamin Franklin could never accept William's position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was placed under house arrest at his home in Perth Amboy for six months. After the Declaration of Independence, he was formally taken into custody by order of the Provincial Congress of New Jersey, an entity which he refused to recognize, regarding it as an \"illegal assembly\".[49] He was incarcerated in Connecticut for two years, in Wallingford and Middletown, and, after being caught surreptitiously engaging Americans into supporting the Loyalist cause, was held in solitary confinement at Litchfield for eight months. When finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778, he moved to New York City, which was occupied by the British at the time.[50]\n\n\nWhile in New York City, he became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists, a quasi-military organization chartered by King George III and headquartered in New York City. They initiated guerrilla forays into New Jersey, southern Connecticut, and New York counties north of the city.[51] When British troops evacuated from New York, William Franklin left with them and sailed to England. He settled in London, never to return to North America. In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain, \"...\u00a0Benjamin Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin.\"[52][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\n### Success as an author[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The January 1741 edition of *The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle*, Franklin's magazine\nIn 1733, Franklin began to publish the noted *Poor Richard's Almanack* (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. He frequently wrote under pseudonyms. He had developed a distinct, signature style that was plain, pragmatic and had a sly, soft but self-deprecating tone with declarative sentences.[53] Although it was no secret that he was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. \"Poor Richard's Proverbs\", adages from this almanac, such as \"A penny saved is twopence dear\" (often misquoted as \"A penny saved is a penny earned\") and \"Fish and visitors stink in three days\", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and his readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year\u2014it became an institution.[54] In 1741, Franklin began publishing *The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America.* He used the heraldic badge of the Prince of Wales as the cover illustration.\n\n\nIn 1758, the year he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed *Father Abraham's Sermon*, also known as *The Way to Wealth*. Franklin began writing his autobiography in 1771, but it was not published until after his death. It has become one of the classics in the genre of autobiographical non-fiction.[*citation needed*] Franklin wrote a letter, \"Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress\", dated June 25, 1745, in which he gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges. Due to its licentious nature, it was not published in collections of his papers during the 19th century. Federal court rulings from the mid-to-late 20th century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws and against censorship.[55]\n\n\n\n## Public life[edit]\n\n\n### Early steps in Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A portrait of Franklin c. 1746\u20131750,[Note 2] by Robert Feke widely believed to be the earliest known painting of Franklin[56][57]\n![](image)*Join, or Die*, a 1754 political cartoon by Franklin, urged the colonies to join the Seven Years' War in the French and Indian War; the cartoon was later resurrected, serving as an iconic symbol in support of the American Revolution.\n![](image)In 1751, Franklin co-founded Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, one of the first hospitals in the United States, depicted in this 1755 engraving by William Strickland.\n![](image)Seal of the College of Philadelphia, a college founded by Franklin that is now the University of Pennsylvania\n![](image)Sketch of the original Tun Tavern\nIn 1736, Franklin created the Union Fire Company, one of the first volunteer firefighting companies in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for New Jersey based on innovative anti-counterfeiting techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, he was an advocate for paper money, publishing *A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency* in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped deflation without causing excessive inflation. In 1766, he made a case for paper money to the British House of Commons.[58]\n\n\nAs he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for the Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. Richard Peters, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749 when he printed his own pamphlet, *Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.*[59]:\u200a30 He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the academy and the charity school opened in 1751.[60]\n\n\nIn 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.[20]\n\n\nDuring King George's War, Franklin raised a militia called the Association for General Defense because the legislators of the city had decided to take no action to defend Philadelphia \"either by erecting fortifications or building Ships of War\". He raised money to create earthwork defenses and buy artillery. The largest of these was the \"Association Battery\" or \"Grand Battery\" of 50 guns.[61][62]\n\n\nIn 1747, Franklin (already a very wealthy man) retired from printing and went into other businesses.[63] He formed a partnership with his foreman, David Hall, which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made many new discoveries.\n\n\nFranklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman; in June 1749, he became a justice of the peace for Philadelphia; and in 1751, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. On August 10, 1753, he was appointed deputy postmaster-general of British North America. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.[20]\n\n\nIn 1751, Franklin and Thomas Bond obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. Pennsylvania Hospital was the first hospital in the colonies.[64] In 1752, Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship, the Colonies' first homeowner's insurance company.[65][66]\n\n\nBetween 1750 and 1753, the \"educational triumvirate\"[67] of Franklin, Samuel Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, and schoolteacher William Smith built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what Bishop James Madison, president of the College of William & Mary, called a \"new-model\"[68] plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of moral philosophy by Samuel Johnson, titled *Elementa Philosophica*,[69] to be taught in the new colleges. In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.[70] They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.[71] Johnson went on to found King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a Bachelor of Arts and one with a Master of Arts. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania. The college was to become influential in guiding the founding documents of the United States: in the Continental Congress, for example, over one-third of the college-affiliated men who contributed to the Declaration of Independence between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the college.[72]\n\n\nIn 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the Board of Trade in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.[73]\n\n\nIn 1753, both Harvard[74] and Yale[75] awarded him honorary master of arts degrees.[76] In 1756, he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from the College of William & Mary.[77] Later in 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia. He used Tun Tavern as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies.[78]\n\n\n\n### Postmaster[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first U.S. postage stamp, issued in 1847 in honor of Franklin\n![](image)A Pass, signed by Postmaster General Benjamin Franklin, gave William Goddard the authority to travel as needed to investigate and inspect postal routes and protect the mail.[79]\nWell known as a printer and publisher, Franklin was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher William Hunter were named deputy postmasters\u2013general of British North America, the first to hold the office. (Joint appointments were standard at the time, for political reasons.) He was responsible for the British colonies from Pennsylvania north and east, as far as the island of Newfoundland. A post office for local and outgoing mail had been established in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by local stationer Benjamin Leigh, on April 23, 1754, but service was irregular. Franklin opened the first post office to offer regular, monthly mail in Halifax on December 9, 1755. Meantime, Hunter became postal administrator in Williamsburg, Virginia, and oversaw areas south of Annapolis, Maryland. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system and improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. By 1761, efficiencies led to the first profits for the colonial post office.[80]\n\n\nWhen the lands of New France were ceded to the British under the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the British province of Quebec was created among them, and Franklin saw mail service expanded between Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec City, and New York. For the greater part of his appointment, he lived in England (from 1757 to 1762, and again from 1764 to 1774)\u2014about three-quarters of his term.[81] Eventually, his sympathies for the rebel cause in the American Revolution led to his dismissal on January 31, 1774.[82]\n\n\nOn July 26, 1775, the Second Continental Congress established the United States Post Office and named Franklin as the first United States postmaster general. He had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position.[83] He had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed postmaster general, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. His apprentice, William Goddard, felt that his ideas were mostly responsible for shaping the postal system and that the appointment should have gone to him, but he graciously conceded it to Franklin, 36 years his senior.[79] Franklin, however, appointed Goddard as Surveyor of the Posts, issued him a signed pass, and directed him to investigate and inspect the various post offices and mail routes as he saw fit.[84][85] The newly established postal system became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.[86]\n\n\n\n### Decades in London[edit]\n\n\nFrom the mid-1750s to the mid-1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Political work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pennsylvania colonial currency printed by Franklin and David Hall in 1764\n![](image)Franklin in London in 1767, wearing a blue suit with elaborate gold braid and buttons, a far cry from the simple dress he affected at the French court in later years, depicted in a portrait by David Martin that is now on display in the White House\nIn 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the Penn family, the proprietors of the colony. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in Whitehall led to the failure of this mission.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with William Penn's heirs, who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the \"anti-proprietary party\" in the struggle against the Penn family and was elected Speaker of the Pennsylvania House in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched him to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.[87]\n\n\nIn London, Franklin opposed the 1765 Stamp Act. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal.[88] With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. Georgia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.[87]\n\n\nDuring his lengthy missions to London between 1757 and 1775, Franklin lodged in a house on Craven Street, just off the Strand in central London.[89] During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular, her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. The house is now a museum known as the Benjamin Franklin House. Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a gentleman's club (which he called \"the honest Whigs\"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as Richard Price, the minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church who ignited the Revolution controversy, and Andrew Kippis.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Scientific work[edit]\n\n\nIn 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce (now the Royal Society of Arts), which had been founded in 1754. After his return to the United States in 1775, he became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The Royal Society of Arts instituted a Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.[91]\n\n\nThe study of natural philosophy (referred today as science in general) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham.[92] In 1759, the University of St Andrews awarded him an honorary doctorate in recognition of his accomplishments.[93] In October 1759, he was granted Freedom of the Borough of St Andrews.[94] He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University in 1762. Because of these honors, he was often addressed as \"Dr. Franklin\".[1]\n\n\nWhile living in London in 1768, he developed a phonetic alphabet in *A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling*. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters he regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. This alphabet never caught on, and he eventually lost interest.[95]\n\n\n\n### Travels around Europe[edit]\n\n\nFranklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with Joseph Priestley at Leeds, Thomas Percival at Manchester and Erasmus Darwin at Lichfield.[96] In Scotland, he spent five days with Lord Kames near Stirling and stayed for three weeks with David Hume in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited Edinburgh with his son and later reported that he considered his six weeks in Scotland \"six weeks of the densest happiness I have met with in any part of my life\".[97]\n\n\nIn Ireland, he stayed with Lord Hillsborough. Franklin noted of him that \"all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides.\"[98] In Dublin, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.[96] While touring Ireland, he was deeply moved by the level of poverty he witnessed. The economy of the Kingdom of Ireland was affected by the same trade regulations and laws that governed the Thirteen Colonies. He feared that the American colonies could eventually come to the same level of poverty if the regulations and laws continued to apply to them.[99]\n\n\nFranklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist Otto von Guericke for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first treaty of friendship between Prussia and America in 1785.[100] In September 1767, he visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to King Louis XV.[9]\n\n\n\n### Defending the American cause[edit]\n\n\nOne line of argument in Parliament was that Americans should pay a share of the costs of the French and Indian War and therefore taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France\u2014as many as Britain itself sent\u2014and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the French and Indian War alone.[101][102]\n\n\nIn 1772, Franklin obtained private letters of Thomas Hutchinson and Andrew Oliver, governor and lieutenant governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, proving that they had encouraged the Crown to crack down on Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America, where they escalated tensions. The letters were finally leaked to the public in the *Boston Gazette* in mid-June 1773,[103] causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.[104] The British began to regard him as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by Solicitor-General Alexander Wedderburn, before the Privy Council on January 29, 1774. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1775, and abandoned his accommodationist stance.[105]\n\n\nIn 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: \"Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One\", and \"An Edict by the King of Prussia\".[106]\n\n\n\n### Agent for British and Hellfire Club membership[edit]\n\n\nFranklin is known to have occasionally attended the Hellfire Club's meetings during 1758 as a non-member during his time in England. However, some authors and historians would argue he was in fact a British spy. As there are no records left (having been burned in 1774[107]), many of these members are just assumed or linked by letters sent to each other.[108] One early proponent that Franklin was a member of the Hellfire Club and a double agent is the historian Donald McCormick,[109] who has a history of making controversial claims.[110]\n\n\n\n### Coming of revolution[edit]\n\n\nIn 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania from England for the first time, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as Pontiac's Rebellion. The Paxton Boys, a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from American Indian raids, murdered a group of peaceful Susquehannock Indians and marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local militia to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the racial prejudice of the Paxton Boys. \"If an *Indian* injures me\", he asked, \"does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all *Indians*?\"[111]\n\n\nHe provided an early response to British surveillance through his own network of counter-surveillance and manipulation. \"He waged a public relations campaign, secured secret aid, played a role in privateering expeditions, and churned out effective and inflammatory propaganda.\"[112]\n\n\n\n### Declaration of Independence[edit]\n\n\n![About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. The tallest of the five is laying a document on a table.](image)John Trumbull's portrait of the Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia[113]\nBy the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the American Revolution had begun at the Battles of Lexington and Concord the previous month, on April 19, 1775. The New England militia had forced the main British army to remain inside Boston.[*citation needed*] The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the Second Continental Congress.[*citation needed*] In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the committee,[*citation needed*] he made several \"small but important\" changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson.[114]\n\n\nAt the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by John Hancock that they must all hang together, saying, \"Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.\"[115]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Ambassador to France (1776\u20131785)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Franklin, in his fur hat, charmed the French with what they perceived as his rustic New World genius.[Note 3]\n![](image)While in France, Franklin designed and commissioned Augustin Dupr\u00e9 to engrave the medallion Libertas Americana, which was minted in Paris in 1783.\nOn October 26, 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as commissioner for the United States.[116] He took with him as secretary his 16-year-old grandson, William Temple Franklin. They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy, donated by Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and signing the 1783 Treaty of Paris.[117]\n\n\nAmong his associates in France was Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau\u2014a French Revolutionary writer, orator and statesman who in 1791 was elected president of the National Assembly.[118] In July 1784, Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials that the Frenchman used in his first signed work: *Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus*.[119] The publication was critical of the Society of the Cincinnati, established in the United States. Franklin and Mirabeau thought of it as a \"noble order\", inconsistent with the egalitarian ideals of the new republic.[120]\n\n\nDuring his stay in France, he was active as a Freemason, serving as venerable master of the lodge Les Neuf S\u0153urs from 1779 until 1781. In 1784, when Franz Mesmer began to publicize his theory of \"animal magnetism\" which was considered offensive by many, Louis XVI appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the physician Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, and Franklin.[121] In doing so, the committee concluded, through blind trials that mesmerism only seemed to work when the subjects expected it, which discredited mesmerism and became the first major demonstration of the placebo effect, which was described at that time as \"imagination\".[122] In 1781, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[123]\n\n\nFranklin's advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that resulted in Louis XVI's signing of the Edict of Versailles in November 1787. This edict effectively nullified the Edict of Fontainebleau, which had denied non-Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faith.[124]\n\n\nFranklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country.[125] He negotiated a treaty that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783, in Paris, he witnessed the world's first hydrogen balloon flight.[126] *Le Globe*, created by professor Jacques Charles and Les Fr\u00e8res Robert, was watched by a vast crowd as it rose from the Champ de Mars (now the site of the Eiffel Tower).[127] Franklin became so enthusiastic that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon.[128] On December 1, 1783, Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honored guests it took off from the Jardin des Tuileries, piloted by Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert.[126][129]\n\n\n\n### Return to America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Franklin's return to Philadelphia, 1785*, a portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![](image)George Washington witnesses Gouverneur Morris sign the Constitution with Franklin seen behind Morris, in John Henry Hintermeister's 1925 portrait, *Foundation of the American Government*[130]\nWhen he returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position second only to that of George Washington as the champion of American independence. He returned from France with an unexplained shortage of 100,000 pounds in Congressional funds. In response to a question from a member of Congress about this, Franklin, quoting the Bible, quipped, \"Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out his master's grain.\" The missing funds were never again mentioned in Congress.[131] \nLe Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by Joseph Duplessis, which now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. After his return, Franklin became an abolitionist and freed his two slaves. He eventually became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.[99]\n\n\n\n#### President of Pennsylvania and Delegate to the Constitutional convention[edit]\n\n\nSpecial balloting conducted October 18, 1785, unanimously elected him the sixth president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, replacing John Dickinson. The office was practically that of the governor. He held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election, he was re-elected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. In that capacity, he served as host to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia.[132]\n\n\nHe also served as a delegate to the Convention. It was primarily an honorary position and he seldom engaged in debate.\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Franklin's gravesite at Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia\nFranklin suffered from obesity throughout his middle age and elder years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly gout, which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFranklin died from pleuritic attack[133] at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790.[134] He was aged 84 at the time of his death. His last words were reportedly, \"a dying man can do nothing easy\", to his daughter after she suggested that he change position in bed and lie on his side so he could breathe more easily.[135][136] Franklin's death is described in the book *The Life of Benjamin Franklin*, quoting from the account of John Paul Jones:\n\n\n\n\n> ...\u00a0when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.[137]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nApproximately 20,000 people attended Franklin's funeral after which he was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.[138][139] Upon learning of his death, the Constitutional Assembly in Revolutionary France entered into a state of mourning for a period of three days, and memorial services were conducted in honor of Franklin throughout the country.[140]\n\n\nIn 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:\n\n\n\n\n> The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new & more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.[141]\n> \n> \n\n\nFranklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads \"Benjamin and Deborah Franklin\".[142]\n\n\n\n## Inventions and scientific inquiries[edit]\n\n\nFranklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the lightning rod, Franklin stove, bifocal glasses and the flexible urinary catheter. He never patented his inventions; in his autobiography he wrote, \"...\u00a0as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### Electricity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky*, a c.\u20091816 portrait by Benjamin West now on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art\nFranklin started exploring the phenomenon of electricity in the 1740s, after he met the itinerant lecturer Archibald Spencer, who used static electricity in his demonstrations.[144] He proposed that \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\" electricity were not different types of \"electrical fluid\" (as electricity was called then), but the same \"fluid\" under different pressures. (The same proposal was made independently that same year by William Watson.) He was the first to label them as positive and negative respectively,[145][146] and he was the first to discover the principle of conservation of charge.[147] In 1748, he constructed a multiple plate capacitor, that he called an \"electrical battery\" (not a true battery like Volta's pile) by placing eleven panes of glass sandwiched between lead plates, suspended with silk cords and connected by wires.[148]\n\n\nIn pursuit of more pragmatic uses for electricity, remarking in spring 1749 that he felt \"chagrin'd a little\" that his experiments had heretofore resulted in \"Nothing in this Way of Use to Mankind\", he planned a practical demonstration. He proposed a dinner party where a turkey was to be killed via electric shock and roasted on an electrical spit.[149] After having prepared several turkeys this way, he noted that \"the birds kill'd in this manner eat uncommonly tender.\"[150] Franklin recounted that in the process of one of these experiments, he was shocked by a pair of Leyden jars, resulting in numbness in his arms that persisted for one evening, noting \"I am Ashamed to have been Guilty of so Notorious a Blunder.\"[151]\n\n\nFranklin briefly investigated electrotherapy, including the use of the electric bath. This work led to the field becoming widely known.[152] In recognition of his work with electricity, he received the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1753, and in 1756, he became one of the few 18th-century Americans elected a fellow of the Society. The CGS unit of electric charge has been named after him: one *franklin* (Fr) is equal to one statcoulomb.\n\n\nFranklin advised Harvard University in its acquisition of new electrical laboratory apparatus after the complete loss of its original collection, in a fire that destroyed the original Harvard Hall in 1764. The collection he assembled later became part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, now on public display in its Science Center.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Kite experiment and lightning rod[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Franklin and Electricity*, a vignette engraved by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, c.\u20091860\nFranklin published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by flying a kite in a storm. On May 10, 1752, Thomas-Fran\u00e7ois Dalibard of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a 40-foot-tall (12\u00a0m) iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15, 1752, Franklin may possibly have conducted his well-known kite experiment in Philadelphia, successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. He described the experiment in his newspaper, *The Pennsylvania Gazette*, on October 19, 1752,[154][155] without mentioning that he himself had performed it.[156] This account was read to the Royal Society on December 21 and printed as such in the *Philosophical Transactions*.[157] Joseph Priestley published an account with additional details in his 1767 *History and Present Status of Electricity*. Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of electric shock.[158] Others, such as Georg Wilhelm Richmann in Russia, were indeed electrocuted in performing lightning experiments during the months immediately following his experiment.[159]\n\n\nIn his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of electrical ground. He did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous.[160] Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical.[161] On October 19, 1752, in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, he wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or Leyden jar, may be charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening [*sic*] completely demonstrated.[161]\n> \n> \n\n\nFranklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the lightning rod. He said that conductors with a sharp[162] rather than a smooth point could discharge silently and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching \"upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;\u00a0... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!\" Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.[163]\n\n\n\n### Population studies[edit]\n\n\nFranklin had a major influence on the emerging science of demography or population studies.[164] In the 1730s and 1740s, he began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rate on Earth.[165] Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies, he emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America's population was doubling every 20 years and would surpass that of England in a century.[166] In 1751, he drafted *Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.* Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston and was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced the economist Adam Smith and later the demographer Thomas Malthus, who credited Franklin for discovering a rule of population growth.[167] Franklin's predictions how British mercantilism was unsustainable alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.[168]\n\n\nKammen (1990) and Drake (2011) say Franklin's *Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind* (1755) stands alongside Ezra Stiles' \"Discourse on Christian Union\" (1760) as the leading works of 18th-century Anglo-American demography; Drake credits Franklin's \"wide readership and prophetic insight\".[169][170] Franklin was also a pioneer in the study of slave demography, as shown in his 1755 essay.[171] In his capacity as a farmer, he wrote at least one critique about the negative consequences of price controls, trade restrictions, and subsidy of the poor. This is succinctly preserved in his letter to the *London Chronicle* published November 29, 1766, titled \"On the Price of Corn, and Management of the poor\".[172]\n\n\n\n### Oceanography[edit]\n\n\nAs deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in North Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs. British packet ships carrying mail had taken several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach Newport, Rhode Island. The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from Falmouth in Cornwall.[173] Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a Nantucket whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of 3 miles per hour (5\u00a0km/h). Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the Gulf Stream, by which it is still known today.[174]\n\n\nFranklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British original edition of the chart had been so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a Woods Hole oceanographer and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris in 1980.[175][176] This find received front-page coverage in *The New York Times*.[177] It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time.[178][179] In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer Matthew Fontaine Maury noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:\n\n\n\n\n> Though it was Dr. Franklin and Captain Tim Folger, who first turned the Gulf Stream to nautical account, the discovery that there was a Gulf Stream cannot be said to belong to either of them, for its existence was known to Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, and to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, in the 16th century.[180]\n> \n> \n\nAn aging Franklin accumulated all his oceanographic findings in *Maritime Observations*, published by the Philosophical Society's *transactions* in 1786.[181] It contained ideas for sea anchors, catamaran hulls, watertight compartments, shipboard lightning rods and a soup bowl designed to stay stable in stormy weather.\n\n\n### Theories and experiments[edit]\n\n\nFranklin was, along with his contemporary Leonhard Euler, the only major scientist who supported Christiaan Huygens's wave theory of light, which was basically ignored by the rest of the scientific community. In the 18th century, Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory was held to be true; it took Thomas Young's well-known slit experiment in 1803 to persuade most scientists to believe Huygens's theory.[182]\n\n\nOn October 21, 1743, according to the popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a lunar eclipse. He was said to have noted that the prevailing winds were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, he learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced meteorology.[183] After the Icelandic volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783, and the subsequent harsh European winter of 1784, Franklin made observations on the causal nature of these two seemingly separate events. He wrote about them in a lecture series.[184]\n\n\nThough Franklin is famously associated with kites from his lightning experiments, he has also been noted by many for using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways.[185] George Pocock in the book *A Treatise on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails*[186] noted being inspired by Benjamin Franklin's traction of his body by kite power across a waterway.\n\n\nFranklin noted a principle of refrigeration by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly, he conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in Cambridge, England, he and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer with ether and using bellows to evaporate the ether.[187] With each subsequent evaporation, the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching 7\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C). Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at 65\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C). In his letter *Cooling by Evaporation*, Franklin noted that, \"One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day.\"[188]\n\n\nAccording to Michael Faraday, Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning, although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin.[189] However, as reported in 1836 by Franklin's great-grandson Alexander Dallas Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin wrote, \"...\u00a0A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct\u00a0...\" and again, \"...\u00a0And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice.\"[190]\n\n\nWhile traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship was diminished when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects on a large pond in Clapham Common, London. \"I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water\u00a0... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square.\" He later used the trick to \"calm the waters\" by carrying \"a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane\".[191]\n\n\n\n### Decision-making[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration that appears in Franklin's paper, \"Water-spouts and Whirlwinds\"\nIn a 1772 letter to Joseph Priestley, Franklin laid out the earliest known description of the Pro & Con list,[192] a common decision-making technique, now sometimes called a decisional balance sheet:\n\n\n\n\n> ...\u00a0my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one *Pro*, and over the other *Con*. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason *pro* equal to some two Reasons *con*, I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons *con* equal to some three Reasons *pro*, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.[192]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Views on religion and morality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bust of Franklin built by Jean-Antoine Houdon in 1778\n![](image)*Voltaire blessing Franklin's grandson, in the name of God and Liberty*, an 1890 portrait by Pedro Am\u00e9rico\n![](image)A statue of Franklin by Hiram Powers\n![](image)Richard Price, the radical minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church, holding a letter from Franklin\nLike the other advocates of republicanism, Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life, he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in *Poor Richard's* aphorisms. He felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself.[193] When he met Voltaire in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, \"God and Liberty\", and added, \"this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin.\"[194]\n\n\nFranklin's parents were both pious Puritans.[195] The family attended the Old South Church, the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706.[196] Franklin's father, a poor chandler, owned a copy of a book, *Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good*, by the Puritan preacher and family friend Cotton Mather, which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life. \"If I have been\", Franklin wrote to Cotton Mather's son seventy years later, \"a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book\".[197] His first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.[198]\n\n\nFranklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728.[199] He no longer accepted the key Puritan ideas regarding salvation, the divinity of Jesus, or indeed much religious dogma. He classified himself as a deist in his 1771 autobiography,[200] although he still considered himself a Christian.[201] He retained a strong faith in a God as the wellspring of morality and goodness in man, and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence.[202]\n\n\nAt a critical impasse during the Constitutional Convention in June 1787, he attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:\n\n\n\n\n> ...\u00a0In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.\u00a0... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth\u2014that God governs in the affairs of men....I therefore beg leave to move\u2014that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.[203]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe motion gained almost no support and was never brought to a vote.[204]\n\n\nFranklin was an enthusiastic admirer of the evangelical minister George Whitefield during the First Great Awakening. He did not himself subscribe to Whitefield's theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. He published all of Whitefield's sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.[205]\n\n\nWhen he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:\n\n\n\n\n> ...\u00a0Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.[206][207]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFranklin retained a lifelong commitment to the non-religious Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a \"passion for virtue\".[208] These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit.[209] Thomas Kidd states, \"As an adult, Franklin touted ethical responsibility, industriousness, and benevolence, even as he jettisoned Christian orthodoxy.\"[210]\n\n\nThe classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract ideal of republican government based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class.[211] \"Puritanism\u00a0... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification\"[212] by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved.[212] Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFranklin's commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on \"inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities\".[213] These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of his quintessentially American characteristics and helped shape the character of the nation. Max Weber considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the Protestant ethic, which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of capitalism.[214]\n\n\nOne of his notable characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in his autobiography, \"new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused.\"[206] \"He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism.\"[215] The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, \"claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'\"[216] Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected \"a large, new hall, that\u00a0... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief.\"[217] Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and civic virtue made him the \"prophet of tolerance\".[215] He composed \"A Parable Against Persecution\", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance.[218] While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of British Unitarianism, attending the inaugural session of the Essex Street Chapel, at which Theophilus Lindsey drew together the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until the 1813 Act.[219]\n\n\nAlthough his parents had intended for him a career in the church,[16] Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in deism, that God's truths can be found entirely through nature and reason,[220] declaring, \"I soon became a thorough Deist.\"[221] He rejected Christian dogma in a 1725 pamphlet *A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain*,[222] which he later saw as an embarrassment,[223] while simultaneously asserting that God is \"all wise, all good, all powerful.\"[223] He defended his rejection of religious dogma with these words: \"I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects; and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious, it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous, which I hope is the case with me.\" After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to deism, Franklin decided that deism was true but it was not as useful in promoting personal morality as were the controls imposed by organized religion.[224] Ralph Frasca contends that in his later life he can be considered a non-denominational Christian, although he did not believe Christ was divine.[225]\n\n\nIn a major scholarly study of his religion, Thomas Kidd argues that Franklin believed that true religiosity was a matter of personal morality and civic virtue. Kidd says Franklin maintained his lifelong resistance to orthodox Christianity while arriving finally at a \"doctrineless, moralized Christianity.\"[226] According to David Morgan,[227] Franklin was a proponent of \"generic religion.\" He prayed to \"Powerful Goodness\" and referred to God as \"the infinite\". John Adams noted that he was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: \"The Catholics thought him almost a Catholic. The Church of England claimed him as one of them. The Presbyterians thought him half a Presbyterian, and the Friends believed him a wet Quaker.\" Adams himself decided that Franklin best fit among the \"Atheists, Deists, and Libertines.\"[228] Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, \"he was a true champion of generic religion\". In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin states that he believes religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, \"When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.\"[229]\n\n\nIn 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to Ezra Stiles, president of Yale University, who had asked him his views on religion:\n\n\n\n\n> As to Jesus of Nazareth, my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present Dissenters in England, some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble. I see no harm, however, in its being believed, if that belief has the good consequence, as it probably has, of making his doctrines more respected and better observed; especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any particular marks of his displeasure.[20]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams to design the Great Seal of the United States. Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: \"Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God\" and a scene from the Book of Exodus, with Moses, the Israelites, the pillar of fire, and George III depicted as pharaoh. The design that was produced was not acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.[230][231]\n\n\nFranklin strongly supported the right to freedom of speech:\n\n\n\n\n> In those wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own, he can scarce call anything his own. Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech\u00a0...\n> Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech, which is the right of every man\u00a0...\n> \n> \u2014\u200aSilence Dogood no. 8, 1722[232]\n> \n\n\n### Thirteen Virtues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bust of Franklin in the Archives Department at Columbia University in New York City\nFranklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His autobiography lists his 13 virtues as:[233]\n\n\n\n1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\"\n2. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\"\n3. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n4. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n5. Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.\n6. Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n7. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\n8. Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\n9. Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\n10. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.\n11. Tranquility. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n12. Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.\n13. Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\n\nFranklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he worked on one and only one each week \"leaving all others to their ordinary chance\". While he did not adhere completely to the enumerated virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man, contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point and wrote, \"I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.\"[234]\n\n\n\n### Slavery[edit]\n\n\nFranklin owned as many as seven slaves, including two men who worked in his household and his shop.[235][236] He posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. However, he later became an outspoken critic of slavery. In 1758, he advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia.[237] He took two slaves to England with him, Peter and King. King escaped with a woman to live in the outskirts of London,[238] and by 1758 he was working for a household in Suffolk.[239] After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became notably more abolitionist in nature, attacking American slavery. In the wake of *Somerset v Stewart*, he voiced frustration at British abolitionists:\n\n\n\n\n> O Pharisaical Britain! to pride thyself in setting free a single Slave that happens to land on thy coasts, while thy Merchants in all thy ports are encouraged by thy laws to continue a commerce whereby so many hundreds of thousands are dragged into a slavery that can scarce be said to end with their lives, since it is entailed on their posterity![240][241]\n> \n> \n\n\nFranklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the 1787 Constitutional Convention.[242]\n\n\nAt the time of the American founding, there were about half a million slaves in the United States, mostly in the five southernmost states, where they made up 40% of the population. Many of the leading American founders\u00a0\u2013 most notably Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and James Madison\u00a0\u2013 owned slaves, but many others did not. Benjamin Franklin thought that slavery was \"an atrocious debasement of human nature\" and \"a source of serious evils\". He and Benjamin Rush founded the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery in 1774.[243] In 1790, Quakers from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress. Their argument against slavery was backed by the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society.[244]\n\n\nIn his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the abolition of slavery and of the integration of African Americans into American society. These writings included:\n\n\n\n* *An Address to the Public* (1789)\n* *A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks* (1789)\n* *Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade* (1790)[245]\n\n\n### Vegetarianism[edit]\n\n\nFranklin became a vegetarian when he was a teenager apprenticing at a print shop, after coming upon a book by the early vegetarian advocate Thomas Tryon.[246] In addition, he would have also been familiar with the moral arguments espoused by prominent vegetarian Quakers in the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, including Benjamin Lay and John Woolman. His reasons for vegetarianism were based on health, ethics, and economy:\n\n\n\n\n> When about 16 years of age, I happen'd to meet with a book written by one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it ... [By not eating meat] I presently found that I could save half what [my brother] paid me. This was an additional fund for buying books: but I had another advantage in it ... I made the greater progress from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eating and drinking.[247]\n> \n> \n\n\nFranklin also declared the consumption of meat to be \"unprovoked murder\".[248] Despite his convictions, he began to eat fish after being tempted by fried cod on a boat sailing from Boston, justifying the eating of animals by observing that the fish's stomach contained other fish. Nonetheless, he recognized the faulty ethics in this argument[249] and would continue to be a vegetarian on and off. He was \"excited\" by tofu, which he learned of from the writings of a Spanish missionary to South East Asia, Domingo Fern\u00e1ndez Navarrete. Franklin sent a sample of soybeans to prominent American botanist John Bartram and had previously written to British diplomat and Chinese trade expert James Flint inquiring as to how tofu was made,[250] with their correspondence believed to be the first documented use of the word \"tofu\" in the English language.[251]\n\n\nFranklin's \"Second Reply to *Vindex Patriae*\", a 1766 letter advocating self-sufficiency and less dependence on England, lists various examples of the bounty of American agricultural products, and does not mention meat.[250] Detailing new American customs, he wrote that, \"[t]hey resolved last spring to eat no more lamb; and not a joint of lamb has since been seen on any of their tables ... the sweet little creatures are all alive to this day, with the prettiest fleeces on their backs imaginable.\"[252]\n\n\n\n### View on inoculation[edit]\n\n\nThe concept of preventing smallpox by variolation was introduced to colonial America by an African slave named Onesimus via his owner Cotton Mather in the early eighteenth century, but the procedure was not immediately accepted. James Franklin's newspaper carried articles in 1721[253] that vigorously denounced the concept.[254]\n\n\nHowever, by 1736 Benjamin Franklin, by then a prominent Boston citizen, was known as a supporter of the procedure. Therefore, when four-year-old \"Franky\" died of smallpox, opponents of the procedure circulated rumors that the child had been inoculated, and that this was the cause of his subsequent death. When Franklin became aware of this gossip, he placed a notice in the *Pennsylvania Gazette*, stating: \"I do hereby sincerely declare, that he was not inoculated, but receiv'd the Distemper in the common Way of Infection ... I intended to have my Child inoculated.\". The child had a bad case of flux diarrhea, and his parents had waited for him to get well before having him inoculated. Franklin wrote in his *Autobiography*: \"In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.\"[255]\n\n\n\n## Interests and activities[edit]\n\n\n### Musical endeavors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)While in London, Franklin developed an improved version of the glass harmonica\nFranklin is known to have played the violin, the harp, and the guitar. He also composed music, notably a string quartet in early classical style.[256] While he was in London, he developed a much-improved version of the glass harmonica, in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around. He worked with the London glassblower Charles James to create it, and instruments based on his mechanical version soon found their way to other parts of Europe.[257] Joseph Haydn, a fan of Franklin's enlightened ideas, had a glass harmonica in his instrument collection.[258] Mozart composed for Franklin's glass harmonica,[259] as did Beethoven.[260][261] Gaetano Donizetti used the instrument in the accompaniment to Amelia's aria \"Par che mi dica ancora\" in the tragic opera *Il castello di Kenilworth* (1821),[262] as did Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns in his 1886 *The Carnival of the Animals*.[263] Richard Strauss calls for the glass harmonica in his 1917 *Die Frau ohne Schatten*,[259] and numerous other composers used Franklin's instrument as well.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Chess[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, named in Franklin's honor\nFranklin was an avid chess player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies.[264] His essay on \"The Morals of Chess\" in *Columbian Magazine* in December 1786 is the second known writing on chess in America.[264] This essay in praise of chess and prescribing a code of behavior for the game has been widely reprinted and translated.[265][266][267][268] He and a friend used chess as a means of learning the Italian language, which both were studying; the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task, such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart, to be performed by the loser before their next meeting.[269]\n\n\nFranklin was able to play chess more frequently against stronger opposition during his many years as a civil servant and diplomat in England, where the game was far better established than in America. He was able to improve his playing standard by facing more experienced players during this period. He regularly attended Old Slaughter's Coffee House in London for chess and socializing, making many important personal contacts. While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence, which France's strongest players made their regular meeting place. No records of his games have survived, so it is not possible to ascertain his playing strength in modern terms.[270]\n\n\nFranklin was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1999.[264] The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, the second oldest chess club in the U.S., is named in his honor.[271]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Designations |\n| --- |\n| Pennsylvania Historical Marker\n |\n| Official name | Benjamin Franklin (1706\u20131790) |\n| Type | City |\n| Criteria | Government & Politics, Government & Politics 18th Century, Invention, Science & Medicine, Professions & Vocations, Publishing & Journalism, Writers |\n| Designated | June 30, 1990[272] |\n| Location | Chestnut St. between 3rd & 4th Sts., at Nat'l.

The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour, who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly parody of Franklin's *Poor Richard's Almanack* called *Fortunate Richard*. The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 *livres*, to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects.[274] Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000\u00a0pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia.\n\n\nBy 1990, more than $2,000,000 (~$4.12\u00a0million in 2023) had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a trade school that became the Franklin Institute of Boston, and the entire fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.[275][276]\n\n\nIn 1787, a group of prominent ministers in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, proposed the foundation of a new college named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated \u00a3200 towards the development of Franklin College (now called Franklin & Marshall College).[277]\n\n\n\n### Likeness and image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A life-size bronze statue of Franklin (seated with cane) in the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia\nAs the only person to have signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Treaty of Alliance with France in 1778, Treaty of Paris in 1783, and U.S. Constitution in 1787, Franklin is considered one of the leading Founding Fathers of the United States. His pervasive influence in the early history of the nation has led to his being jocularly called \"the only president of the United States who was never president of the United States\".[278]\n\n\nFranklin's likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American $100 bills. From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the half-dollar.[279] He has appeared on a $50 bill and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918.[280] Franklin also appears on the $1,000 Series EE savings bond.[281]\n\n\nOn April 12, 1976, as part of a bicentennial celebration, Congress dedicated a 20-foot (6\u00a0m) tall marble statue in Philadelphia's Franklin Institute as the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller presided over the dedication ceremony.[282] Many of Franklin's personal possessions are on display at the institute. In London, his house at 36 Craven Street, which is the only surviving former residence of Franklin, was first marked with a blue plaque and has since been opened to the public as the Benjamin Franklin House.[283] In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. A total of 15 bodies have been recovered.[284] The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by William Hewson, who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.[285]\n\n\nHe has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first postmaster general of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. postage more than any other notable American save that of George Washington.[286] He appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923, the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the Washington\u2013Franklin Issues, in which Washington and Franklin were depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in U.S. postal history. However, he only appears on a few commemorative stamps. Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of U.S. postage.[286]\n\n\n\n![](image)Franklin has appeared on the United States $100 dollar bill since 1914.\n\n![](image)\nIssue of 1861\n![](image)\nIssue of 1895\n![](image)\nIssue of 1918\nExamples of Franklin on U.

He was also the founder of Washington College in Chestertown Maryland, and St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of Arms of William Smith\n![](image)William Smith's residence as it appeared circa 1919\n![](image)Rebecca Moore Smith, portrait by Benjamin West\nSmith was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, to Thomas and Elizabeth (Duncan) Smith. He attended the University of Aberdeen, later claiming a master's from the institution. He also held the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Aberdeen, the University of Oxford, and Trinity College, Dublin. In 1753, Smith wrote a pamphlet outlining his thoughts about education.[2] The book fell into the hands of Benjamin Franklin and Richard Peters; as a result they asked Smith to come to Philadelphia and teach at the newly established college there (now the University of Pennsylvania).[3]\n\n\nIn 1755 Smith became the first provost (the equivalent of the modern post of university president) of the school. He held the post until 1779. Smith was an Anglican priest and together with William Moore, Smith was briefly jailed in 1758 for his criticism of the military policy in the Quaker-run colony. Indeed, during the French and Indian War, Smith published two anti-Quaker pamphlets that advocated the disenfranchisement of all Quakers, who were the political elite in Pennsylvania. However, their pacifist beliefs made it difficult for the Quakers in government to provide funds for defense, and as a result anti-Quaker sentiment ran high, especially in the backcountry which suffered from frequent raids from Indians allied with the French. Smith's second pamphlet, *A Brief View of the Conduct of Pennsylvania, For the Year 1755* (1756), actually went so far as to suggest that while one way of \"ridding our Assembly of Quakers\" would be to require an oath, \"another way of getting rid of them\" would be \"by cutting their Throats.\"[4] Smith's virulent attacks on Quakers alienated him from Franklin, who was closely allied with the Pennsylvania Assembly.\n\n\nSmith courted and married Moore's daughter, Rebecca, and had seven children. Their grandson William Rudolph Smith became a politician who served in both the Pennsylvania and Wisconsin state legislatures.[5]\n\n\nSmith advocated for the Church of England to appoint a bishop in America, a highly controversial proposal insofar as many Americans feared any ecclesiastical institution that might compel compliance with the force of royal authority. Smith received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from the University of Oxford and the University of Aberdeen in 1759 and from Trinity College, Dublin in 1763. In 1768 he became a member of the American Philosophical Society.\n\n\nSmith was also the founding editor of *The American Magazine, or Monthly Chronicle for the British Colonies*, the first publication of its kind, which appeared from October 1757 until October 1758, when publication ceased owing to Smith's incarceration due to the previously mentioned libel action initiated by the Pennsylvania Assembly.\n\n\nSmith's best known work as an author is \"Bouquet's Expedition Against the Ohio Indians in 1764\" (1765), an account of the last campaign in Pontiac's War, led by Colonel Henry Bouquet.\n\n\nWhen the American Revolution broke out, Smith was in a bind. As an Anglican priest, he was viewed as a Loyalist, but his sentiments were far more sympathetic towards the Patriots than otherwise, even to the point of founding a college named for George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Patriot Continental Army, in the midst of war. He was appointed to serve on the Philadelphia Committee of Correspondence in 1774, along with such notables as John Dickinson, Samuel Miles, and Joseph Reed. Forced to leave Philadelphia, Smith moved to Maryland where helped found and become the first president of Washington College, an institution that he intended to be the premiere academic institution of the region; it received almost exclusive patronage from the first President of the United States, George Washington.\n\n\nAfter the war, he returned to Philadelphia, where he briefly regained his post at Penn. His final project was the development of land in the western region of the state. Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, was founded by Rev. Smith, and his sons were the first leaders of its government.\n\n\n\n## Efforts for American Anglicanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDr. Smith as a young man\n\nSelina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, was a patron of William Smith's and had some unfortunate personal tragedies which motivated her interest in the spread of religion. Incidentally, Smith named his real estate venture *Huntingdon* in her honor. This was along the Juniata River, in central Pennsylvania. Lady Huntingdon was persuaded that the Church of England needed to return to the path of righteousness. The Wesleys (John Wesley, Charles Wesley) and George Whitefield whom she supported, in addition to Smith's interests, found it easier to work towards righteousness in the \"low\" church or what became called Methodism or the \"Methodist Movement.\"\n\n\nTo further show the problems that the colonials had with the Church of England, William Smith, seemed to be right in the middle of things. The May 1, 1760 first free and voluntary Convention of the American (Anglican) Priesthood met at Christ Church, Philadelphia, Dr. Smith presiding. The attendees wanted and needed an American Episcopate (bishop). Smith worked towards that goal.\n\n\nThere was a very practical element here. To obtain more priests for work in the colonies, ordination of priests had to be done by a bishop. The bishop was in England. The trip to and from England in those days was risky. Many prospective priests and those recently ordained didn't survive the trip. Thus, there was a supply problem with priests in the colonies. The Bishop of London had superintendency of the colonies but was not going to do anything that would incur Royal disfavor.\n\n\nSmith was having trouble getting the Privy Council in England to pay attention to his pleas for the King to approve the consecration of a bishop that would reside in the American colonies. Archbishop of Canterbury Secker also sensed that the time was not yet right. The King was the Head of the Church of England, the same King the Americans revolted against. A modern look back at this period indicates that King George III's \"mental\" illness of an inherited biochemical etiology (porphyria) was rather unpredictable and caused great havoc in the order of things.\n\n\nNo approval ever came for an American bishop before the Revolution. Afterwards, the American priests turned to the Scottish bishops to consecrate Rev. Samuel Seabury, the first American bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church. This was always viewed as \"almost proper.\" Thus, perfection in this matter had to wait until things settled down in the post-Revolutionary era.\n\n\nWith all the political activity by Smith working for an American bishop on both sides of the Atlantic, the question obviously was why didn't Smith become elevated to that station? The reports handed down were that Rev. Dr. Smith was \"too fond of the grape\" to be worthy of such consecration.[6]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t* Birth date noted at (Smith 1880a, p.\u00a018)\n\t* Death described at (Smith 1880b, p.\u00a0446)\n2. **^** \"Archived copy\".

He also was a noted mathematician.\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nEwing and his twin brother, James, were born on June 22, 1732, in Cecil County, Province of Maryland. Their parents, Nathaniel Ewing and Rachel Porter, had emigrated to America several years earlier from Northern Ireland. Ewing married Hannah Sergeant in 1758, and they had 12 children.\n\n\nEwing was educated at a Pennsylvania prep school run by the Rev. Francis Alison, a respected classical scholar, and at the College of New Jersey (today's Princeton University), where he graduated with the class of 1754.[1]\n\n\nAfter working as a tutor at Alison's school, Ewing joined the faculty at the College of Philadelphia (today's University of Pennsylvania) in 1758 as a professor of ethics. He became a professor of natural philosophy in 1762.[2]\n\n\n\n## Clergy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1759, Ewing also became a pastor at the First Presbyterian Church, where Alison also had served as a pastor.[3] Ewing's sermons were popular with the general churchgoers and educated elites, according to a Presbyterian historian.[4] A selection of his sermons was published in 1812.[5]\n\n\nEwing's senior role in the Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia earned him a position on the University of Pennsylvania's board of trustees from 1779 to 1802. He became the university's provost in 1780.[6]\n\n\nEwing's scientific pursuits included observing the 1769 Transit of Venus from an observatory at the State House Yard and assisting with the routing of the boundary line for the state of Delaware and the path for the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike. He joined the American Philosophical Society in 1768 and served as the treasurer of the Corporation for the Relief of Poor and Distressed Presbyterian Ministers, one of the earliest American life insurance companies.[7]\n\n\nEwing traveled to Britain in 1773 to raise money for the Newark Academy in Delaware. During the trip, he was awarded an honorary doctor of divinity from the University of Edinburgh and met with a number of prominent Britons, including Lord North, who was the prime minister, and Dr. Samuel Johnson, the English writer.[8]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Penn Biographies: John Ewing (1732-1802),\" University of Pennsylvania website, undated.\n2. **^** \"Penn Biographies: John Ewing (1732-1802),\" University of Pennsylvania website, undated.\n3. **^** \"Old Pine Street Presbyterian Church,\" Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia website, undated.\n4. **^** Samuel Miller, \"John Ewing,\" This Day in Presbyterian History website, undated.\n5. **^** \"Sermons by the Rev.

In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.
