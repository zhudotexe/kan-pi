In order to qualify for this list, a structure must:\n\n\n\n* be a recognisable building;\n* incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9\u00a0ft) in height;\n* be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.\n* contain an enclosed area with at least one entry point.\n\n\nThis deliberately excludes ruins of limited height and statues. The list also excludes:\n\n\n\n* dolmens, a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone. Dolmens were typically covered with earth or smaller stones to form a tumulus (which are included in the list). In many instances, that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone \"skeleton\" of the burial mound intact. Neolithic dolmens are extremely numerous, with over 1,000 reported from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany alone.[1]\n* cairns, which are simply large piles of loose stones (as opposed to chambered cairns)\n* standing stone rings, such as Stonehenge, also do not count because they are not enclosed and do not have roofs.\n\n\nDates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by radiocarbon dating and should be considered approximate.\n\n\n\n## By age[edit]\n\n\nThe following are amongst the oldest buildings in the world that have maintained the requirements to be such. Occupation sites with older human made structures such as those in G\u00f6bekli Tepe do exist, but the structures are monuments and do not meet the definition of building (which can be seen above). Many of the buildings within the list contain primarily bricks, but most importantly maintain their walls and roof. There are numerous extant structures that survive in the Orkney islands of Scotland, some of the best known of which are part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site.[2] The list also contains many large buildings from the Egyptian Age of the Pyramids.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Building\n | Image\n | Country\n | Continent\n | First built\n | Use\n | Note\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G\u00f6bekli Tepe | ![](image) | Turkey | Asia | 9500\u20137500\u00a0BC\n | Place of worship | Located in southern Turkey. The tell includes two phases of use, believed to be of a social or ritual nature by site discoverer and excavator Klaus Schmidt, dating back to the 10th\u20138th millennium BC. The structure is 300 m in diameter and 15 m high.\n |\n| Tower of Jericho | ![](image) | West Bank, Palestine | Asia | 8000 BC\n | Tower\n | is an 8.5-metre-tall (28\u00a0ft) stone structure, constructed of undressed stones, with an internal staircase of twenty-two steps.\n |\n| \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck | ![](image) | Turkey | Asia | 7500\u20135700\u00a0BC\n | Settlement\n | A very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic proto-city settlement in southern Anatolia |\n| Mehrgarh | ![](image) | Pakistan | Asia | 7000 BC\n | Settlement\n | A Neolithic archaeological site situated on the Kacchi Plain of Balochistan in Pakistan.

The settlement was inhabited from c. 9500 to at least 8000 BCE,[6] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars\u2014the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft)-high, 8\u00a0ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[7] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.\n\n\nThe site was first used at the dawn of the Southwest Asian Neolithic period, which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. G\u00f6bekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation produced to date, has played a prominent role in this debate. \n\n\nCurrent excavators interpret G\u00f6bekli Tepe as a settlement, based on recent findings such as domestic structures and features, water supply installations, and Neolithic tools associated with domestic use.[8] The site's original excavator Klaus Schmidt had described it as a sanctuary used by groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers from a wide area, with few or no permanent inhabitants.[1]\n\n\nNo definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic enclosures; Schmidt had described them as the \"world's first temple[s]\" that were intentionally and ritually backfilled. However, recent stratigraphic studies revealed that they had been filled by slope slide events, and were sometimes repaired and modified thereafter.[9]\n\n\nThe site was first noted in a survey in 1963. Schmidt recognized its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year. After his death in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. G\u00f6bekli Tepe was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Present day landscape around G\u00f6bekli TepeG\u00f6bekli Tepe is located in the Ta\u015f Tepeler ('Stone Hills'), in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains.[12] It overlooks the Harran plain and the headwaters of the Balikh River, a tributary of the Euphrates.[12] The site is a tell (artificial mound) situated on a flat limestone plateau.[13] In the north, the plateau is connected to the neighbouring mountains by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.[14]\n\n\nLike most Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) sites in the Urfa region, G\u00f6bekli Tepe was built on a high point on the edge of the mountains, giving it both a wide view over the plain beneath, and good visibility from the plain.[15] This location also gave the builders good access to raw material: the soft limestone bedrock from which the complex was built, and the flint to make the tools to work the limestone.[15]\n\n\nExcavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south, and west of a mulberry that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,[16] but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools. At the western escarpment, a small cave has been discovered in which a small relief depicting a bovid was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.[17]\n\n\n\n## Dawn of village life[edit]\n\n\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN, c.\u20099600\u20137000 BCE).[18] Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks \"the beginnings of village life\",[19] producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world.[19][20] Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places,[21][22] and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions.[23][24] Archaeologists divide the Pre-Pottery Neolithic into two subperiods: the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA, c.\u20099600\u20138800 BCE) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, c.\u20098800 and 7000 BCE).[20] The earliest phases at G\u00f6bekli Tepe have been dated to the PPNA; later phases to the PPNB.[25]\n\n\nPPN villages consisted mainly of clusters of stone or mud brick houses,[19] but sometimes also substantial monuments and large buildings.[20] These include the tower and walls at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), as well as large, roughly contemporaneous circular buildings at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, Wadi Feynan 16, Jerf el-Ahmar, Tell 'Abr 3, and Tepe Asiab.[26] Archaeologists typically associate these structures with communal activities which, together with the communal effort needed to build them, helped to maintain social interactions in PPN communities as they grew in size.[27]\n\n\nThe T-shaped pillar tradition seen at G\u00f6bekli Tepe is unique to the Urfa region, but is found at the majority of PPN sites there.[28] These include Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, Hamzan Tepe,[29] Karahan Tepe,[30] Harbetsuvan Tepesi,[31] Sefer Tepe,[28] and Tasl\u0131 Tepe.[32] Other stone stelae\u2014without the characteristic T shape\u2014have been documented at contemporary sites further afield, including \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, Qermez Dere, and Gusir H\u00f6y\u00fck.[33]\n\n\n\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe is located in \u015eanl\u0131urfa](image)![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe\n![Karahan Tepe\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0](image)\nKarahan Tepe\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori](image)\nNeval\u0131 \u00c7ori\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\n![G\u00f6bekli Tepe](image)\nclass=notpageimage|\nKnown PPN sites in the Urfa region.[15][32][31] Sites with T-shaped pillars are marked with ![](image).\n\n## Diet[edit]\n\n\nAt the time when G\u00f6bekli Tepe was occupied, the climate of the area was warmer and wetter than it is today.[13] It was surrounded by an open steppe grassland,[13] with abundant wild cereals, including einkorn, wheat, and barley,[34] and herds of grazing animals such as wild sheep, wild goat, gazelle, and equids.[35] Large herds of goitered gazelle may have passed by the site in seasonal migrations.[36] There is no evidence of substantial woodlands nearby;[13] 90% of the charcoal recovered at the site was from pistachio or almond trees.[37]\n\n\nArchaeologists have long associated the appearance of these settlements with the Neolithic Revolution\u2014the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture\u2014but disagree on whether the adoption of farming caused people to settle down, or settling down caused people to adopt farming.[38] Despite the name, the Neolithic Revolution in Southwest Asia was \"drawn out and locally variable\".[39]\n\n\nEvidence indicates the inhabitants of G\u00f6bekli Tepe were hunter-gatherers who supplemented their diet with early forms of domesticated cereal and lived in villages for at least part of the year. Tools such as grinding stones and mortars and pestles found at the site have been analyzed and suggest considerable cereal processing. Archaeozoological evidence hints at \"large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn.\"[40]\n\n\nThe village acquired drinking water through a rainwater harvesting system, consisting of carved channels[41] that fed several cisterns carved into the bedrock under the site,[42] which could hold at least 150 cubic metres (5,300\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of water.[40][43] Additionally, the local water table may have been higher, activating springs closer to the site that are dormant today.[44]\n\n\n\n## Chronology[edit]\n\n\nRadiocarbon dating shows that the earliest exposed structures at G\u00f6bekli Tepe were built between 9500 and 9000 BCE, towards the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period.[9][25] The site was significantly expanded in the early 9th millennium BCE and remained in use until around 8000 BCE, or perhaps slightly later (the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, PPNB).[25] There is evidence that smaller groups returned to live amongst the ruins after the Neolithic structures were abandoned.[25]\n\n\nSchmidt originally dated the site to the PPN based on the types of stone tools found there, considering a PPNA date \"most probable\".[45] Establishing its absolute chronology took longer due to methodological challenges.[46][47] Though the first two radiocarbon dates were published in 1998,[48] these and other samples from the fill of the structure dated to the late 10th and early 9th millennium \u2013 500 to 1000 years later than expected for a PPNA site.[46] Schmidt's team explained the discrepancy in light of their theory that this material was brought to the site from elsewhere when it was abandoned, and so was not representative of the actual use of the structures.[46][47] They instead turned to a novel method of dating organic material preserved in the plaster on the structure's walls, which resulted in dates more consistent with a PPNA occupation, in the middle or even early 10th-millennium BCE.[49][50][9] Subsequent research led to a significant revision of Schmidt's chronology, including the abandonment of the hypothesis that the fill of the structures was brought from elsewhere, and a recognition that direct dates on plaster are affected by the old wood effect.[51] Together with new radiocarbon dates, this has established the site's absolute chronology as falling in the period 9500 to 8000 BCE \u2013 the late PPNA and PPNB.[1][52]\n\n\n\n### Building phases[edit]\n\n\nThe preliminary, now abandoned,[53] stratigraphic model by Klaus Schmidt consisted of three architectural layers. The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.[9]\n\n\nThe revised chronology consists of eight phases that span at least 1,500 years. It details the history of the large circular enclosures, including events that led to their alteration or abandonment, and the evolution of the domestic buildings surrounding them.[54]\n\n\n\n* **Phase 1**: The earliest settlement phase includes the first versions of enclosures A to D and round-oval domestic structures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle.[53]\n\n\n* **Phase 2:** In the second phase (early 9th millennium BC) significant modifications of enclosures A-D were undertaken: New walls were erected, which incorporated the first monolithic T-shaped pillars. An increasing number of domestic structures were built, still mostly oval-round, though with a rising tendency for a rectangular floor plan.[53]\n\n\n* **Phases 3\u20135:** In the early PPNB, the northern and western slopes saw the erection of rectangular (domestic) structures. They underwent multiple construction phases, for instance, the addition of benches with incorporated T-shaped pillar, and new inner walls resulting in more rectangular rooms. The large enclosures were modified as well. Walls were repaired and new ones added. Benches were placed against the interior sides of phase 2 walls.[54]  \n At the end of the early PPNB, a slope slide inundated the lower lying structures, flushing sediments and domestic rubble (likely including midden and burials) downhill. This caused extensive damage to enclosure D, and led to stabilization works in Phase 5. Building C was reconstructed for the last time, and a terrace wall was placed above it, to prevent future slope-slides. Nonetheless, a second major slope-slide event occurred, which likely resulted in enclosure D being abandoned in the late 9th millennium BC.[54]\n\n\n* **Phases 6 and 7:** Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early 8th millennium BC). The loss of enclosures B and D may have led to the construction of building G and the \"Lion Pillar Building\". In Phase 7 another terrace wall was constructed in a last attempt to stabilize the northern slope.[55]\n\n\n* **Phase 8:** In the final occupation period, small habitation structures were built within the remains of the abandoned Neolithic village.[55]\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the main excavation area, showing circular enclosures A, B, C and D and a number of rectangular structures.\n### Large enclosures[edit]\n\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds first appear. They range from 10 to 30\u00a0m (33 to 98\u00a0ft) in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.[56] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.[57]\n\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.[58] Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelle, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; arthropods such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013Dust Bowl conditions prevalent today.[59] Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck and Jericho.\n\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.[60] Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of terrazzo (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.[61] Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles around 9000 BCE.\n\n\nLater enclosures were rectangular in shape, perhaps to make more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,[62] but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture,[63] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.[64] Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.[65]\n\n\n\n* ![Enclosure B](image)\n\nEnclosure B\n* ![Enclosure C](image)\n\nEnclosure C\n* ![Enclosure F](image)\n\nEnclosure F\n\n\n### Slope slide events[edit]\n\n\nThe enclosures, lying over 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) below the highest areas of the settlement, were subject to several slope slide events during the occupation period of G\u00f6bekli Tepe.[66] A particularly severe one occurred at the end early PPNB. which inundated enclosure D with rubble of domestic structures and sediments, including burials and midden deposits. This caused severe damage to the enclosure, which led to repairs and stabilization works to be conducted. At a later point, in Building Phase 5, terrace walls were erected, likely to prevent future damage from such events. These measures, however, proved futile, when a second major slope slide probably caused the enclosure to the abandoned during Building Phase 6, around the late 9th millennium BC. Other enclosure suffered a similar fate, which might have led to new enclosures being constructed to replace them.[54]\n\n\nPreviously, it had been assumed that the large enclosures were intentionally back-filled, an interpretation that has fallen out of favor since Klaus Schmidt's death.[67]\n\n\n\n### Domestic structures[edit]\n\n\nIn the earliest occupation phase, round-oval domestic structures were built alongside the large enclosures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle. Over time there was an increasing tendency of these buildings to have a rectangular floor plan. In the final settlement phase only small structures were erected.[54]\n\n\n\n### Burials[edit]\n\n\nBefore any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building.[59] In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult.[18] Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period at sites such as 'Ain Mallaha, Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), and Yiftahel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Other structures[edit]\n\n\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.[68] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.[17]\n\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex\u00a0E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex\u00a0E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.[69]\n\n\n\n### Later structures[edit]\n\n\nThe uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\n\nAround the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE, G\u00f6bekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities.\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe plateau G\u00f6bekli Tepe is situated on has been shaped by erosion and quarrying from the Neolithic onwards. There are four 10-metre-long (33\u00a0ft) and 20-centimetre-wide (7.9\u00a0in) channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the *Limes Arabicus*, though this is conjecture.[70] Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.[70] Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3\u00a0metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and its head has a width of 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft). Its weight may be around 50\u00a0tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nArchaeologists disagree on how much labour was needed to construct the site. Schmidt maintained that \"the work of quarrying, transporting, and erecting tons of heavy, monolithic, and almost universally well-prepared limestone pillars [...] was not within the capability of a few people\".[71] Using Thor Heyerdahl's experiments with the moai of Rapa Nui as a reference, he estimated that moving the pillars alone must have involved hundreds of people.[44] According to these experiments, one *moai* of similar size to a T-shaped pillar from G\u00f6bekli Tepe would have taken 20 people a year to carve, and 50\u201375 people a week to transport 15\u00a0km.[72] Schmidt's team has also cited a 1917 account of the construction of a megalith on the Indonesian island of Nias, which took 525 people three days.[44][72] These estimates underpin their interpretation that the site was built by a large, non-resident workforce,[73] coerced or enticed there by a small religious elite.[74][75] However, others estimate that just 7\u201314 people could have moved the pillars using ropes and water or another lubricant, with techniques used to construct other monuments such as Stonehenge.[44] Experiments at G\u00f6bekli Tepe itself have suggested that all the PPNB structures currently exposed could have been built by 12\u201324 people in less than four months, allowing for time spent quarrying stone and gathering, and preparing food.[76] These labour estimates are thought to be within the capability of a single extended family or village community in the Neolithic.[44] They also match the number of people that could have comfortably been inside one of the buildings at the same time.[77]\n\n\nEnclosures B, C and D were initially planned as a single, hierarchical complex that forms an equilateral triangle, according to Haklay and Gopher.[78]\n\n\n\n## Tools[edit]\n\n\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe is littered with flint artifacts, from the ridge-top site to the slopes.[79] The tool assemblage found resembles that of other Northern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic (settlement) sites.[80]\n\n\nIn 1963, over 3,000 Neolithic tools were uncovered, the vast majority of excellent quality flint, only a handful of obsidian. Cores, various blades, flakes, scrapers, burins, and projectile points, were the most common tool types.[81]\n\n\nExcavations of Space 16, a small building adjacent to enclosure D, yielded almost 700 tools. Most common were retouched artifacts, followed by scrapers, perforators and artifacts with gloss. Heavy duty tools, burins and microliths were also present.[82]\n\n\n\n## Iconography[edit]\n\n\n### Pillars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reproduction of the central pillars of Enclosure\u00a0D in the \u015eanl\u0131urfa museum: engraved arms are visible on the shaft.\nThe stone pillars in the enclosures at G\u00f6bekli Tepe are T-shaped, similar to other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the region.[83] Unlike at these other sites, however, many of the pillars are carved \u2013 typically in low relief, though sometimes in high relief. Most carvings depict animals, mostly serpents, foxes, and boars, but also gazelle, mouflon (wild sheep), onager, ducks, and vultures. Insofar as they can be identified, the animals are male, and often depicted with an aggressive posture.[84][85]\n\n\nAbstract shapes are also depicted, mostly an upright or horizontal 'H'-shaped symbol, but also crescents and disks. Depictions of humans are rare; pillar\u00a043 in enclosure\u00a0D includes a headless man with an erect phallus. However, the 'T'-shape of the pillars themselves is anthropomorphic: the shaft is the body, and the top is the head. This is confirmed by the fact that some pillars include \u2013 in addition to animal reliefs \u2013 carvings of arms, hands, and loincloths.[86]\n\n\nThe two central pillars occupied a special place in the symbolic architecture of the enclosures. Those in Enclosure\u00a0D represent humans, with arms, a belt, and a piece of cloth that hides the genitals. The sex of the individuals depicted cannot be clearly identified, though Schmidt suggested that they are two men because the belts they wear are a male attribute in the period. There is only one certain representation of a woman, depicted naked on a slab.[86]\n\n\nSchmidt and zooarchaeologist Joris Peters have argued that the variety of fauna depicted on the pillars means they likely do not express a single iconography. They suggest that, since many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation, or served as totems.[87]\n\n\n\n* ![Pillar\u00a010, Enclosure\u00a0B: fox](image)\n\nPillar\u00a010, Enclosure\u00a0B: fox\n* ![Pillar\u00a012, Enclosure\u00a0C: ducks and boar](image)\n\nPillar\u00a012, Enclosure\u00a0C: ducks and boar\n* ![Pillar\u00a027, Enclosure\u00a0C: predator (perhaps a felid) hunting a boar](image)\n\nPillar\u00a027, Enclosure\u00a0C: predator (perhaps a felid) hunting a boar\n* ![Pillar\u00a037 (central), Enclosure\u00a0C: fox](image)\n\nPillar\u00a037 (central), Enclosure\u00a0C: fox\n* ![Pillar\u00a043, Enclosure\u00a0D: the \"Vulture Stone\"](image)\n\nPillar\u00a043, Enclosure\u00a0D: the \"Vulture Stone\"\n\n\n### Other objects[edit]\n\n\nThe structures at G\u00f6bekli Tepe have also yielded a number of smaller carved stones, which typically cannot be attributed to one period or another. The iconography of these objects is similar to that of the pillars, mostly depicting animals, but also humans, again primarily male.[88][89]\n\n\n\n* ![Carved stone with animal (possibly a reptile, felid, or wolverine) in high relief](image)\n\nCarved stone with animal (possibly a reptile, felid, or wolverine) in high relief\n* ![Boar statuette with legs](image)\n\nBoar statuette with legs\n* ![Sculptured stone pole](image)\n\nSculptured stone pole\n* ![Boar statuette without legs](image)\n\nBoar statuette without legs\n* ![Head of an animal](image)\n\nHead of an animal\n\n\nA \"totem pole\" was discovered in one of the structures, dating to the early PPNB. Reassembled, it is 192 centimetres (6.30\u00a0ft) tall and 30 centimetres (0.98\u00a0ft) in diameter. It depicts three figures (from top to bottom): a predator (a bear or large felid) with a missing head, and the neck and arms of a human; another figure missing a head with human arms, likely male; and a third figure with a head that had survived intact. Snakes are carved on either side.[90]\n\n\n\n## Interpretation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(November 2022)*\n |\n\n\nKlaus Schmidt's view was that G\u00f6bekli Tepe was a stone-age mountain sanctuary.[*citation needed*] He suggested it was a central location for a cult of the dead and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead.[*citation needed*] Butchered bones found in large numbers from the local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.[91] Zooarchaeological analysis shows that gazelle were only seasonally present in the region, suggesting that events such as rituals and feasts were likely timed to occur during periods when game availability was at its peak.[36] Schmidt saw the construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe as contributing to the later development of urban civilization.[92]\n\n![](image)Steles and sculptures from G\u00f6bekli Tepe in \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum\nSchmidt also speculated on the belief systems of the groups that created G\u00f6bekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He presumed shamanic practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in Mesopotamia, that was associated with extensive temples and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain Ekur, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.[93] It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.[59][94][95] Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the G\u00f6bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.[96]\n\n\nThe assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"[44] It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.[97] According to R\u00e9mi Hadad, in recent years \"the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see G\u00f6bekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.\"[98] For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the 'temple' narrative.[1]\n\n\n\n## Research history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Klaus Schmidt delivering a lecture in Salzburg, 2014.\nBefore being documented by archaeologists, the hill G\u00f6bekli Tepe stands on, known locally in Kurdish as Gir\u00ea Mirazan or Xerabre\u015fk, was considered a sacred place.[99][100]\n\n\nThe archaeological site was first noted in a survey conducted by Istanbul University and the University of Chicago in 1963.[101] American archaeologist Peter Benedict identified the stone tools collected from the surface of site as characteristic of the Aceramic Neolithic,[102] but apparently mistook the upper parts of the T-shaped pillars for grave markers.[103] The hill had long been under agricultural cultivation, and generations of local inhabitants had frequently moved rocks and placed them in clearance piles, which may have disturbed the upper layers of the site. At some point, attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks.[59]\n\n\nIn October 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, who had previously been working at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, was looking for evidence of similar sites in the area and decided to re-examine the location described by the Chicago researchers in 1963.[59][104] Asking in nearby villages about hills with flint,[104] he was guided to G\u00f6bekli Tepe by Mahmut and \u0130brahim Y\u0131ld\u0131z, the farmers who owned the land the site was situated on.[100] Mahmut Y\u0131ld\u0131z and his father had previously discovered finds while ploughing there, which they reported to the local museum.[100] Having found similar structures at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, Schmidt recognized the possibility that the stone slabs were not grave markers as supposed by Benedict, but the tops of prehistoric megaliths. He began excavations the following year and soon unearthed the first of the huge T-shaped pillars.[59] Ultimately he found only three tombs on the eastmost hill-group, which were a pilgrimage destination.[105] Y\u0131ld\u0131z went on to work on the excavations and serve as the site's guard.[100]\n\n\nSchmidt continued to direct excavations at the site on behalf of the \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum and the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) until his death in 2014. Since then, the DAI's research at the site has been coordinated by Lee Clare.[106][1] As of 2021[update], work on the site is conducted jointly by Istanbul University, the \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum, and the DAI, under the overall direction of Necmi Karul.[107][108] Recent excavations have been more limited than Schmidt's, focusing on detailed documentation and conservation of the areas already exposed.[108]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protective roof added to the site\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\nConservation work at the site caused controversy in 2018, when \u00c7i\u011fdem K\u00f6ksal Schmidt, an archaeologist, and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said that damage was caused by the use of concrete and \"heavy equipment\" during the construction of a new walkway. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.[109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Archaeoastronomy\u00a0\u2013 Interdisciplinary study of astronomies in cultures\n* Boncuklu Tarla\n* G\u00fcrc\u00fctepe\u00a0\u2013 Archaeological site in Turkey\n* List of archaeological sites by continent and age\n* List of largest monoliths\n* Prehistoric religion\u00a0\u2013 Religion before written records\n* Pseudoarchaeology\u00a0\u2013 Scientifically insubstantial theories interpreting archaeology\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **has an unclear citation style**.

Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated to much earlier, to the Neolithic, which is the latest part of the Stone Age, and were part of an early proto-city.[4] The tower highlights the importance of Jericho for the understanding of settlement patterns in the Sultanian period in the Southern Levant.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A model of the tower\nThe tower was constructed using undressed stones, with an internal staircase of twenty-two steps. Conical in shape, the tower is almost 9 metres (30\u00a0ft) in diameter at the base, decreasing to 7 metres (23\u00a0ft) at the top with walls approximately 1.5 metres (4.9\u00a0ft) thick. The construction of the tower is estimated to have taken 11,000 working days.\n\n\n\n## Purpose[edit]\n\n\nStudies by Ran Barkai and Roy Liran from Tel Aviv University published in 2011 have suggested astronomical and social purposes in the construction of the tower. Showing an early example of archaeoastronomy, they used computer modelling to determine that the shadow of nearby mountains first hit the tower on the sunset of the summer solstice and then spread across the entire town.[3] Noting that there were no known invasions of the area at the time of construction, the defensive purpose of the tower, wall and ditch at Jericho has been brought into question. No burials were found and suggestions of it being a tomb have been dismissed.\n\n\nDiscussing in *The Jerusalem Post*, Barkai argued that the structure was used to create awe and inspiration to convince people into a harder way of life with the development of agriculture and social hierarchies. He concluded: \"We believe this tower was one of the mechanisms to motivate people to take part in a communal lifestyle.\"[1]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Palestine portal\n* ![](image)History portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* List of megalithic sites\n\n\n\n\n| Records\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byTell Qaramel\n |  **World's tallest structure[6]** c. 8000 BC - c. 2650 BC8.5 m | Succeeded\u00a0byPyramid of Djoser\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** O'Sullivan, Arieh (14 February 2011). \"World's first skyscraper sought to intimidate masses\". *The Jerusalem Post*.\n2. **^** \"Esra Magazine - THE ROUND STONE TOWER OF JERICHO\". 26 November 2016.

The eastern settlement forms a mound that would have risen about 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) above the plain at the time of the latest Neolithic occupation. There is also a smaller settlement mound to the west and a Byzantine settlement a few hundred meters to the east. The prehistoric mound settlements were abandoned before the Bronze Age. A channel of the \u00c7ar\u015famba River once flowed between the two mounds, and the settlement was built on alluvial clay which may have been favorable for early agriculture. Currently the closest river to it is the Euphrates.\n\n\n\n\n## Archaeology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of the neolithic settlement ( 7300 BC ) of Catal H\u00f6y\u00fck\nThe site was first excavated by James Mellaart in 1958. He later led a team which further excavated there for four seasons between 1961 and 1965.[4][5][6][7] These excavations revealed this section of Anatolia as a centre of advanced culture in the Neolithic period.[8] Excavation revealed 18 successive layers of buildings signifying various stages of the settlement and eras of history. The bottom layer of buildings can be dated as early as 7100 BC while the top layer is from 5600 BC.[9]\n\n\nMellaart was banned from Turkey for his involvement in the Dorak affair in which he published drawings of supposedly important Bronze Age artifacts that later went missing.[10] After this scandal, the site lay idle until 1993, when investigations began under the leadership of Ian Hodder, then at the University of Cambridge.[11][12][13][14][15] The Hodder led excavations ended in 2018. Hodder, a former student of Mellaart, chose the site as the first \"real world\" test of his then-controversial theory of post-processual archaeology.[16] The site has always had a strong research emphasis upon engagement with digital methodologies, driven by the project's experimental and reflexive methodological framework.[17] According to Mickel, Hodder's \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck Research Project (\u00c7RP) established itself as a site for progressive methodologies - in terms of adaptable and democratized recording, integration of computerized technologies, sampling strategies, and community involvement.\"[18]\n\n\nNew excavations are being directed by Ali Umut T\u00fcrkcan from Anadolu University.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)On-site restoration of a typical interior.\n![](image)The earliest excavations of the site.\n![](image)Deep trenches in the site.\nAnimation showing a reconstruction of Catalh\u00f6y\u00fck, German narration with English subtitles\n\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was composed entirely of domestic buildings, with no obvious public buildings. While some of the larger ones have rather ornate murals, the purpose of some rooms remains unclear.[8]\n\n\nThe population of the eastern mound has been estimated to be around 10,000 people, but the population likely varied over the community's history. An average population of between 5,000 and 7,000 is a reasonable estimate. The sites were set up as large numbers of buildings clustered together. Households looked to their neighbors for help, trade, and possible marriage for their children.[19] The inhabitants lived in mudbrick houses that were crammed together in an aggregate structure. No footpaths or streets were used between the dwellings, which were clustered in a honeycomb-like maze. Most were accessed by holes in the ceiling and doors on the side of the houses, with doors reached by ladders and stairs. The rooftops were effectively streets. The ceiling openings also served as the only source of ventilation, allowing smoke from the houses' open hearths and ovens to escape. \nHouses had plaster interiors characterized by squared-off timber ladders or steep stairs. These were usually on the south wall of the room, as were cooking hearths and ovens. The main rooms contained raised platforms that may have been used for a range of domestic activities. Typical houses contained two rooms for everyday activity, such as cooking and crafting.[19] All interior walls and platforms were plastered to a smooth finish.[8] Ancillary rooms were used as storage, and were accessed through low openings from main rooms.\n\n\nAll rooms were kept scrupulously clean. Archaeologists identified very little rubbish in the buildings, finding middens outside the ruins, with sewage and food waste, as well as significant amounts of ash from burning wood, reeds and animal dung.[20] In good weather, many daily activities may also have taken place on the rooftops, which may have formed a plaza. In later periods, large communal ovens appear to have been built on these rooftops. Over time, houses were renewed by partial demolition and rebuilding on a foundation of rubble, which was how the mound was gradually built up. As many as eighteen levels of settlement have been uncovered.[21]\n\n\nAs a part of ritual life, the people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck buried their dead within the village.[19] Human remains have been found in pits beneath the floors and, especially, beneath hearths, the platforms within the main rooms, and under beds. Bodies were tightly flexed before burial and were often placed in baskets or wound and wrapped in reed mats. Disarticulated bones in some graves suggest that bodies may have been exposed in the open air for a time before the bones were gathered and buried. In some cases, graves were disturbed, and the individual's head removed from the skeleton. These heads may have been used in rituals, as some were found in other areas of the community. In a woman's grave spinning whorls were recovered and in a man's grave, stone axes.[19] Some skulls were plastered and painted with ochre to recreate faces, a custom more characteristic of Neolithic sites in Syria and at Neolithic Jericho than at sites closer by.\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail of the mural showing the hind part of the aurochs, a deer and hunters.\nVivid murals and figurines are found throughout the settlement, on interior and exterior walls. Distinctive clay figurines of women, notably the Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, have been found in the upper levels of the site.[22] Although no identifiable temples have been found, the graves, murals, and figurines suggest that the people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck had a religion rich in symbols. Rooms with concentrations of these items may have been shrines or public meeting areas. Predominant images include men with erect phalluses, hunting scenes, red images of the now extinct aurochs (wild cattle) and stags, and vultures swooping down on headless figures.[8] Relief figures are carved on walls, such as of lionesses facing one another.\n\n\nHeads of animals, especially of cattle, were mounted on walls. A painting of the village, with the twin mountain peaks of Hasan Da\u011f in the background,[23] is frequently cited as the world's oldest map,[24] and the first landscape painting.[8] However, some archaeologists question this interpretation. Stephanie Meece, for example, argues that it is more likely a painting of a leopard skin instead of a volcano, and a decorative geometric design instead of a map.[25]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mural, Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.\n![](image)Neolithic hunters attacking an aurochs, Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.\n![](image)Seated goddess flanked by two felines, leopards or lionesses\nSee also: History of religion\n\nA feature of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck are its female figurines. Mellaart, the original excavator, argued that these carefully made figurines, carved and molded from marble, blue and brown limestone, schist, calcite, basalt, alabaster, and clay, represented a female deity. Although a male deity existed as well, \"statues of a female deity far outnumber those of the male deity, who moreover, does not appear to be represented at all after Level\u00a0VI\".[26] To date, eighteen levels have been identified. These figurines were found primarily in areas Mellaart believed to be shrines. The stately goddess seated on a throne flanked by two lionesses was found in a grain bin, which Mellaart suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.[27]\n\n\nWhereas Mellaart excavated nearly two hundred buildings in four seasons, the current excavator, Ian Hodder, spent an entire season excavating one building alone.[28] Hodder and his team, in 2004 and 2005, began to believe that the patterns suggested by Mellaart were false. They found one similar figurine, but the vast majority did not imitate the Mother Goddess style that Mellaart suggested. Instead of a Mother Goddess culture, Hodder points out that the site gives little indication of a matriarchy or patriarchy.[29]\n\n\n\n\n> \"There are full breasts on which the hands rest, and the stomach is extended in the central part. There is a hole in the top for the head which is missing. As one turns the figurine around one notices that the arms are very thin, and then on the back of the figurine one sees a depiction of either a skeleton or the bones of a very thin and depleted human. The ribs and vertebrae are clear, as are the scapulae and the main pelvic bones. The figurine can be interpreted in a number of ways \u2013 as a woman turning into an ancestor, as a woman associated with death, or as death and life conjoined. It is possible that the lines around the body represent wrapping rather than ribs. Whatever the specific interpretation, this is a unique piece that may force us to change our views of the nature of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck society and imagery. Perhaps the importance of female imagery was related to some special role of the female in relation to death as much as to the roles of mother and nurturer.\"[30]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn an article in the *Turkish Daily News*, Hodder is reported as denying that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was a matriarchal society and quoted as saying \"When we look at what they eat and drink and at their social statues, we see that men and women had the same social status. There was a balance of power. Another example is the skulls found. If one's social status was of high importance in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, the body and head were separated after death. The number of female and male skulls found during the excavations is almost equal.\"[31] In another article in the *Hurriyet Daily News* Hodder is reported to say \"We have learned that men and women were equally approached\".[32]\n\n\nIn a report in September 2009 on the discovery of around 2000 figurines Hodder is quoted as saying:\n\n\n\n\n> \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was excavated in the 1960s in a methodical way, but not using the full range of natural science techniques that are available to us today. Sir James Mellaart who excavated the site in the 1960s came up with all sorts of ideas about the way the site was organized and how it was lived in and so on ... We\u2019ve now started working there since the mid 1990s and come up with very different ideas about the site. One of the most obvious examples of that is that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck is perhaps best known for the idea of the mother goddess. But our work more recently has tended to show that in fact there is very little evidence of a mother goddess and very little evidence of some sort of female-based matriarchy. That's just one of the many myths that the modern scientific work is undermining.[33]\n> \n> \n\n\nProfessor Lynn Meskell explained that while the original excavations had found only 200 figures, the new excavations had uncovered 2,000 figures, most of which depicted animals, and fewer than 5% of the figurines depicted women.[33]\n\n\nEstonian folklorist Uku Masing has suggested as early as in 1976, that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was probably a hunting and gathering religion and the Mother Goddess figurine did not represent a female deity. He implied that perhaps a longer period of time was needed to develop symbols for agricultural rites.[34] His theory was developed in the paper \"Some remarks on the mythology of the people of Catal H\u00fcy\u00fck\".[35]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck has strong evidence of an egalitarian society, as no houses with distinctive features (belonging to royalty or religious hierarchy, for example) have been found so far. The most recent investigations also reveal little social distinction based on gender, with men and women receiving equivalent nutrition and seeming to have equal social status, as typically found in Paleolithic cultures.[36][37] Children observed domestic areas. They learned how to perform rituals and how to build or repair houses by watching the adults make statues, beads and other objects.[19]\n\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck's spatial layout may be due to the close kin relations exhibited amongst the people. It can be seen, in the layout, that the people were \"divided into two groups who lived on opposite sides of the town, separated by a gully.\" Furthermore, because no nearby towns were found from which marriage partners could be drawn, \"this spatial separation must have marked two intermarrying kinship groups.\" This would help explain how a settlement so early on would become so large.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protective roof of the archeological site.\nIn the upper levels of the site, it becomes apparent that the people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck were honing skills in agriculture and the domestication of animals. Female figurines have been found within bins used for storage of cereals, such as wheat and barley, and the figurines are presumed to be of a deity protecting the grain. Peas were also grown, and almonds, pistachios and fruit were harvested from trees in the surrounding hills. Sheep were domesticated and evidence suggests the beginning of cattle domestication as well. However, hunting continued to be a major source of food for the community. Pottery and obsidian tools appear to have been major industries; obsidian tools were probably both used and also traded for items such as Mediterranean sea shells and flint from Syria. Noting the lack of hierarchy and economic inequality, historian and anti-capitalist author Murray Bookchin has argued that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was an early example of anarcho-communism.[39]\n\n\nConversely, a 2014 paper argues that the picture of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck is more complex and that while there seemed to have been an egalitarian distribution of cooking tools and some stone tools, unbroken quern-stones and storage units were more unevenly distributed. Private property existed but shared tools also existed. It was also suggested that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was becoming less egalitarian, with greater inter-generational wealth transmission.[40]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Boncuklu H\u00f6y\u00fck\n* Cities of the ancient Near East\n* Cucuteni\u2013Trypillian culture\n* G\u00f6bekli Tepe\n* Kamyana Mohyla\n* List of largest cities throughout history\n* List of Stone Age art\n* Matriarchy\n* Neolithic Revolution\n* Old Europe (archaeology)\n* Sacred bull\n* Venus figurines\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Shukurov, Anvar; Sarson, Graeme R.; Gangal, Kavita (7 May 2014). \"The Near-Eastern Roots of the Neolithic in South Asia\". *PLOS ONE*. **9** (5): Appendix S1.

The site was discovered in 1974 by the French Archaeological Mission[2] led by the French archaeologists Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jarrige and his wife, Catherine Jarrige. Mehrgarh was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986,[3] and again from 1997 to 2000.[4] Archaeological material has been found in six mounds, and about 32,000 artifacts have been collected from the site. The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh\u2014located in the northeast corner of the 495-acre (2.00\u00a0km2) site\u2014was a small farming village dated between 7000 BCE and 5500 BCE.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Neolithic Revolution, Fertile Crescent, Demic diffusion, and Dravidian peoples \u00a7\u00a0Origins\n\nMehrgarh is the earliest known site in South Asia showing evidence of farming and herding.[5][6][note 1] It was influenced by the Neolithic culture of the Near East,[16] with similarities between \"domesticated wheat varieties, early phases of farming, pottery, other archaeological artefacts, some domesticated plants and herd animals.\"[17][note 2] According to Asko Parpola , the culture migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age.[18]\n\n\nJean-Francois Jarrige argues for an independent origin of Mehrgarh. Jarrige notes \"the assumption that farming economy was introduced full-fledged from Near-East to South Asia,\"[19][note 2] and the similarities between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus Valley, which are evidence of a \"cultural continuum\" between those sites. However, given the originality of Mehrgarh, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background,\" and is not a \"'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East.\"[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Site location of Mehrgarh.\nLukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with continuity in cultural development but a population change.[35] According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the Chalcolithic population did not descend from the Neolithic population of Mehrgarh,[36] which \"suggests moderate levels of gene flow.\"[36] They wrote that \"the direct lineal descendants of the Neolithic inhabitants of Mehrgarh are to be found to the south and the east of Mehrgarh, Pakistan in northwestern India and the western edge of the Deccan Plateau,\" with Neolithic Mehrgarh showing greater affinity with Chalcolithic Inamgaon, south of Mehrgarh, than with Chalcolithic Mehrgarh. [36][note 3]\n\n\nGallego Romero et al. (2011) state that their research on lactose tolerance in India suggests that \"the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al. (2009) principally reflects gene flow from Pakistan, Iran and the Middle East.\"[39] Gallego Romero notes that Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is \"characteristic of the common European mutation.\"[40] According to Romero, this suggests that \"the most common lactose tolerance mutation made a two-way migration out of the Middle East less than 10,000 years ago. While the mutation spread across Europe, another explorer must have brought the mutation eastward to India \u2013 likely traveling along the coast of the Persian Gulf where other pockets of the same mutation have been found.\"[40] They further note that \"[t]he earliest evidence of cattle herding in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP.\"[39][note 4]\n\n\n\n## Periods of occupation[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists divide the occupation at the site into eight periods.\n\n\n\n### Mehrgarh Period I (pre-7000 BCE\u20135500 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nThe Mehrgarh Period I (pre-7000 BCE \u2013 5500 BCE)[note 5] was Neolithic and aceramic (without the use of pottery). The earliest farming in the area was developed by semi-nomadic people using plants such as wheat and barley and animals such as sheep, goats and cattle. The settlement was established with unbaked mud-brick buildings and most of them had four internal subdivisions. Numerous burials have been found, many with elaborate goods such as baskets, stone and bone tools, beads, bangles, pendants, and occasionally animal sacrifices, with more goods left with burials of males. Ornaments of sea shell, limestone, turquoise, lapis lazuli and sandstone have been found, along with simple figurines of women and animals. Seashells from far seashores, and lapis lazuli from as far away as present-day Badakshan, show good contact with those areas. One ground stone axe was discovered in a burial, and several more were obtained from the surface. These ground stone axes are the earliest to come from a stratified context in South Asia.\n\n\nPeriods I, II, and III are considered contemporaneous with another site called Kili Gul Mohammad.[43] The aceramic Neolithic phase in the region had originally been called the 'Kili Gul Muhammad phase'. While the Kili Gul Muhammad site, itself, probably started c.\u20095500 BC, the subsequent discoveries now allow to define the dates of 7000-5000 BC for this aceramic Neolithic phase.[44]\n\n\nIn 2001, archaeologists studying the remains of nine men from Mehrgarh discovered that the people of this civilization knew proto-dentistry. In April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal *Nature* that the oldest (and first *early Neolithic*) evidence for the drilling of human teeth *in vivo* (*i.e.* in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region. \"Here we describe eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Pakistan that dates from 7,500 to 9,000 years ago. These findings provide evidence for a long tradition of a type of proto-dentistry in early farming culture.\"[45]\n\n\n\n### Mehrgarh Period II (5500 BCE\u20134800 BCE) and Period III (4800 BCE\u20133500 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nThe Mehrgarh Period II (5500 BCE\u20134800 BCE) and Merhgarh Period III (4800 BCE\u20133500 BCE) were ceramic Neolithic, using pottery, and later chalcolithic. Period II is at site MR4 and Period III is at MR2.[46] Much evidence of manufacturing activity has been found and more advanced techniques were used. Glazed faience beads were produced and terracotta figurines became more detailed. Figurines of females were decorated with paint and had diverse hairstyles and ornaments. Two flexed burials were found in Period II with a red ochre cover on the body. The number of burial goods decreased over time, becoming limited to ornaments and with more goods left with burials of females. The first button seals were produced from terracotta and bone and had geometric designs. Technologies included stone and copper drills, updraft kilns, large pit kilns, and copper melting crucibles. There is further evidence of long-distance trade in Period II: important as an indication of this is the discovery of several beads of lapis lazuli, once again from Badakshan. Mehrgarh Periods II and III are also contemporaneous with an expansion of the settled populations of the borderlands at the western edge of South Asia, including the establishment of settlements like Rana Ghundai, Sheri Khan Tarakai, Sarai Kala, Jalilpur, and Ghaligai.[46]\n\n\nPeriod III was not much explored, but it was found that Togau phase (c.\u20094000-3500 BCE) was part of this level, covering around 100 hectares in the areas MR.2, MR.4, MR.5 and MR.6, encompassing ruins, burial and dumping grounds, but archaeologist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jarrige concluded that \"such wide extension was not due to contemporaneous occupation, but rather due to the shift and partial superimposition in time of several villages or settlement clusters across a span of several centuries.\"[47]\n\n\n\n#### Togau phase[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of Mehrgarh III, Togau ceramics appeared at the site. Togau ware was first defined by Beatrice de Cardi in 1948. Togau is a large mound in the Chhappar Valley of Sarawan, 12 kilometer northwest of Kalat in Baluchistan. This type of pottery is found widely in Baluchistan and eastern Afghanistan, at sites such as Mundigak, Sheri Khan Tarakai, and Periano Ghundai. According to Possehl it is attested at 84 sites up to date. Anjira is a contemporary ancient site near Togau.[48]\n\n\nTogau ceramics is decorated with geometric designs and was already made by using a potter's wheel.\n\n\nThe time in Mehrgarh Period III, during the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, is characterized by important new developments. There's a big increase in the number of settlements in the Quetta Valley, the Surab Region, the Kachhi Plain and elsewhere in the area. Kili Ghul Mohammad (II\u2212III) pottery is similar to Togau Ware.[49]\n\n\n\n### Mehrgarh Periods IV, V and VI (3500 BCE\u20133000 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nPeriod IV was 3500 to 3250\u00a0BCE. Period V from 3250 to 3000\u00a0BCE and period VI was around 3000\u00a0BCE.[50] The site containing Periods IV to VII is designated as MR1.[46]\n\n\n\n### Mehrgarh Period VII (2600 BCE\u20132000 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nSomewhere between 2600\u00a0BCE and 2000\u00a0BCE, the city seems to have been largely abandoned in favor of the larger and fortified town Nausharo five miles away when the Indus Valley civilisation was in its middle stages of development. Historian Michael Wood suggests this took place around 2500 BCE.[51]\n\n\nArchaeologist Massimo Vidale considers a series of semi-columns found in a structure at Mehrgarh, dated around 2500 BCE by the French mission there, is very similar to semi-columns found in Period IV at Shahr-e Sukhteh.[52]:\u200amin.12:10\n\n\n\n### Mehrgarh Period VIII[edit]\n\n\nThe last period is found at the Sibri cemetery, about 8\u00a0kilometers from Mehrgarh.[46]\n\n\n\n## Lifestyle and technology[edit]\n\n\nEarly Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500\u00a0BCE to 2600\u00a0BCE) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working.[53] Mehrgarh is probably the earliest known center of agriculture in South Asia.[54]\n\n\nThe oldest known example of the lost-wax technique comes from a 6,000-year-old wheel-shaped copper amulet found at Mehrgarh. The amulet was made from unalloyed copper, an unusual innovation that was later abandoned.[55]\n\n\n\n## Artifacts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seated Mother Goddess ,3000\u20132500 BC. Mehrgarh.[56]\n### Human figurines[edit]\n\n\nThe oldest ceramic figurines in South Asia were found at Mehrgarh. They occur in all phases of the settlement and were prevalent even before pottery appears. The earliest figurines are quite simple and do not show intricate features. However, they grow in sophistication with time, and by 4000\u00a0BC begins to show their characteristic hairstyles and typical prominent breasts. All the figurines up to this period were female. Male figurines appear only from period VII and gradually become more numerous. Many of the female figurines are holding babies, and were interpreted as depictions of the \"mother goddess\". However, due to some difficulties in conclusively identifying these figurines with the \"mother goddess\", some scholars prefer using the term \"female figurines with likely cultic significance\".[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n### Pottery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mehrgarh painted pottery. 3000-2500 BC.[60]\nEvidence of pottery begins from Period II. In period III, the finds become much more abundant as the potter's wheel is introduced, and they show more intricate designs and also animal motifs.[46] The characteristic female figurines appear beginning in Period IV and the finds show more intricate designs and sophistication. Pipal leaf designs are used in decoration from Period VI.[61] Some sophisticated firing techniques were used from Periods VI and VII and an area reserved for the pottery industry has been found at mound MR1. However, by Period VIII, the quality and intricacy of designs seem to have suffered due to mass production, and a growing interest in bronze and copper vessels.[50]\n\n\n\n### Burials[edit]\n\n\nThere are two types of burials in the Mehrgarh site. There were individual burials where a single individual was enclosed in narrow mud walls and collective burials with thin mud-brick walls within which skeletons of six different individuals were discovered. The bodies in the collective burials were kept in a flexed position and were laid east to west. Child bones were found in large jars or urn burials (4000~3300 BCE).[62]\n\n\n\n### Metallurgy[edit]\n\n\nMetal finds have dated as early as Period IIB, with a few copper items.[46][61]\n\n\n\n## See

archaeologist K. N. Dikshit, provided six artefacts, including \"relatively advanced pottery,\" so-called Hakra ware, which were dated at a time bracket between 7380 and 6201 BCE.[7][8][9][10] These dates compete with Mehrgarh for being the oldest site for cultural remains in the area.[11]  \n  \n Yet, Dikshit and Mani clarify that this time-bracket concerns only charcoal samples, which were radio-carbon dated at respectively 7570\u20137180 BCE (sample 2481) and 6689\u20136201 BCE (sample 2333).[12][13] Dikshit further writes that the earliest phase concerns 14 shallow dwelling-pits which \"could accommodate about 3\u20134 people.\"[14] According to Dikshit, in the lowest level of these pits wheel-made Hakra Ware was found which was \"not well finished,\"[14] together with other wares.[15]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** According to Gangal et al. (2014), there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the Near East into north-west India.[16][20] Gangal et al. (2014):[16] \"There are several lines of evidence that support the idea of a connection between the Neolithic in the Near East and the subcontinent. The prehistoric site of Mehrgarh in Baluchistan (modern Pakistan) is the earliest Neolithic site in the northwest of the subcontinent, dated as early as 8500 BCE.[18][21]  \n  \nNeolithic domesticated crops in Mehrgarh include more than 90% barley and a small amount of wheat. There is good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the zebu cattle at Mehrgarh [19],[22] [20],[23] but the wheat varieties are suggested to be of Near-Eastern origin, as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to Northern Levant and Southern Turkey [21].[24] A detailed satellite map study of a few archaeological sites in the Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regions also suggests similarities in early phases of farming with sites in Western Asia [22].[25] Pottery prepared by sequential slab construction, circular fire pits filled with burnt pebbles, and large granaries are common to both Mehrgarh and many Mesopotamian sites [23].[26] The postures of the skeletal remains in graves at Mehrgarh bear strong resemblance to those at Ali Kosh in the Zagros Mountains of southern Iran [19].[22] Clay figurines found in Mehrgarh resemble those discovered at Teppe Zagheh on the Qazvin plain south of the Elburz range in Iran (the 7th millennium BCE) and Jeitun in Turkmenistan (the 6th millennium BCE) [24].[27] Strong arguments have been made for the Near-Eastern origin of some domesticated plants and herd animals at Jeitun in Turkmenistan (pp. 225\u2013227 in [25]).[28]  \n  \nThe Near East is separated from the Indus Valley by the arid plateaus, ridges, and deserts of Iran and Afghanistan, where rainfall agriculture is possible only in the foothills and cul-de-sac valleys [26].[29] Nevertheless, this area was not an insurmountable obstacle for the dispersal of the Neolithic. The route south of the Caspian sea is a part of the Silk Road, some sections of which were in use from at least 3,000 BCE, connecting Badakhshan (north-eastern Afghanistan and south-eastern Tajikistan) with Western Asia, Egypt, and India [27].[30] Similarly, the section from Badakhshan to the Mesopotamian plains (the Great Khorasan Road) was apparently functioning by 4,000 BCE, and numerous prehistoric sites are located along with it, whose assemblages are dominated by the Cheshmeh-Ali (Tehran Plain) ceramic technology, forms and designs [26].[29] Striking similarities in figurines and pottery styles, and mud-brick shapes, between widely separated early Neolithic sites in the Zagros Mountains of north-western Iran (Jarmo and Sarab), the Deh Luran Plain in southwestern Iran (Tappeh Ali Kosh and Chogha Sefid), Susiana (Chogha Bonus and Chogha Mish), the Iranian Central Plateau (Tappeh-Sang-e Chakhmaq), and Turkmenistan (Jeitun) suggest a common incipient culture [28].[31] The Neolithic dispersal across South Asia plausibly involved migration of the population ([29][32] and [25], pp. 231\u2013233).[28] This possibility is also supported by Y-chromosome and mtDNA analyses [30],[33] [31].\"[34]\n3. **^** Genetic research shows a complex pattern of human migrations.[20] Kivisild et al. (1999) note that \"a small fraction of the West Eurasian mtDNA lineages found in Indian populations can be ascribed to a relatively recent admixture.\"[37] at ca. 9,300 \u00b1 3,000 years before present,[38] which coincides with \"the arrival to India of cereals domesticated in the Fertile Crescent\" and \"lends credence to the suggested linguistic connection between the Elamite and Dravidic populations.\"[38] Singh et al. (2016) investigated the distribution of J2a-M410 and J2b-M102 in South Asia, which \"suggested a complex scenario that cannot be explained by a single wave of agricultural expansion from Near East to South Asia,\"[20] but also notes that \"regardless of the complexity of dispersal, NW region appears to be the corridor for entry of these haplogroups into India.\"[20]\n4. **^** Gallego Romero et al.

It dates to the early Neolithic, about 4800 BC. Along with the Tumulus of Bougon and Locmariaquer megaliths, also located in Great West France, it is one of the earliest megalithic monuments in Europe and one of the oldest man-made structures in the world.[1] It is also remarkable for the presence of megalithic art.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the chambers, exposed by 20th century quarrying\n![](image)Artistic reconstruction of the cairn, c. 4000 BC\n### Dates[edit]\n\n\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that the first phase of the monument was erected between 4850 and 4250 BC, and the second phase between 4450 and 4000 BC.[3]\n\n\n\n### Secondary use[edit]\n\n\nPottery found in and around the monument indicates that it underwent a period of reuse in the Bronze Age, in the 3rd millennium BC.\n\n\n\n### Recognition as an ancient monument[edit]\n\n\nThe cairn was first mapped in 1807, in the context of the Napoleonic cadaster. Its first scientific recognition took place in the context of an academic congress in Morlaix in 1850, when it was classified as a tumulus.\n\n\n\n### Quarry damage[edit]\n\n\nPrivately owned until the 1950s, the cairn was used as a quarry for paving stones. This activity, which threatened to destroy the monument, was only halted after the discovery of several of its chambers in the 1950s. The local community then took control of the site.[3]\n\n\n\n### Restoration and excavation[edit]\n\n\nThe cairn was restored between 1954 and 1968. At the same time, vegetation was removed from the mound and systematic excavation took place in and around the monument.[4][5]\n\n\n\n## The monument[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the passages\n### The mound[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cairn of Barnenez\nToday, the Barnenez cairn is 72 m long, up to 25 m wide, and over 8 m high. It is built of 13,000 to 14,000 tons of stone. It contains 11 chambers entered by separate passages. The mound has steep facades and a stepped profile. Several internal walls either represent earlier facades or served the stability of the structure. The cairn consists of relatively small blocks of stone, with only the chambers being truly megalithic in character.\nThe monument overlooks the Bay of Morlaix, probably a fertile coastal plain at the time of its erection.\n\n\n\n![](image)Simplified plan. Cairn 1 marked in yellow, Cairn 2 in green.\n### Construction phases[edit]\n\n\nThe monument is the result of at least two phases of building.\n\n\n\n#### Cairn 1, before 4500 BC[edit]\n\n\nIn a first phase, a slightly trapezoidal mound of 32 m by 9 to 13 m was erected. It contained 5 chambers and was surrounded by a double kerb. The first phase favoured the use of dolerite.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Cairn 2, c. 4200 \u2013 c. 3900 BC[edit]\n\n\nIn a second phase, an extension with six further chambers was added in the west. At the same time, Cairn 1 was enveloped in a wider and taller structure; its passages had to be extended. More granite was used in this phase.[5]\n\n\n\n### The chambers[edit]\n\n\nThe 11 chambers of the Barnenez cairn are of the type known as *Dolmen \u00e0 couloir* in French archaeological terminology. The term translates roughly as \"passage grave\". They are built of large slabs of slate and granite. Originally, all the chambers were entirely enclosed by the mound. The fact that several of them are partially exposed now is the result of modern quarrying.\n\n\nEach of the 11 chambers is reached from the southeast via a long narrow passage (7\u201312 m long). They are arranged parallel to each other. Shapes and construction techniques differ slightly.\n\n\nIn nine cases, narrow passages lead to corbelled chambers. Normally, the corbel vault rests on orthostats, in one chamber it actually sits on the ground, forming a true *tholos*. The passages have slab-built or dry stone walls and are covered with slabs. One of the chambers has a dry-stone vaulted ante-chamber.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Examples of the carved symbols\n### Logistics[edit]\n\n\nOne cubic metre of the Barnenez cairn contains 1,500\u00a0kg of stone. It is estimated that the quarrying, fashioning, transport and construction of such an amount represents about four work days for a single worker (assuming a 10-hour day). The original monument, Cairn 1, had a volume of about 2,000 cubic metres; it is built of 1,000 tons of granite and 3,000 tons of dolerite. It would thus have required 15,000 to 20,000 working days; in other words, it would have taken 200 workers three months to erect Cairn 1 alone. In its final form, the Barnenez mound is nearly three times as big as the first phase.\n\n\n\n![](image)Reproduction of the \"Dolmen Goddess\" of Barnenez\n### Engraved symbols[edit]\n\n\nEngraved symbols occur in several of the chambers and passages. They depict bows, axes, wave symbols or snakes and a repeated U-shaped sign. One of the carved slabs is in secondary use; it was originally part of a different structure, an interesting parallel to the situation in several other such monuments, including Gavrinis.\n\n\nThe symbols on the engraved blocks resemble those found in other megalithic monuments in Brittany; in broader terms they belong to the cultural phenomenon described as megalithic art. One of the recurring symbols is sometimes interpreted as an anthropomorphic depiction (the so-called \"Dolmen Goddess\").\n\n\n\n### Finds[edit]\n\n\n#### Material from the original period of use[edit]\n\n\nOnly Cairn 2, namely chambers A, C and D, contained Neolithic finds at the time of excavation. They included pottery, polished stone axes (of dolerite), flint blades and arrowheads.\n\n\n\n#### Bronze Age pottery[edit]\n\n\nPottery shards found outside the monument indicate that it was reused in the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC). A copper dagger and a barbed arrowhead are of Chalcolithic date.[7]\n\n\n\n## Comparable monuments[edit]\n\n\nSimilar, possibly contemporary, monuments are known at 22 other locations in France and on Jersey. Breton examples are Larcuste-Colpo, Le Bono, Petit Mont, Ty-Floc\u00b4h, Gavrinis, \u00cele Carn, Ploudalm\u00e9zeau and Guennoc (I\u00b4ile Gaignoc \u2013 sometimes spelt Gu\u00e9nioc) off the shore at Land\u00e9da. Those located on islands are generally better preserved. Chamber 3 B at Guennoc contains a small standing stone near the entrance.\n\n\n\n## Exhibition[edit]\n\n\nAn exhibition in the modern entrance building explains the results of scientific excavation and displays some objects from the site.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Megalithic art\n* Gavrinis\n* Bougon\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The world's 10 oldest ruins\". *The Telegraph*. 4 February 2016.
