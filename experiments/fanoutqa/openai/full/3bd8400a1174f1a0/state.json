Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\"[4] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[5][6]\n\n\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number.

There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number. Additionally, the progression of U.S. presidents is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Law of the United States\n* List of courts of the United States\n* List of supreme courts by country\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Stathis, Stephen W.

Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an attorney.[1]\n\n\nBefore the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \"reading law\" (studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first Justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.[2]\n\n\nAssociate Justice James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, was the last Justice without a law degree to be appointed; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting Justice from such a background. In total, of the 114 justices appointed to the Court, 49 have had law degrees, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not receive a degree, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.[2]\n\n\nCurrently serving justices are listed in **bold** below.\n\n\n\n\n## Four or more justices[edit]\n\n\n* Harvard Law School \u2013 22 alumni; 18 graduates\n\t1.

Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an attorney.[1]\n\n\nBefore the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \"reading law\" (studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first Justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.[2]\n\n\nAssociate Justice James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, was the last Justice without a law degree to be appointed; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting Justice from such a background. In total, of the 114 justices appointed to the Court, 49 have had law degrees, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not receive a degree, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.[2]\n\n\nCurrently serving justices are listed in **bold** below.\n\n\n\n\n## Four or more justices[edit]\n\n\n* Harvard Law School \u2013 22 alumni; 18 graduates\n\t1.

Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\"[4] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[5][6]\n\n\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number.

Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\"[4] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[5][6]\n\n\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Justice\n | State[c] | Position\n | Succeeded\n | Date confirmed(Vote)\n | Tenure\n | Tenure length[d] | Nominated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | John Jay(1745\u20131829) | NY | ChiefJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 19, 1789\u2013June 29, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 253\u00a0days\n | George Washington |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | John Rutledge(1739\u20131800) | SC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 15, 1790[e]\u2013March 5, 1791(Resigned) | 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | William Cushing(1732\u20131810) | MA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013September 13, 1810(Died) | 20\u00a0years, 223\u00a0days\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | James Wilson(1742\u20131798) | PA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 5, 1789[e]\u2013August 21, 1798(Died) | 8\u00a0years, 320\u00a0days\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Blair(1732\u20131800) | VA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013October 25, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 265\u00a0days\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | James Iredell(1751\u20131799) | NC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | February 10, 1790(Acclamation)\n | May 12, 1790\u2013October 20, 1799(Died) | 9\u00a0years, 161\u00a0days\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Thomas Johnson(1732\u20131819) | MD | AssociateJustice | J.

There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2017, and has served since April 10, 2017.\n\n\nGorsuch spent his early life in Denver, Colorado, then lived in Bethesda, Maryland, while attending Georgetown Preparatory School. Upon graduating, he matriculated at Columbia University, where he became an established writer. Gorsuch received his legal education at Harvard Law School and in 1993, after 15 years as a practicing attorney, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in jurisprudence from the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship. His doctoral thesis concerned the morality of assisted suicide and was written under the supervision of legal philosopher John Finnis.\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch was in private practice with the law firm of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. He was the principal deputy associate attorney general at the United States Department of Justice from 2005 until his appointment to the Tenth Circuit. President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 10, 2006, to replace Judge David M. Ebel, who achieved senior status that same year.\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in interpreting the United States Constitution.[2][3][4] Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, he is an advocate of natural law jurisprudence.[5] Gorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992 and U.S. Supreme Court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994. He is the first Supreme Court justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he once clerked (Kennedy).[6] During his tenure on the Supreme Court he has written the majority opinion in landmark cases such as *Bostock v. Clayton County* on LGBT rights, *McGirt v. Oklahoma* on Native American law, *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* on personal religious observance, *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* on free speech, and *Ramos v. Louisiana* on juries' guilty verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was born on August 29, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, to Anne Gorsuch Burford (n\u00e9e McGill; 1942\u20132004) and David Ronald Gorsuch (1937\u20132001).[7][8] He was the eldest of three children,[9] and is a fourth-generation Coloradan.[10] Both of Gorsuch's parents were lawyers, and his mother served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980. In 1981, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[11][12]\n\n\nAfter his mother's appointment, Gorsuch's family moved to Bethesda, Maryland. He enrolled in Georgetown Preparatory School,[13] a selective Jesuit college-preparatory school, arriving as a freshman in 1981.[14] He was two years junior to future justice Brett Kavanaugh, a classmate he later clerked with at the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a member of Georgetown Prep's debate, forensics, and international relations clubs,[15] and served as a United States Senate page in the early 1980s.[16] He graduated in 1985 as student body president; in contrast to Kavanaugh, he was described as a fairly outgoing and extroverted student.[15][17]\n\n\nGorsuch attended Columbia University after high school, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in political science. He undertook a heavier courseload to graduate in three years.[18] As an undergraduate, he wrote for the *Columbia Daily Spectator*[19] and co-founded the satirical student publication *The Fed* in 1986.[20][21] Gorsuch distinguished himself as an active debater and an ardent conservative, publishing pieces that criticized left-wing politics. After a brief stint as a writer for a short-lived journal, he led efforts to establish *The Fed* as a conservative alternative to liberal campus newspapers.[18] He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity[22] and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.[23][18][24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School on a Harry S. Truman Scholarship.[25][26] At Harvard, he had been an editor of the *Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy*[27][23] and was a member of the Lincoln's Inn Society, the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project, and the Harvard Defenders program.[28][29] Gorsuch was described as a committed conservative who supported the Gulf War and congressional term limits on \"a campus full of ardent liberals\".[30] Despite his contrasting political views, he was generally well-liked by students.[31] Philip C. Berg, a classmate and close friend, remembered him as \"very sensitive\" and non-confrontational, recalling when he received Gorsuch's support in coming out.[28] Gorsuch graduated in 1991 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*. Future President Barack Obama was among his classmates.[32]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as a law clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992. After spending a year at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Gorsuch clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994.[23][26][33] His work with White occurred right after White retired from the Supreme Court; therefore, Gorsuch assisted White with his work on the Tenth Circuit, where White sat by designation.[23] Gorsuch was part of a group of five law clerks assigned that year that included Brett Kavanaugh, who described Gorsuch at the time, saying: \"He fit into the place very easily. He's just an easy guy to get along with. He doesn't have sharp elbows. We had a wide range of views, but we all really got along well.\"[34]\n\n\n\n### Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nInstead of joining an established law firm, Gorsuch decided to join the two-year-old boutique firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (now Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick), where he focused on trial work.[12] After winning his first trial as lead attorney, a jury member told Gorsuch he was like Perry Mason.[12] He was an associate in the Washington, D.C., law firm from 1995 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2005.[23][35] Gorsuch's clients included Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz.[36] At Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch focused on commercial matters, including contracts, antitrust, RICO, and securities fraud.[23]\n\n\nIn 2002, Gorsuch wrote an op-ed criticizing the Senate for delaying the nominations of Merrick Garland and John Roberts to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, writing, \"the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated\" by the Senate.[37]\n\n\nIn 2004, Gorsuch received a Doctor of Philosophy in legal philosophy from the University of Oxford, where he completed research on assisted suicide and euthanasia as a postgraduate student at University College.[38][27][23] A Marshall Scholarship enabled him to study at Oxford in 1992\u201393, where he was supervised by the natural law philosopher John Finnis.[39] His thesis was also supervised by Canadian legal scholar Timothy Endicott of Balliol College, Oxford.[38][40] In 1996, Gorsuch married Louise, an Englishwoman and champion equestrienne on Oxford's riding team whom he met during his stay there.[12][41]\n\n\nIn 2005, at Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch wrote a brief denouncing class action lawsuits by attorneys on behalf of shareholders. In the case of *Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo*, Gorsuch opined, \"The free ride to fast riches enjoyed by securities class action attorneys in recent years appeared to hit a speed bump\" and \"the problem is that securities fraud litigation imposes an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing businesses billions of dollars in settlements every year\".[35]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Department of Justice[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum, at the United States Department of Justice from June 2005 until July 2006.[23][42] As McCallum's principal deputy, he assisted in managing the Department of Justice's civil litigation components, which included the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment, and tax divisions.[23]\n\n\nWhile managing the United States Department of Justice Civil Division, Gorsuch was tasked with all the \"terror litigation\" arising from the president's War on Terror, successfully defending the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri, fighting the disclosure of Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photographs, and, in November 2005, traveling to inspect the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[43]\n\n\nGorsuch helped Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepare for hearings after the public revelation of NSA warrantless surveillance (2001\u201307), and worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in drafting the provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act that attempted to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees.[44]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006\u20132017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nIn January 2006, Philip Anschutz recommended Gorsuch's nomination to Colorado's U.S. senator Wayne Allard and White House Counsel Harriet Miers.[36] On May 10, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by Judge David M. Ebel, who was taking senior status.[27] Like Ebel, Gorsuch was a former clerk of Justice White. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \"well qualified\" in 2006.[23][45][46]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2006, Gorsuch was confirmed by unanimous voice vote in the U.S. Senate.[47][48] He was Bush's fifth appointment to the Tenth Circuit.[49] When Gorsuch began his tenure at Denver's Byron White United States Courthouse, Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office.[37]\n\n\nDuring his time on the Tenth Circuit, ten of Gorsuch's law clerks went on to become Supreme Court clerks, and he was sometimes regarded as a \"feeder judge\".[50] One of his former clerks, Jonathan Papik, became an associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 2018.[51]\n\n\n\n### Freedom of religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch advocates a broad definition of religious freedom that is inimical to church\u2013state separation advocates.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn *Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius* (2013), Gorsuch wrote a concurrence when the *en banc* circuit found the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate on a private business violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.[55] That ruling was upheld 5\u20134 by the Supreme Court in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.* (2014).[56] When a panel of the court denied similar claims under the same act in *Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell* (2015), Gorsuch joined Judges Harris Hartz, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., Timothy Tymkovich, and Jerome Holmes in their dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[57] That ruling was vacated and remanded to the Tenth Circuit by the *per curiam* Supreme Court in *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016).[56]\n\n\nIn *Pleasant Grove City v. Summum* (2007), he joined Judge Michael W. McConnell's dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*, taking the view that the government's display of a donated Ten Commandments monument in a public park did not obligate the government to display other offered monuments.[58] The Supreme Court subsequently adopted most of the dissent's view, reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment.[56] Gorsuch has written, \"the law [...] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Administrative law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has called for reconsideration of *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.* (1984), in which the Supreme Court instructed courts to grant deference to federal agencies' interpretation of ambiguous laws and regulations. In *Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that court review was required before an executive agency could reject the circuit court's interpretation of an immigration law.[60][61]\n\n\nAlone, Gorsuch added a concurring opinion, criticizing *Chevron* deference and *National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services* (2005) as an \"abdication of judicial duty\" and writing that deference is \"more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\".[62][63]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Hinckley* (2008), Gorsuch argued that one possible reading of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act likely violates the nondelegation doctrine.[64] Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had held the same view in their 2012 dissent in *Reynolds v. United States*.[65]\n\n\n\n### Interstate commerce[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been an opponent of the dormant Commerce Clause, which allows state laws to be declared unconstitutional if they too greatly burden interstate commerce. In 2011, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that the dormant Commerce Clause did not prevent the Oklahoma Water Resources Board from blocking water exports to Texas.[66] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann* (2013).[67]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that federal courts could not hear a challenge to Colorado's internet sales tax.[68] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed that ruling in *Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl* (2015).[67] In 2016, the Tenth Circuit panel rejected the challenger's dormant commerce clause claim, with Gorsuch writing a concurrence.[69]\n\n\nIn *Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Joshua Epel* (2015), Gorsuch held that Colorado's mandates for renewable energy did not violate the commerce clause by putting out-of-state coal companies at a disadvantage.[70] He wrote that the Colorado renewable energy law \"isn't a price-control statute, it doesn't link prices paid in Colorado with those paid out of state, and it does not discriminate against out-of-staters\".[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nIn *Riddle v. Hickenlooper* (2014), Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in finding that it was unconstitutional for a Colorado law to set the limit on donations for write-in candidates at half the amount for major party candidates.[73] He added a concurrence noting that although the standard of review of campaign finance in the United States is unclear, the Colorado law would fail even under intermediate scrutiny.[74]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Planned Parenthood v. Herbert* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for the four dissenting judges when the Tenth Circuit denied a full rehearing of a divided panel opinion that had ordered the Utah governor to resume the organization's funding, which Herbert had blocked in response to a video controversy.[75][76]\n\n\nIn *A.M. v. Holmes* (2016), the Tenth Circuit considered a case in which a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a New Mexico statute that makes it a misdemeanor to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal \u00a7\u00a01983 civil rights action against school officials and the school resource officer who made the arrest, arguing that it was a false arrest that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit.[77] Gorsuch wrote a four-page dissent, arguing that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had \"long ago alerted law enforcement\" that the statute that the officer relied upon for the child's arrest does not criminalize noises or diversions that merely disturb order in a classroom.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n### Criminal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that a court may still order criminals to pay restitution even after it missed a statutory deadline.[80] The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling 5\u20134 in *Dolan v. United States* (2010).[67]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Games-Perez* (2012), Gorsuch ruled on a case where a felon owned a gun in violation of 18\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0922(g)(1), but alleged that he did not know that he was a felon at the time. Gorsuch joined the majority in upholding the conviction based on Tenth Circuit precedent, but filed a concurring opinion arguing that said precedent was wrongly decided: \"The only statutory element separating innocent (even constitutionally protected) gun possession from criminal conduct in \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(a) is a prior felony conviction. So the presumption that the government must prove mens rea here applies with full force.\"[81] In the 2019 case *Rehaif v. United States*, the Supreme Court overruled this decision, with Gorsuch joining.\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that intent does not need to be proven under a bank fraud statute.[82] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Loughrin v. United States* (2014).[67] In 2015, Gorsuch wrote a dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc* when the Tenth Circuit found that a convicted sex offender had to register with Kansas after he moved to the Philippines.[83] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit in *Nichols v. United States* (2016).[67]\n\n\n\n### Death penalty[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch favors a strict reading of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).[56] In 2015, he wrote for the court when it permitted Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to order the execution of Scott Eizember, prompting a 30-page dissent by Judge Mary Beck Briscoe.[84][85] After the state's unsuccessful execution of Clayton Lockett, Gorsuch joined Briscoe when the court unanimously allowed Pruitt to continue using the same lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling 5\u20134 in *Glossip v. Gross* (2015).[86]\n\n\n\n### List of judicial opinions[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Gorsuch authored 212 published opinions.[87] Some of those are:\n\n\n\n* *United States v. Hinckley*, 550 F. 3d 926 (2008), on principles of interpretation and construction of a statute, according to plain meaning and context\n* *United States v.

Obama had nominated Garland on March 16, 2016, but Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley did not schedule a hearing for him, leaving Garland's nomination to expire on January 3, 2017.[93] Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \"Biden Rule\" (of 1992) to justify the Senate's refusal to consider Garland's nomination in a general election year.[94][95][96]\n\n\nTrump formally transmitted his nomination to the Senate on February 1, 2017.[97] The American Bar Association unanimously gave Gorsuch its top rating\u2014\"Well Qualified\"\u2014to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.[98] His confirmation hearing before the Senate started on March 20, 2017.[99]\n\n\nOn April 3, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination with a party-line 11\u20139 vote.[100] On April 6, 2017, Democrats filibustered (prevented cloture) the confirmation vote, after which Republicans invoked the \"nuclear option\", allowing a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee to be broken by a simple majority vote.[101]\n\n\nOn April 4, BuzzFeed and *Politico* ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia* and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, Indiana's deputy attorney general. Academic experts contacted by *Politico* \"differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness.\"[102][103][104][105]\n\n\nJohn Finnis, who supervised Gorsuch's dissertation at Oxford, said, \"The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly, absurd.\" Kuzma said, \"I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar. These passages are factual, not analytical in nature, framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the 'Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in 1982.\"[103] In his book on Gorsuch, John Greenya described how Gorsuch was challenged during his confirmation hearings concerning some of his dissertation advisor's more strident views, which Gorsuch generally disagreed with.[106]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court by a 54\u201345 vote, with three Democrats (Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly) joining all Republicans in attendance.[107]\n\n\nGorsuch received his commission on April 8, 2017.[108] He was sworn into office on Monday, April 10, 2017, in two ceremonies. The chief justice of the United States administered the constitutional oath of office in a private ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Supreme Court, making Gorsuch the 101st associate justice of the Court. At 11 a.m., Justice Kennedy administered the judicial oath of office in a public ceremony at the White House Rose Garden.[109][110][111]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2017\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### Banking regulation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote his first U.S. Supreme Court decision for a unanimous court in *Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.*, 582 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017). The Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander in this case was not a debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since it purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent.[112] When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch joined the majority in *National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra* and *Janus v. AFSCME*, which both held unconstitutional certain forms of compelled speech.[115][116]\n\n\nGorsuch authored the majority opinion in *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* (2022), which concerned a public high school football coach who was fired for praying on the field after games. The opinion held that the coach's conduct was protected by both the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment, and that the school's attempt to stop him was not mandated by the amendment's Establishment Clause.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, in *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to deny same-sex married parents the same right to appear on the birth certificate.[118] Gorsuch wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Alito, arguing that the Court should have fully heard the arguments of the case.[119]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in the combined cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, *Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda*, and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission*, ruling that businesses cannot discriminate in employment against LGBTQ people. He argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal discrimination on the basis of sex, because the employer would be discriminating \"for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex\".[120] The ruling was 6\u20133, with Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court's four Democratic appointees.[121][122] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh dissented from the decision, arguing that it improperly extended the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity.[123]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Gorsuch agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[124] In June 2021, he joined the justices in the unanimous Fulton v. City of Philadelphia decision, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption agency that had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia due to the agency's refusal to adopt to same-sex couples.[125] Gorsuch and Thomas joined Alito's concurrence, which argued for reconsidering, possibly overturning, *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[126] Also in 2021, Gorsuch was one of three justices, with Thomas and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington State florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[127][128][129] In November 2021, Gorsuch dissented from the Court's 6\u20133 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[130] The decision to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor; Thomas and Alito also dissented.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2019\nGorsuch joined Thomas's dissent from denial of certiorari in *Peruta v. San Diego County*, in which the Ninth Circuit had upheld California's restrictive concealed carry laws.[133]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of an application for a stay presented to Roberts in *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives*, a 2019 D.C. Circuit case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. In his statement Gorsuch criticized the Trump Administration's action as well as the justification the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit used for upholding the ban.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Vagueness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nIn *Sessions v. Dimaya* (2018), the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision that the residual clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act was unconstitutionally vague. Gorsuch joined Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the opinion, and wrote a separate concurrence reiterating the importance of the vagueness doctrine within Scalia's 2015 opinion in *Johnson*.[136] In *United States v. Davis* (2019), Gorsuch wrote the Opinion of the Court striking down the residual clause of the Hobbs Act based on the rationale used in *Dimaya*.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Gorsuch dissented when the Court voted against hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[139] He and Alito joined Thomas's dissent arguing that it was the Court's job to hear the case.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Gorsuch sided with three of the Court's other conservative justices, rejecting a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[141] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5\u20134 decision, would require that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[142] In June 2020, the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's abortion restriction in *June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo*, a 5\u20134 decision; Gorsuch was among the four dissenters.[143][144] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined a petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks; the vote was 5\u20134 with Gorsuch in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.[145]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Gorsuch was among the five justices who formed the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, overruling *Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[146]\n\n\n\n### Native American law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is regarded as an authority on American Indian law.[147] During his time on the Supreme Court, he has frequently affirmed tribal rights; his appointment to the Court was supported by multiple tribes and Native American organizations due to his favorable rulings as a Tenth Circuit judge.[148][149]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices (in two plurality opinions) in a 5\u20134 majority in *Washington State Dept. of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.*[150] The Court's decision sided with the Yakama Nation, striking down a Washington state tax on transporting gasoline, on the basis of an 1855 treaty in which the Yakama ceded a large portion of Washington in exchange for certain rights.[151] In his concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Gorsuch ended his opinion by writing: \"Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The state is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.\"[152]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Gorsuch again joined the four more liberal justices in a decision favorable to Native Americans' treaty rights, signing on to Justice Sotomayor's opinion to reach a 5\u20134 decision in *Herrera v. Wyoming*. The case held that hunting rights in Montana and Wyoming, granted by the U.S. government to the Native American Crow people by an 1868 treaty, were not extinguished by the 1890 grant of statehood to Wyoming.[153]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Gorsuch again joined the liberal justices to make a 5\u20134 majority in *McGirt v. Oklahoma*. The case considered whether much of eastern Oklahoma still remained under the jurisdiction of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", given that the Native American Treaties that had designated the region as under their reservation status had never been dissolved by Congress, and, if so, whether crimes committed by Native Americans against other Native Americans on tribal land were under the jurisdiction of Native Courts.[154] The landmark decision in the affirmative, written by Gorsuch, found that \"For Major Crimes Act purposes, land reserved for the Creek Nation since the 19th century remains 'Indian country.'\"[155][156] In the opinion, he wrote: \"Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.\"[156] The case was later reviewed in the June 2022 case Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, which considered whether non-Natives who committed crimes against Natives on Native American territory can be charged under the sole jurisdiction of Native American tribal courts.[157][158] While the state of Oklahoma had initially argued for the overturning of *McGirt*, the Court agreed to hear only issues relating to the impacts of *McGirt*.[159] The 5-4 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh opposed the more expanded viewpoint of non-Native criminal jurisdiction, with the opinion giving jurisdiction over such crimes to both tribal and federal/state governments. Gorsuch derided the opinion in his dissent, writing, \"Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.\"[160][161]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Gorsuch, Barrett, and the three liberal justices ruled in favor of the Native American Tribes of Texas in the case *Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas*. The case concerned a dispute over whether Texas could control and regulate gambling on Texan Native American reservations. The initial conflict had developed from the tribes' having been in a trust with Texas from 1968 to 1987 before being granted a federal trust, resulting in a statute governing the tribes' subjugation to Texas's gambling restrictions.[162] The ruling emphasized that the tribes have the power to regulate electronic bingo games on their land regardless of the state's prohibition of non-prohibited gambling. Thus, as long as a game is not outright prohibited by the state of Texas, the state government cannot impose regulations upon tribal games. Gorsuch emphasized in his opinion that \"None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever terms it wishes [...] Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law.\"[163]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 restrictions[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Gorsuch joined the majority opinion in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, which struck down COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the state of New York on houses of worship.[164]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2023, Gorsuch issued a statement about the Court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit by several states aimed at continuing Title 42 expulsions of immigrants, a policy instituted to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 cases to the United States. His statement criticized many of the restrictions the government had imposed since the pandemic started and said, \"Since March 2020, we may have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country.\"[165]\n\n\n\n## Legal philosophy[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of originalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment, and of textualism, the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.[2][3][4] An editorial in the *National Catholic Register* opined that Gorsuch's judicial decisions lean more toward natural law philosophy.[166]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Gorsuch and Sotomayor \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[167]\n\n\n\n### Voting alignment[edit]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight used Lee Epstein et al.'s Judicial Common Space scores[168] (which are not based on a judge's behavior, but rather the ideology scores of either home state senators or the appointing president) to find a close alignment between the conservatism of other appellate and Supreme Court judges such as Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.[169] *The Washington Post*'s statistical analysis estimated that the ideologies of most of Trump's announced candidates were \"statistically indistinguishable\" and also associated Gorsuch with Kavanaugh and Alito.[170]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch in 2019\nIn a 2016 speech at Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be\u2014not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.[171]\n\n\nIn a 2005 *National Review* article, Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\" and that they are \"failing to reach out and persuade the public\". He wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' \"overweening addiction\" to using the courts for social debate is \"bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary\".[47][172]\n\n\n\n### Federalism and state power[edit]\n\n\nJustin Marceau, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, called Gorsuch \"a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power\". Marceau added that this is important because federal laws have been used to try to reel in \"rogue\" state laws in civil rights cases.[173]\n\n\n\n### Assisted suicide[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2006, Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, developed from his doctoral thesis, was published by Princeton University Press.[38][174][175][176] In the book, Gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide, arguing that the U.S. should \"retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.\"[59][175][177]\n\n\n\n### Statutory interpretation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been considered to follow in Scalia's footsteps as a textualist in statutory interpretation of the plain meaning of the law.[178][179] This was exemplified in his majority opinion in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020), which ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 grants protection from employment discrimination due to sexual orientation and gender identity. Gorsuch wrote in the decision, \"An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\"[180][181][182]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch and family with Donald Trump, Anthony Kennedy, and Mike Pence prior to his swearing-in\nGorsuch and his wife, Marie Louise Gorsuch,[183] a British citizen, met at Oxford. The two married at St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Henley-on-Thames in 1996.[184][185] They live in Boulder, Colorado, and have two daughters.[186][187][188]\n\n\nGorsuch enjoys the outdoors and fly fishing; he went fly fishing on at least one occasion with Justice Scalia.[10][189] He raises horses, chickens, and goats, and often arranges ski trips with colleagues and friends.[56]\n\n\nHe has authored two nonfiction books. The first, *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, was published by Princeton University Press in July 2006.[190] He is a co-author of *The Law of Judicial Precedent*, published by Thomson West in 2016.[35]\n\n\nIn 2017, after his announcement as a Supreme Court nominee, *the New York Times* reported that Gorsuch owned a timeshare outside Granby, Colorado, with associates of Philip Anschutz, that was later sold the same year.[36] Reporting from *Politico* in April 2023 revealed that Gorsuch had sold the cabin to Brian Duffy, the CEO of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which litigates cases before the Supreme Court, but failed to disclose the purchaser's identity on his federal disclosure forms.[191] The property was listed for sale for a few years but did not go under contract until the week after Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court.[191][192] Since 2017, Greenberg Traurig has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the Supreme Court.[191][193]\n\n\nGorsuch has been active in several professional associations throughout his legal career,[23] including the American Bar Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, Phi Beta Kappa, the Republican National Lawyers Association, and the New York, Colorado, and District of Columbia Bar Associations.[23] In May 2019, it was announced that Gorsuch would become the new chairman of the board of the National Constitution Center, succeeding former vice president Joe Biden.[194]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the Supreme Court since the retirement of John Paul Stevens in 2010.[195][196][197] He and his two siblings were raised Catholic and attended weekly Mass.[198][186] His wife, Louise, is British-born; the two met while Neil was studying at Oxford. Louise was raised in the Church of England.[199]\n\n\nWhen the couple returned to the United States they joined Holy Comforter, an Episcopal parish in Vienna, Virginia, attending weekly services. Gorsuch volunteered there as an usher.[197] The Gorsuch family later attended St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado, a liberal church with a longstanding open-door policy for the LGBT community.[91][200][201] During his 2017 confirmation hearing, responding to a senator's question about his faith, Gorsuch replied, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, senator.\"[202][203][204] After marrying in a non-Catholic ceremony and joining an Episcopal church, Gorsuch has not publicly clarified his religious affiliation.[199]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service to the Department of Justice and the Harry S. Truman Foundation's Stevens Award for outstanding public service in the field of law.[188]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Gorsuch, Neil (2004). *The right to receive assistance in suicide and euthanasia, with particular reference to the law of the United States* (DPhil thesis).

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\nKavanaugh studied history at Yale University, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Yale Law School, after which he began his career as a law clerk working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become the head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including drafting the *Starr Report* recommending Clinton's impeachment. He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious and stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006.[2][4][5]\n\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11\u201310 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50\u201348.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[19] the son of Martha Gamble (*n\u00e9e* Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[20][21] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Roscommon, Ireland, in the late 19th century,[22][23] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[22] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[24] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[25][26]\n\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n## Legal career (1990\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (second from left) with President George W. Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\nAfter working as a summer associate for the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr, from 1992 to 1993.[42][43][44] He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994,[42] alongside Neil Gorsuch and with future federal judge Gary Feinerman.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ken Starr associate counsel[edit]\n\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\nAfter working in private practice in 1997\u201398, Kavanaugh rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In *Swidler & Berlin v. United States* (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the Court to disregard attorney\u2013client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6\u20133.[51]\n\n\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the *Starr Report*, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton\u2013Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail the authors called \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Kavanaugh rejoined Kirkland & Ellis in 1999 and eventually became a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was *pro bono* counsel of record for relatives of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, his relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate Gonz\u00e1lez to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the repatriation.[60]\n\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Circuit Judge (2006\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh is sworn into the D.C. Circuit by Justice Anthony Kennedy as his wife holds the bible and President Bush looks on, 2006. Coincidentally, Kavanaugh would be sworn into the U.S. Supreme Court 12 years later as Kennedy's replacement.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10\u20138 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[69] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57\u201336.[70][71] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[72] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[73]\n\n\nIn July 2007, senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[74][75] The issue reemerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[76]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nOn the 14 occasions on which Kavanaugh authored opinions that were considered by the Supreme Court, the Court adopted his position 13 times and reversed his position once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][77] He was regarded as a feeder judge.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the October 2017 decision *Garza v. Hargan*, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before traveling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously\".[79][80] Days later, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[80][81] In his dissent, he criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[82] The girl then obtained an abortion.[80] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the *en banc* D.C. Circuit's judgment and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot and does not serve as precedent.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[84][85] In his dissent, he compared the individual mandate to a tax. After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in *Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services* (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a long dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[86][87] In May 2015, he dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of *Priests for Life v. HHS*, in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Appointments Clause and separation of powers[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the president.[91][92] In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5\u20134.[93]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, he wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB director removable by the president of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7\u20133, over Kavanaugh's dissent.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of *mandamus* requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum, an orca.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6\u20132 in *EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P.* (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in *Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency* (2014).[106][107] After Kavanaugh dissented from a *per curiam* decision allowing the agency to disregard cost\u2013benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in *Michigan v. EPA* (2015).[108][109]\n\n\n\n#### Extraterritorial jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.* (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] He dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[77][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment and free speech[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] The Supreme Court summarily affirmed both those judgments on direct appeal.[116]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In *United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC* (2016), he dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule.\"[43][119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment and civil liberties[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The Supreme Court then affirmed the circuit's judgment in *United States v. Jones* (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment in *District of Columbia v. Wesby* (2018).[125]\n\n\nIn *Klayman v. Obama* (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an *en banc* rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata,[126][127] writing that the metadata collection was not a search, and even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh holds his daughter while greeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush.\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a long concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advance notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In *Kiyemba v. Obama* (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, he concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided the existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the *en banc* circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes.[139][140]\n\n\nIn *Meshal v. Higgenbotham* (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment and gun ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008).[143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Vaccine regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in *Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius*,[145] holding that opponents of thimerosal-preserved vaccines lacked standing to challenge determinations by the Food and Drug Administration that vaccines and their components are safe and effective. SCOTUSblog provided the case as an example of the fact that \"[e]ven when Kavanaugh rejects a claim, he sometimes uses his discussion of standing to show that he has heard the plaintiff's argument and taken it seriously\".[146] Bloomberg wrote, \"Kavanaugh's opinion for the court repeatedly went out of its way to show it respected the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs's (CoMeD) 'genuine concern' regarding thimerosal\", but nevertheless \"said the coalition was required to seek a ban through the executive or legislative branches\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Law clerk hiring practices[edit]\n\n\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's 48 law clerks have been women, and 13 people of color.[148] Some have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff).[149][150]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, *The Guardian* reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Rubenfeld said that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\" but did not say what that \"look\" was.[151] Unnamed sources reported that Chua said that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in job interviews with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[151] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[152] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction.

Wade*, which ruled abortion bans unconstitutional, and *Furman v. Georgia*, which ruled all existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional.[160][161] Two law professors evaluated Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions for the *Washington Post,* rating his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Circuit in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[162]\n\n\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had often said the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history were *Brown v. Board of Education*, *Marbury v. Madison*, *Youngstown Steel*, and *United States v. Nixon*, with *Brown* the single greatest.[163]\n\n\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas was the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were delayed at the onset by objections from the Democratic members about the absence of records of Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received only the night before the first day of hearings.[166] Republicans asserted that the volume of documents available on Kavanaugh equaled that of the previous five nominees to the court; the Democrats responded that only 15% of the documents they had requested about Kavanaugh had been provided. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question-and-answer periods to begin the next day.[167]\n\n\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the Court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of preexisting healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, *Roe v. Wade*, or the president's power to self-pardon. He expounded at length on various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the president's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the previous session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections by Democrats.[168]\n\n\nThe committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails by Kavanaugh related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing to answer direct questions about matters he called hypothetical.[169] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to *The Intercept*, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from Kozinski, Kavanaugh replied, \"I do not remember\".[170] During his testimony, Kavanaugh said that Kozinski's 2017 exposure as an alleged prolific sexual harasser was a surprising \"gut punch\". *The Guardian* reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judicial system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[171]\n\n\n\nThe committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [*Roe v. Wade*] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the Court would do so.\"[172] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since 2003.[173] Senator Susan Collins indicated that Kavanaugh's statement did not contradict his personal assurance to her that *Roe* is settled law.[174] Kavanaugh noted that *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, *Casey* is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[175]\n\n\nOn September 27, the committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, his accuser.[176] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[177] Grassley cut her questioning short, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[178][179] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh.[180] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, both \"visibly drunk\", had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \"believed he was going to rape me\" and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[181][182][183] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack, has denied that it took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[184] In response to his testimony, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault allegations[edit]\n\n\n#### Christine Blasey Ford[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a *Washington Post* tipline and her U.S. Representative, Anna Eshoo, with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.[7][186] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to Senator Dianne Feinstein to inform her of her accusation against Kavanaugh,[187] requesting that it be kept confidential.[188] After a September 12 report in *The Intercept*,[7][186][189] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein said that the woman had claimed that, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had tried to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[190][191] The same day, Feinstein said she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[192][193]\n\n\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[194][195] She said that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[196] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[197] and believed he was going to rape her.[198] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[194][199]\n\n\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[193][192] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay his confirmation hearings.[200][201] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before his and Ford's scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[202]\n\n\nOn September 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 19.[203] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the committee whether she intended to testify. He added that Ford was welcome to appear before the committee privately or publicly.[204] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[205] A bipartisan Judiciary Committee panel and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[206]\n\n\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party or a sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[207] and Keyser told *The Washington Post* that she believed Ford's allegation.[208][209]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegation after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[210] Her attorneys tweeted, \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[211]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *New York Times* reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin published *The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation*. They reported that Keyser \"thought the whole setup Ford described ... sounded wrong\", and that she \"challenged Ford's accuracy\", quoting Keyser as saying, \"I don't have any confidence in the story\".[212] According to *The Washington Post*, the book revealed that \"Keyser also said she spoke with many people who 'wanted me to remember something different'\u2014suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line [against Kavanaugh]\".[213]\n\n\n\n#### Deborah Ramirez[edit]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of *The New Yorker* published an article with another sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983\u201384 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[214] *The New Yorker* spoke to four classmates, three identified as eyewitnesses but all denied witnessing the event.[214] *The New York Times* interviewed several dozen of Ramirez's classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[215] According to *The New York Times*, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[216] *The Washington Post* analyzed Ramirez's allegation and concluded, \"Ramirez's accusation has the dual distinction of having more potential corroboration and less actual corroboration than Ford's\".[217]\n\n\n\n#### Julie Swetnick[edit]\n\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti tweeted on September 23, 2018, that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" about Kavanaugh and Judge. Avenatti said his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[218][219][220] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee. In a sworn statement, Swetnick described attending \"well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981\u20131983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present\". She described witnessing efforts by Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Kavanaugh called her allegations \"ridiculous\" and Avenatti's allegation as a whole a \"farce\".[10] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends had come forward publicly to support her claims.[221] In an interview with NBC News, Swetnick clarified that she did not personally witness Kavanaugh or Judge spike any drinks, and accused Avenatti of twisting her words. She further clarified that she did not personally witness efforts by Kavanaugh or Judge to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Swetnick provided NBC News with the names of friends who attended the parties, but none could corroborate her claims, while some said they did not know her.[222][223] Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that they engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[224]\n\n\n\n#### Judy Munro-Leighton[edit]\n\n\nOn September 19, Judy Munro-Leighton accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an anonymous letter signed \"Jane Doe\", which was addressed to Grassley but mailed to Senator Kamala Harris. On September 26, the Senate committee interrogated Kavanaugh about this accusation. Kavanaugh called the accusation \"ridiculous\".[11] On November 1, Munro-Leighton talked to committee staff members. During the conversation she changed her story, denying that she had penned the anonymous letter and saying she had contacted Congress as \"a ploy\" to \"get attention\".[225] On November 2, Grassley announced Munro-Leighton's identity, and described her accusations as fabricated.[11] She was referred to the Department of Justice and FBI for making false accusations and obstructing justice.[11]\n\n\n\n#### FBI investigation and ethics complaints[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[226] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on delaying the vote in the full Senate for a week to allow the FBI to investigate Ford's claims. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[227] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within a week.[228] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where senators were permitted to review the report one at a time in secrecy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[229] Democrats called the FBI investigation incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[230][231] According to *The Washington Post*, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[211]\n\n\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh regarding his conduct during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate them. In December 2018, the panel dismissed all the complaints, calling them \"serious\" but deciding that lower court judges have no authority to investigate Supreme Court justices.[232]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 *Justice* film[edit]\n\n\nDoug Liman's 2023 documentary *Justice* recounts the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, including the testimony of Ford and Ramirez. It features a never-before-heard audio recording made by Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier, a Yale colleague of Kavanaugh's, that corroborates Ramirez's charges and suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman. Stier says that he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down with a group of rowdy soccer players forcing a drunk female freshman to hold Kavanaugh's penis. Stier also says that he had heard from classmates about Ramirez's similar encounter with Kavanaugh, which she personally describes in the film.[233]\n\n\nThe documentary also highlights the narratives Kavanaugh advanced to sway public opinion and gain Republicans' support, which reviewers described as misleading. Reviewers were persuaded that Kavanaugh and his team were aware of Ford's and Ramirez's charges before they became public and preemptively countered them by planting alternate narratives with friends and acquaintances.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Senate action[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51\u201349 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[236] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[237][238]\n\n\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50\u201348 vote.[239] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at his daughter's wedding that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition so that their votes would cancel out and the balance of the vote would be retained\u2014a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[240] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and all Democrats except Joe Manchin voted not to.[241] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. The only Supreme Court confirmation that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by a single vote, 24\u201323; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[242][243][244] In *percentage* terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews's. Matthews received 51.06% of the vote to Kavanaugh's 51.02%.[245]\n\n\n\n### Swearing-in[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[246] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[15][247][248] Upon joining the Court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[249][250]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2018\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh being sworn in to succeed Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice on October 8, 2018\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for *Stokeling v. United States* and *United States v. Stitt*.[251]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Kavanaugh was reassigned to both the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.[252] He had previously been assigned to the Seventh Circuit, which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.[253] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions)[254] that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by the assigned justice alone or else by the justice's referring them to the full Court for review.\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote his first Supreme Court opinion on January 8, 2019, in *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, a unanimous decision reversing an appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[255]\n\n\nOn February 27, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's liberal justices in *Garza v. Idaho*, a case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[256]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four more liberal justices to decline to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues in voting to reject a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[258] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[259] *CNBC* reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[260] The Supreme Court decided this case, *June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo*, on June 29, 2020, striking down Louisiana's requirement for abortion providers to hold hospital admitting privileges. Kavanaugh dissented.[261] In September 2021, by a 5\u20134 vote, the Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Kavanaugh was in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett.[262] In June 2022, in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, Kavanaugh joined the same four justices in voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[263]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nAlso in February, Kavanaugh was part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, he was part of the majority in a 5\u20134 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay his execution in order to have an imam present.[264] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four liberal justices in a 6\u20133 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[265][266] In January 2022, he voted with the majority in a 5\u20134 decision to allow an execution to proceed in Alabama.[267] In 2023 Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in *Reed v. Goertz*, ruling that Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed could seek DNA testing on evidence in his case despite the state's statute of limitations on such testing.[268]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, the Supreme Court ruled 6\u20133 that the workplace nondiscrimination protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted as protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in which he argued that sexual orientation discrimination has always been understood as distinct from sex discrimination. He conceded that sexual orientation discrimination \"may, as a very literal matter, entail making a distinction based on sex\"; nonetheless, he said, \"to fire one employee because she is a woman and another employee because he is gay implicates two distinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes two distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory prohibitions.\" He said that any change to the relevant law ought to be made by Congress, not by judges; and that \"both the rule of law and democratic accountability badly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation of the law, and not its ordinary meaning.\"[269] Kavanaugh's dissent did not discuss gender identity or use the word \"transgender\", although transgender rights were at issue in the case. In a footnote, he wrote that his analysis \"on the basis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\"[270] In October 2020, Kavanaugh agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[271]\n\n\nIn 2021, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption and social service agency that had been denied funding by the City of Philadelphia because it does not place children for adoption with same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices\".[272] The same month, Kavanaugh was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist, whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower courts' judgments in place.[273][274][275] In November 2021, Kavanaugh voted with the majority of justices in a 6\u20133 decision to decline to hear an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[276] Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; because four votes are required to hear an appeal, the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[277][278]\n\n\n\n### President Trump's taxes[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in *Trump v. Vance*, the Supreme Court ruled in two 7\u20132 decisions that the Manhattan District Attorney could access Trump's tax records, but that the issue of whether Congress could access the same records needed to be processed through the lower courts. Kavanaugh joined Roberts, Gorsuch, and the court's four Democratic appointees in the majority;[279] Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.[280] The rulings mean that the Manhattan DA will have access to the records while Congress does not, pending the outcome of the case in lower courts.[281]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nEight days before the 2020 presidential election Kavanaugh concurred that absentee votes properly cast in Wisconsin but received after November 3 must be discarded, joining the Court's conservatives in a ruling that requires deferral to state officials on elections.[282][283] On October 19, Kavanaugh voted to grant a request for a stay that would have prevented ballots sent before Election Day but delivered within three days after it from being counted. The Court was split 4\u20134, so the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania requiring all votes to be counted stood, but the case may be reheard.[284] Kavanaugh sided with Roberts and three liberal justices in a 5-3 majority to allow voting extension in North Carolina.[285]\n\n\n\n### Compensation of college athletes[edit]\n\n\nIn his concurrence in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston* in June 2021, in which the Court ruled unanimously that college sports were not exempt from antitrust law, Kavanaugh called the NCAA \"a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated.\" No one else, he said, could \"not ... pay workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.\" He said there were \"serious questions\" about other rules on compensation.[286]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh assassination plot\n\nIn the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide.[18][287] After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh stemmed from dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, as well as the potential for the Court to loosen gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Roske was armed with a pistol, two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and other items. He has been charged with attempted murder.[18]\n\n\n\n## Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on separation of powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School in 2009.[288] In 2008, Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, then the dean of Harvard Law School. According to *The Boston Globe*, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[291] After the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Harvard Law School graduates[*which?*] petitioned Harvard to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[292] In the summer of 2019, he joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[293]\n\n\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the *Minnesota Law Review* in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[294] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis\".[295] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly\", they may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[294] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[294] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[295]\n\n\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[296] To remedy this, he encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\", such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[296]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kavanaugh family with President Bush\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to former President George W. Bush,[297] married in 2004; the couple have two daughters.[298] They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\n\n\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[299] His bibs bore non-qualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[300] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5\u00a0km to 10 miles.[301][302]\n\n\nKavanaugh is a Roman Catholic[297] and serves as a regular lector at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament at Hanceville, Alabama. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[297][303]\n\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Kavanaugh, Brett (1989). \"Note: Defense Presence and Participation: A Procedural Minimum for Batson v.

Barrett was a U.S. circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\nBarrett graduated from Rhodes College before attending Notre Dame Law School, earning a J.D. with distinction in 1997. She then clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman and Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2002, Barrett joined the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, becoming a professor in 2010. While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United States.[6][7][8] Her nomination was controversial because the 2020 presidential election was only 38 days away and Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland during an election year in 2016.[9] The next month, the U.S.\u00a0Senate voted 52\u201348 to confirm her nomination, with all Democrats and one Republican in opposition.[10]\n\n\nDescribed as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Justice Antonin Scalia,[11][12][13] Barrett supports textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation.[14][15][16] She is generally considered to be among the Court's conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Vivian Coney was born in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Linda (*n\u00e9e* Vath) and Michael Coney.[17][18] The eldest of seven children, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company, and her mother was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett has Irish and French ancestry.[19][20] Her maternal ancestors were from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland, while there is also Irish lineage among her father's ancestors. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans.[21] Her family is devoutly Catholic, and her father is an ordained deacon at St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Metairie, Louisiana, where she grew up.[22][23]\n\n\nBarrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans.[24] She was student body vice president of the school and graduated in 1990.[25] After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She considers herself \"somewhat fluent\" in French, but with a Louisiana accent.[26] Barrett graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa.[27] In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate.[28]\n\n\nBarrett then attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the *Notre Dame Law Review* and graduated in 1997 ranked first in her class with a Juris Doctor, *summa cum laude*.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships and private practice[edit]\n\n\nBarrett spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001.[29][31] While at Baker Botts, she worked on *Bush v. Gore*, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for the firm's representation of George W. Bush.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Barrett was a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School. In 2002, she joined the faculty of her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School.[34] At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, evidence, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.[35] Barrett was named a professor of law at Notre Dame in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held Notre Dame's Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law.[36] Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and *stare decisis*.[28] Her academic work has been published in the *Columbia*, *Cornell*, *Virginia*, *Notre Dame*, and *Texas* law reviews.[34]\n\n\nAt Notre Dame, Barrett received the \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" award three times.[34] From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established to inspire a \"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\".[37] While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory.[38][39]\n\n\nIn 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.[34]\n\n\n\n## Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (2017\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nFile:Prof Amy Coney Barrett 2 10.jpgBarrett before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 6, 2017\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\u2014the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin\u2014after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty.[42] Asked to \"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\"[43][44] and \"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"[45] Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\"[46] Worried that Barrett would not uphold *Roe v. Wade* given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\"[47][48][49]\n\n\nThe hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives.[29] Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins of the University of Notre Dame and Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \"religious test\" for office;[45][50] others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her investiture for the Seventh Circuit in 2018\nLambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization, co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate\u2014indeed, it obfuscates\u2014how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination.[54][55]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11\u20139 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate.[56][57] On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54\u201342.[58] It confirmed her by a vote of 55\u201343 on October 31, with three Democrats\u2014Joe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin\u2014voting for her.[27] She received her commission two days later.[2] Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit.[59]\n\n\n\n### Selected cases[edit]\n\n\nOral arguments from *Cook County, Illinois v. Chad F. Wolf*, one of the last cases that Barrett took in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020\nOn the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.[60][61] Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.[62][63]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing *en banc*. Three judges\u2014Chief Judge Diane Wood and judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton\u2014voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \"separate-but-equal arrangement\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5\u20133 decision.[64][29]\n\n\nIn 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of *Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation*. Smith was a Black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \"stupid-ass nigger\" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \"poor performance\".[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge rule\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card.[67] In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under *Chevron* Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act.[68] The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split.[68][69]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.[70] In a 2\u20131 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing *en banc* (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion-related cases[edit]\n\n\nBarrett had never ruled directly on abortion before joining the Supreme Court, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.[72][73]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \"bubble ordinance\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent.[74][75] Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in *Hill v. Colorado*, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.[77] The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by plaintiff Rickey Kanter, who had been convicted of felony mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment.[78] President Trump pardoned Kanter in December 2020.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal procedure[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking.[80] Following rehearing *en banc*, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \"playing with guns\", because no crime had been alleged.[82] Barrett distinguished *Navarette v. California* and wrote, \"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\"[83]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.[84][85]\n\n\n\n#### Qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff.[86] (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \"clearly established law\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity.[87]\n\n\nIn *Howard v. Koeller* (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \"snitch\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers*, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) from the nearest navigable river was among the \"waters of the United States.\"[90] The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable\u2010in\u2010fact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in *Rapanos v. United States*. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\"[93][94][95]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus measures[edit]\n\n\nIn early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.[30][96] On August 12, 2021, she rejected a challenge to Indiana University's vaccine mandate, marking the first legal test of COVID-19 vaccine mandates before the Supreme Court.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Civil procedure and standing[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III.[98] Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split.[99][100][101]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the *Shakman* case because it was not formally a party to the case.[102] The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020\nBarrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation.[104] In July 2018, after Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.[36][105][106]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh's selection in 2018, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.[107] After the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020, Barrett was widely mentioned as the front-runner to succeed her.[108] On September 26, 2020, Trump announced his intention to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death.[7][109]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who sought to confirm her before the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] She was a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.[72][111][112] Democrats generally opposed the nomination, and were opposed to filling the court vacancy while election voting was already underway in many states.[110] Many observers were angered by the move to fill the vacancy only four months before the end of Trump's term, as the Senate Republican majority had refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, more than ten months before the end of his presidency.[110][113][114]\n\n\nIn October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \"well qualified\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.[115] The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\".[116] Barrett's nomination came during a White House COVID-19 outbreak. On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing,[117] which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.[118][119] On October 22, the Judiciary Committee reported her confirmation favorably by a 12\u20130 vote, with all 10 Democrats boycotting the committee meeting.[120][121] On October 25, the Senate voted mostly along party lines to end debate on the confirmation.[122] On October 26, the Senate confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52\u201348, 30 days after her nomination and 8 days before the 2020 presidential election. Every Republican senator except Susan Collins voted to confirm her, whereas every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus[123] voted in opposition.[124] Barrett is the first justice since 1870 to be confirmed without a single vote from the Senate minority party.[125][126]\n\n\nThe nature of her appointment was criticized by numerous Democratic politicians; Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called it \"the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate.\"[127] Republicans responded that they were merely exercising their constitutional rights, and that accusations of hypocrisy were nothing more than \"an unwarranted tantrum from the left\".[127]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2020\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to Barrett on October 26, 2020, at the White House alongside President Donald Trump\n![](image)Chief Justice John Roberts administers the judicial oath to Barrett on October 27, 2020. Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse M. Barrett, holds the Bible.\nBarrett became the 103rd associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 27, 2020. On the evening of the confirmation vote, Trump hosted a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. As Barrett requested, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to her,[126][128][129] the first of two necessary oaths. She took the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the next day.[130]\n\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Barrett was assigned to the Seventh Circuit.[136] This assignment's duties include responding to emergency applications to the Court that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by herself or else by referring them to the full Court for review.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### Early oral argument participation[edit]\n\n\nHaving hired her allotted four law clerks, Barrett took part in her first oral argument on November 2, hearing the case *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club.*[138][139]\n\n\nOn November 4, the Court heard *Fulton v. Philadelphia*, in which the plaintiff, Catholic Social Services, sued the city of Philadelphia after being denied a new contract under the city's Fair Practices Ordinance, which bars discrimination in public accommodations. The Archdiocese-affiliated CSS said that for religious reasons it cannot properly vet potential foster parents who are gay couples. CSS argued that under relevant precedent, the Court should find that CSS as a faith-based charity was unfairly singled out, given that the city allows race- and disability-based exceptions within foster-care placements.[140][141] CSS further claimed the law is shown not to be neutral as required by the Court's 1990 decision *Employment Division v. Smith*, which allows the government to enforce neutral and generally applicable laws without having to make exceptions for individual religions, because the city labeled CSS's motives \"discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\"[141][142] According to the *New York Times,* Barrett's questions during oral arguments were \"evenhanded and did not reveal her position.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### First votes as a justice[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Barrett joined the Supreme Court's majority in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*,[144] 592 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020), in an unsigned[145] 5\u20134 preliminary injunction in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish organization Agudath Israel of America, saying that certain COVID-19 restrictions instituted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had likely violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in that they \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.\"[146][147][148][149] The Court said that the restrictions had likely impinged on the fundamental right of the free exercise of religion without their (in constitutional legal parlance) passing the legal test of \"strict scrutiny.\"[150] Cuomo's order was more restrictive than governmental orders involved in similar cases involving churches in California and Nevada that the Court had allowed to stand by a 5\u20134 vote.[151][152][153] Ross Guberman, author of *Point Taken: How to Write Like the World's Best Judges*, told the *Times* he believed Barrett was the principal author of the Court's decision because of its measured tone and word choices, including its use of the word \"show\".[154]\n\n\nBarrett delivered her first concurring opinion on February 5, 2021, in the case *South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom*.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Barrett joined the majority, in a 5\u20134 vote, to reject a petition to temporarily block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined her in the majority.[157]\nIn June 2022, Barrett joined with the same majority in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[158]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Supreme Court voted to allow the execution of an inmate to proceed in Alabama; the case was decided by a 5\u20134 vote, with Barrett joining Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in dissent.[159]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote her first majority opinion in *United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club*, which was decided on March 4, 2021.[155][160][161] Traditionally the first opinion delivered by a new justice reflects the opinion of a unanimous court, but not always. While Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wrote unanimous first opinions, Barrett, like her predecessor Justice Ginsburg, wrote an opinion for a divided court.[155][162][163]\n\n\nAlthough Barrett ruled against environmentalists in March, she voted against oil refineries in her first dissent, *Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v.

City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic social service agency that had been denied funding from the City of Philadelphia because it does not adopt to same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[165] In the same month, Barrett was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower court judgments in place.[166][167][168] In November 2021, Barrett voted with the majority in a 6\u20133 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[169] The Court's decision not to hear the case left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Vaccine requirements[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote a concurring opinion in *Does v. Mills,* a case challenging Maine's vaccine requirement for health care workers. She was in the majority in the 6\u20133 decision to deny a stay of the vaccine requirement, explaining that the case had not been fully briefed or argued.*[172]*\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy, academic writings, speeches, and political views[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Jay Schweikert, who advocates for the Court's or Congress's elimination of qualified immunity,[176] believes that her \"decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.\"[175][177] Legal commentator Jacob Sullum argues that while Barrett was on the Seventh Circuit she took \"a constrained view of the doctrine's scope.\"[178]\n\n\n\n### Textualism and originalism[edit]\n\n\nBarrett is considered a textualist, a proponent of the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering their legislative history or underlying purpose,[179][180][181][182] and an originalist (of the original-public-meaning, rather than original-intent, variety), a proponent of the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment.[179][183][184][185] According to her, \"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\"[183] For the purpose of \"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\" she refers[183] to a section of a law review article by Keith Whittington, \"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\",[186] that reads, \"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\"[186]\n\n\nTextualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \"ordinary meaning\": \"The law is comprised of words\u2014and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\" According to Barrett, \"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\".[187]\n\n\nBarrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism,[188] writing: \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\"[189] In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\"[183] In a 2017 article in the law review *Constitutional Commentary*, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\"[190][191]\n\n\nAccording to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\" Scalia insisted that \"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\"[192][193]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism.[192][193] She said that one example of the \"process-based\" approach can be found in *King v. Burwell*, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" to mean \"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\"[193]\n\n\n\n#### Suspension of habeas corpus[edit]\n\n\nIn a journal article, \"Suspension and Delegation\",[194] Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which *habeas corpus* may be legitimately suspended.[195] In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred\u2014and in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\"[81][194] In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in *Boumediene v. Bush* after considering historical factors.[196]\n\n\n\n### Precedent[edit]\n\n\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\";[197][198] she also said judges \"must apply the law as written\".[199][200] She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.[201]\n\n\nIn a 2013 article in the *Texas Law Review* on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \"superprecedents\"\u2014cases the Court would never consider overturning. They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as evidence that *Roe* had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as *Roe v. Wade* has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"[202][203]\n\n\nConcerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\"[202] She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"[202]\n\n\n\n### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.[204]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius* (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did\u2014as a penalty\u2014he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"[191][205][204][206]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBarrett opposes abortion.[207][208] In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper. The ad read: \"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of *Roe v. Wade* and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\"[209][210][211] In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against *Roe v. Wade* that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \"killed 55 million unborn children\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.[212]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020\n![](image)Then-Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse, in 2018\nIn 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal \u2013 LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC, in South Bend, Indiana,[213] and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.[214] Previously, Jesse Barrett had worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana for 13 years.[215] The couple live in South Bend and have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, one in 2005 and one after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[32][216] Their youngest biological child has Down syndrome.[217]\n\n\nBarrett is a practicing Catholic.[218] Since birth, she has been a member of the Christian parachurch community People of Praise,[219] an ecumenical covenant community founded in South Bend. Associated with the Catholic charismatic renewal movement but not formally affiliated with the Catholic Church,[220][221][222] about 90% of its approximately 1,700 members are Catholic.[220][222] In People of Praise, Barrett has served as a laypastoral women's leader in a position once termed \"handmaiden\" but now termed \"women leader\".[223][224]\n\n\nAccording to *Politico*, \"a copy of Barrett's ballot history from the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System obtained by POLITICO [shows] Barrett voted in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, and the 2016 Republican primary, though she pulled a Democratic ballot in the 2011 primary.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nBarrett was a member of the Federalist Society from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2017.[48][27][29] She is a member of the American Law Institute.[225]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Barrett's academic publications:[226]\n\n\n\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

Jackson was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office that same year.[1][2] She is the first black woman and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nJackson was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Miami, Florida. She received her undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, where she served as an editor of the *Harvard Law Review*, and clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she later assumed on the Supreme Court.[3] From 2010 to 2014, Jackson was the vice chairwoman of the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed her as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served until 2021. Since 2016, Jackson has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C.,[4] to parents who had been educated at historically black colleges and universities.[5][6][7] Her father, Johnny Brown, attended the University of Miami School of Law and became chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board. Her mother, Ellery, was school principal at the New World School of the Arts in Miami.[8][9] One of her uncles, Calvin Ross, served as the chief of the Miami Police Department.[8]\n\n\nJackson grew up in Miami and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School.[10] She distinguished herself as a champion debater,[11] winning the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans during her senior year.[12] She has recalled her experience with high school debate as one \"that I can say without hesitation was the one activity that best prepared me for future success in law and in life.\"[13] In 1988, Jackson graduated from Palmetto as senior class president.[11][14] In her high school yearbook, she was quoted as saying that she wanted \"to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment\".[15]\n\n\nAfter high school, Jackson matriculated at Harvard University to study government, having applied despite her guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower.[16] She took classes in drama and performed improv comedy, forming a diverse friend group.[17][18] As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dormitory window and protested the lack of full-time professors in the Afro-American Studies Department. While a freshman, Jackson enrolled in Michael Sandel's course *Justice*, which she has called a major influence during her undergraduate years.[18]\n\n\nIn 1989, when Jackson was a college student, an uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction after federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in duct tape. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case *pro bono*, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence.[19][20]\n\n\nJackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*.[21][11] Her senior thesis was titled \"The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants\".[22] From 1992 to 1993, Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for *Time* magazine,[23] attending Harvard Law School shortly afterward. She was a supervising editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997,[23] then to Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998.[26] She spent a year in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin (now part of Baker Botts), then clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer from 1999 to 2000.[10][27]\n\n\nJackson returned to private legal practice at the law firm of Goodwin Procter from 2000 to 2002, then under Kenneth Feinberg at the law firm now called Feinberg & Rozen LLP from 2002 to 2003.[28][29] From 2003 to 2005, she was an assistant special counsel to the United States Sentencing Commission.[30] From 2005 to 2007, Jackson was an assistant federal public defender in Washington, D.C., where she handled cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[31] A review by *The* *Washington Post* of cases Jackson handled during her time as a public defender showed that \"she won uncommon victories against the government that shortened or erased lengthy prison terms\".[32] From 2007 to 2010, Jackson was an appellate specialist in private practice at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.[29][27]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.[33][34] The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote on November 5, 2009. The Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on February 11, 2010.[35] She succeeded Michael E. Horowitz, who had served from 2003 until 2009. Jackson served on the Sentencing Commission until 2014.[36][27] During her time on the commission, it retroactively amended the sentencing guidelines to reduce the guideline range for crack cocaine offenses,[37] and enacted the \"drugs minus two\" amendment, which implemented a two offense-level reduction for drug crimes.[38]\n\n\n\n## District Court (2013\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pictured in 2019)\nOn September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States district judge for the District of Columbia to the seat vacated by retiring judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr.[39] Republican U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a relative by marriage, introduced Jackson at her December 2012 confirmation hearing and said, \"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.\"[8] On February 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote.[40] She was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on March 22, received her commission on March 26,[27] and was sworn in by Justice Breyer in May.[41] Her service as a district judge ended on June 17, 2021, when she was elevated to the court of appeals.[27]\n\n\nDuring her time on the district court, Jackson wrote multiple decisions adverse to the positions of the Trump administration. In her opinion ordering Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a legislative subpoena, she wrote that \"presidents are not kings\".[42] Jackson handled a number of challenges to executive agency actions that raised questions of administrative law. She also issued rulings in several cases that gained particular political attention.[43]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Law* reported in spring 2021 that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a \"potential blemish on her record\".[44] In 2019, Jackson ruled that provisions in three Trump executive orders conflicted with federal employee rights to collective bargaining. Her decision was reversed unanimously by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit also reversed another 2019 decision, involving a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security decision to expand the agency's definition of which non-citizens can be deported. Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron defended Jackson's record, saying she \"has written nearly 600 opinions and been reversed less than twelve times\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Selected rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson in 2020\nIn *American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture* (2013), Jackson rejected the meat packing industry's request for a preliminary injunction to block a United States Department of Agriculture rule requiring them to identify animals' country of origin. Jackson found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment.[45][46]\n\n\nIn *Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services* (2014), Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug Gralise. She concluded that the Orphan Drug Act required the FDA to grant Gralise exclusivity.[47]\n\n\nIn *Pierce v. District of Columbia* (2015), Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to provide the inmate with reasonable accommodations, or to assess his need for reasonable accommodations, during his detention in 2012. She held that \"the District's willful blindness regarding\" Pierce's need for accommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment of auxiliary aids\u2014and only after he specifically requested them\u2014fell far short of what the law requires.\"[48]\n\n\nIn April and June 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early.[49] She ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early without explanation was arbitrary and capricious.[50]\n\n\nIn *American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump* (2018), Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time federal employee labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. She ruled that the executive orders violated the right of federal employees to collectively bargain, as guaranteed by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.[51] The D.C. Circuit vacated this ruling on jurisdictional grounds in 2019.[52][53]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jackson dismissed 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation. She held that under the doctrine of *forum non conveniens*, the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this ruling in 2020.[54][55][56][57]\n\n\nIn 2019, in *Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan*, Jackson held that Congress had, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional challenges to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border.[58]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in *Make The Road New York v. McAleenan*, blocking a Trump administration rule that would have expanded expedited removal (\"fast-track\" deportations) without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants.[59] She found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule.[60] In a 2\u20131 ruling in 2020, the D.C. Circuit reversed the entry of the preliminary injunction, ruling that the IIRIRA (by committing the matter to the executive branch's \"sole and unreviewable discretion\") precluded APA review of the decision.[61]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a ruling in *Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn*, in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued former White House Counsel Don McGahn to compel him to comply with the subpoena to appear at an impeachment inquiry hearing on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\" even if the president orders them not to do so.[62] Jackson rejected the administration's assertion of executive testimonial immunity by holding that \"with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist\".[63] According to her, that conclusion was \"inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law.\"[63][64][65] Jackson's use of the phrase \"presidents are not kings\" gained popular attention in subsequent media reporting on the ruling.[66][67][68][69] Noting that she took four months to resolve the case, including writing a 120-page opinion, *The Washington Post* wrote: \"That slow pace contributed to helping Mr. Trump run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort before the 2020 election.\"[8] The ruling was appealed by the United States Department of Justice,[70] and the D.C. Circuit affirmed part of Jackson's decision in August 2020.[71] While the case remained pending, on June 4, 2021, McGahn testified behind closed doors under an agreement reached with the Biden administration.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson with Justice Stephen BreyerOn March 30, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Jackson as a United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.[73] On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. Biden nominated Jackson to the seat vacated by Judge Merrick Garland, who had stepped down to become U.S. Attorney General.[74] The American Bar Association appraised Jackson as \"well qualified with no recusals or abstentions\".[75]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[76] During her confirmation hearing, Jackson was questioned about several of her rulings against the Trump administration.[77] On May 20, Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee by a 13\u20139 vote.[78] On June 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on her nomination. On June 10, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52\u201346 vote.[79] On June 14, her nomination was confirmed by a 53\u201344 vote. Republican senators Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski joined all 50 Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.[80] She received her judicial commission on June 17, 2021.[81] Her service as a circuit judge ended on June 29, 2022, the day before she was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[27]\n\n\nIn her first written opinion for the court of appeals, Jackson, joined by the rest of the panel, invalidated a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.[82]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Jackson delivers remarks on her nomination in the Grand Foyer of the White House. (February 25, 2022)\n![](image)Justice Breyer administering the Judicial Oath to Jackson (June 30, 2022)\nIn early 2016, Obama administration officials vetted Jackson as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[83][84][85] Jackson was one of five candidates interviewed as a potential nominee.[86]\n\n\nIn early 2022, news outlets speculated that Biden would nominate Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Breyer.[87][88][89][90] Biden pledged during the 2020 United States presidential election campaign to appoint a Black woman to the court should a vacancy occur.[87] Jackson's appointment to the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most influential federal court, was viewed as preparation for a potential promotion to the Supreme Court.[91]\n\n\nJackson's potential nomination to the Supreme Court was supported by civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations.[19] Her potential nomination was opposed by Republican Party leaders and senators.[92][93][94] *The Washington Post* wrote that Jackson's experience as a public defender \"has endeared her to the more liberal base of the Democratic Party\".[95] While her supporters have touted her history as a public defender as an asset, during her 2021 confirmation hearing, Republicans tried to cast it as a liability.[32]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Biden announced that Jackson was his nominee to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court.[96] Her nomination was sent to the Senate on February 28.[97] Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on March 21.[98] After the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination by an 11\u201311 vote, the Senate discharged the committee from further consideration of her nomination by a 53\u201347 vote.[99][100][101][102] The next day, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of her nomination by a 53\u201347 vote,[103] and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then filed cloture on her nomination.[104] On April 7, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 53\u201347 vote.[105][106] Later that day, she was confirmed by the same margin.[107] Republicans Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in confirming Jackson to the Supreme Court.[108] She received her judicial commission as an associate justice on April 8.[27] She was sworn in and became an associate justice at noon on June 30, 2022, when Breyer's retirement went into effect.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\n\n## U. S. Supreme Court (2022\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court released its final merit opinions on the morning of June 30, 2022. At noon, Breyer officially retired and Jackson was sworn in, becoming the first Black woman[13][11] and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\nOn July 21, Jackson voted on her first Supreme Court case, joining the dissent in a 5\u20134 decision refusing to block a district court ruling that prevented the Biden administration from setting new enforcement priorities for immigrants entering the U.S. or living in the country illegally.[117] She participated in her first oral argument as an associate justice on October 3, in *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*.[118] On November 7 she wrote her first opinion, a two-page dissent from a denial of review in the case of a death row inmate in *Chinn v. Shoop*; the opinion was joined by Justice Sotomayor.[119]\n\n\nTwo contributors to *SCOTUSBlog* noted that, since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments, speaking an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000.[120] On February 28, 2023, Jackson authored her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in *Delaware v. Pennsylvania*, which involved how unclaimed money from MoneyGrams are distributed among individual states.[121]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, Jackson was assigned as the circuit justice for the First Circuit.[122]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters, concerning the power of employers to sue labor unions regarding the destruction of employer property following a strike. She wrote that the majority's decision failed \"Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes\" and ran the risk of potential \"erosion of the right to strike\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson at the James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner on February 24, 2020\nJackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy;[124] instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\".[125][126] Though she has not embraced the label, Jackson has expressed that she sees value in originalism, saying the \"Constitution is fixed in its meaning\", and has explicitly criticized living constitutionalism.[126]\n\n\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported that Jackson had \"not yet written a body of appeals court opinions expressing a legal philosophy\" because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2021. However, *The Times* said, Jackson's earlier rulings \"comported with those of a liberal-leaning judge\", including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions.[8] Additionally, a review of over 500 of her judicial opinions indicated that she would likely be as liberal as Breyer, the justice she replaced.[127]\n\n\nAccording to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" due to her relative youth, background as a public defender, and history of labor-friendly rulings.[128]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married surgeon Patrick Graves Jackson, whom she met at Harvard College.[130] He is a descendant of Continental Congress delegate Jonathan Jackson[131] and is related to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[132] The couple have two daughters.[133][134][135] Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[136] In a 2017 speech, she said, \"I am fairly certain that if you traced my family lineage back past my grandparents\u2014who were raised in Georgia, by the way\u2014you would find that my ancestors were slaves on both sides.\"[137] Jackson's paternal ancestry can be traced to Houston County, Georgia,[138] while her maternal ancestry can be traced to Calhoun County, Georgia.[139] Through her marriage, Jackson is related to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[140]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nJackson is a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services as well as Harvard University's Board of Overseers and the Council of the American Law Institute.[141] She also serves on the board of Georgetown Day School[142] and the U.S. Supreme Court Fellows Commission.[143]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, she served on the advisory board of Montrose Christian School, a Baptist school.[144] Jackson has served as a judge in several mock trials with the Shakespeare Theatre Company[145][146][147] and for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia's Mock Court Program.[148] In 2018, she presided over a mock trial hosted by Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law \"to determine if Vice President Aaron Burr was guilty of murdering\" Alexander Hamilton.[149]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jackson presented at the University of Georgia School of Law's 35th Edith House Lecture.[150] In 2018, she was a panelist at the National Constitution Center's town hall on Alexander Hamilton's legacy.[151] In 2020, Jackson gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day lecture at the University of Michigan Law School[152] and was honored at the University of Chicago Law School's third annual Judge James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner, hosted by the school's Black Law Students Association.[153] In 2022, she received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, presented by Awards Council members Justice Amy Coney Barrett and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154][155]\n\n\nJackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Recent Case (1995). \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) \u2013 Scope of Liability after Reves v.

Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\"[4] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[5][6]\n\n\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Justice\n | State[c] | Position\n | Succeeded\n | Date confirmed(Vote)\n | Tenure\n | Tenure length[d] | Nominated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | John Jay(1745\u20131829) | NY | ChiefJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 19, 1789\u2013June 29, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 253\u00a0days\n | George Washington |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | John Rutledge(1739\u20131800) | SC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 15, 1790[e]\u2013March 5, 1791(Resigned) | 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | William Cushing(1732\u20131810) | MA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013September 13, 1810(Died) | 20\u00a0years, 223\u00a0days\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | James Wilson(1742\u20131798) | PA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 5, 1789[e]\u2013August 21, 1798(Died) | 8\u00a0years, 320\u00a0days\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Blair(1732\u20131800) | VA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013October 25, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 265\u00a0days\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | James Iredell(1751\u20131799) | NC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | February 10, 1790(Acclamation)\n | May 12, 1790\u2013October 20, 1799(Died) | 9\u00a0years, 161\u00a0days\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Thomas Johnson(1732\u20131819) | MD | AssociateJustice | J.

It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal court cases, and over state court cases that involve a point of U.S. Constitutional or federal law. It also has original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, specifically \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party.\"[1] The court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution. It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law.[2] However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The court may decide cases having political overtones, but has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions.\n\n\nEstablished by Article Three of the United States Constitution, the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The court consists of nine justices: the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, and the justices meet at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. Justices have lifetime tenure, meaning they remain on the court until they die, retire, resign, or are impeached and removed from office.[3] When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints a new justice. Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before the court. When in the majority, the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court; otherwise, the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court receives on average about 7,000 petitions for writs of certiorari each year, but grants only 70\u201390.[4] In recent years[*when?*], the Supreme Court has seen substantial criticism over democratic backsliding, ethics scandals and a lack of external enforcement, partisan rulings, secretive decisions, and limited and slow ability to take on cases, among other controversies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n![](image)The Royal Exchange, New York City, the first meeting place of the Supreme Court\n![Image of two-story brick building.](image)The court lacked its own building until 1935; from 1791 to 1801, it met in Philadelphia's City Hall, before moving to the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\nIt was while debating the separation of powers between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention established the parameters for the national judiciary. Creating a \"third branch\" of government was a novel idea; in the English tradition, judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal (executive) authority. Early on, the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including James Madison, advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of tribunals chosen by the national legislature. It was proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive's power to veto or revise laws.\n\n\nEventually, the framers compromised by sketching only a general outline of the judiciary in Article Three of the United States Constitution, vesting federal judicial power in \"one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\"[5][6] They delineated neither the exact powers and prerogatives of the Supreme Court nor the organization of the judicial branch as a whole.\n\n\nThe 1st United States Congress provided the detailed organization of a federal judiciary through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Supreme Court, the country's highest judicial tribunal, was to sit in the nation's capital and would initially be composed of a chief justice and five associate justices. The act also divided the country into judicial districts, which were in turn organized into circuits. Justices were required to \"ride circuit\" and hold circuit court twice a year in their assigned judicial district.[7]\n\n\nImmediately after signing the act into law, President George Washington nominated the following people to serve on the court: John Jay for chief justice and John Rutledge, William Cushing, Robert H. Harrison, James Wilson, and John Blair Jr. as associate justices. All six were confirmed by the Senate on September 26, 1789; however, Harrison declined to serve, and Washington later nominated James Iredell in his place.[8]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court held its inaugural session from February 2 through February 10, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City, then the U.S. capital.[9] A second session was held there in August 1790.[10] The earliest sessions of the court were devoted to organizational proceedings, as the first cases did not reach it until 1791.[7] When the nation's capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790, the Supreme Court did so as well. After initially meeting at Independence Hall, the court established its chambers at City Hall.[11]\n\n\n\n### Early beginnings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Jay Court, Rutledge Court, Ellsworth Court, and Marshall Court\n\n![](image)John Marshall, chief justice from 1801 to 1835\nUnder chief justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789\u20131801), the court heard few cases; its first decision was *West v. Barnes* (1791), a case involving procedure.[12] As the court initially had only six members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting four to two).[13] However, Congress has always allowed less than the court's full membership to make decisions, starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789.[14] The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige,[15] a situation not helped by the era's highest-profile case, *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793), which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.[16]\n\n\nThe court's power and prestige grew substantially during the Marshall Court (1801\u20131835).[17] Under Marshall, the court established the power of judicial review over acts of Congress,[18] including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution (*Marbury v. Madison*)[19][20] and making several important constitutional rulings that gave shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and states, notably *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, *McCulloch v. Maryland*, and *Gibbons v. Ogden*.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\nThe Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion *seriatim*,[25] a remnant of British tradition,[26] and instead issuing a single majority opinion.[25] Also during Marshall's tenure, although beyond the court's control, the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel Chase from 1804 to 1805 helped cement the principle of judicial independence.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### From Taney to Taft[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Taney Court, Chase Court, Waite Court, Fuller Court, White Court, and Taft Court\n\nThe Taney Court (1836\u20131864) made several important rulings, such as *Sheldon v. Sill*, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects.[29] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in *Dred Scott v. Sandford*,[30] which helped precipitate the American Civil War.[31] In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864\u20131910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution[24] and developed the doctrine of substantive due process (*Lochner v. New York*;[32] *Adair v. United States*).[33] It was in 1869 that the size of the court last changed, being set at nine.\n\n\nUnder the White and Taft Courts (1910\u20131930), the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states (*Gitlow v. New York*),[34] grappled with the new antitrust statutes (*Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States*), upheld the constitutionality of military conscription (*Selective Draft Law Cases*),[35] and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee (*Adkins v. Children's Hospital*).[36]\n\n\n\n### New Deal era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hughes Court, Stone Court, Vinson Court, and Warren Court\n\n![](image)The U.S. Supreme Court Building, current home of the Supreme Court, which opened in 1935\n![The Court seated](image)The Hughes Court in 1937, photographed by Erich Salomon. Members include Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (center), Louis Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo, Harlan Stone, Owen Roberts, and the \"Four Horsemen\" Pierce Butler, James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter, who opposed New Deal policies.\nDuring the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930\u20131953), the court gained its own accommodation in 1935[37] and changed its interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal (most prominently *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, Wickard v. Filburn*, *United States v. Darby*, and *United States v. Butler*).[38][39][40] During World War II, the court continued to favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese Americans (*Korematsu v. United States*) and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance (*Minersville School District v. Gobitis*). Nevertheless, *Gobitis* was soon repudiated (*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*), and the *Steel Seizure Case* restricted the pro-government trend.\n\n\nThe Warren Court (1953\u20131969) dramatically expanded the force of Constitutional civil liberties.[41] It held that segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (*Brown v. Board of Education*, *Bolling v. Sharpe*, and *Green v. County School Bd.*)[42] and that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population (*Reynolds v. Sims*). It recognized a general right to privacy (*Griswold v. Connecticut*),[43] limited the role of religion in public school, most prominently *Engel v. Vitale* and *Abington School District v. Schempp*,[44][45] incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states, prominently *Mapp v. Ohio* (the exclusionary rule) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (right to appointed counsel),[46][47] and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police (*Miranda v. Arizona*).[48] At the same time, the court limited defamation suits by public figures (*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*) and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories.[49]\n\n\n\n### Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Burger Court, Rehnquist Court, and Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Justices of the Supreme Court with President George W. Bush (center-right) in October 2005. The justices (left to right) are: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Antonin Scalia, John Paul Stevens, John Roberts, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer\nThe Burger Court (1969\u20131986) saw a conservative shift.[50] It also expanded *Griswold*'s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws (*Roe v. Wade*)[51] but divided deeply on affirmative action (*Regents of the University of California v. Bakke*)[52] and campaign finance regulation (*Buckley v. Valeo*).[53] It also wavered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications were defective (*Furman v. Georgia*),[54] but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional (*Gregg v. Georgia*).[54][55][56]\n\n\nThe Rehnquist Court (1986\u20132005) was known for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism,[57] emphasizing the limits of the Constitution's affirmative grants of power (*United States v. Lopez*) and the force of its restrictions on those powers (*Seminole Tribe v. Florida*, *City of Boerne v. Flores*).[58][59][60][61][62] It struck down single-sex state schools as a violation of equal protection (*United States v. Virginia*), laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process (*Lawrence v. Texas*)[63] and the line-item veto (*Clinton v. New York*) but upheld school vouchers (*Zelman v. Simmons-Harris*) and reaffirmed *Roe*'s restrictions on abortion laws (*Planned Parenthood v. Casey*).[64] The court's decision in *Bush v. Gore*, which ended the electoral recount during the 2000 United States presidential election, was especially controversial.[65][66]\n\n\nThe Roberts Court (2005\u2013present) is regarded as more conservative than the Rehnquist Court.[67][68][69][70] Some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption (*Wyeth v. Levine*), civil procedure (*Twombly\u2013Iqbal*), voting rights and federal preclearance (*Shelby County\u2013Brnovich*), abortion (*Gonzales v. Carhart* and *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*),[71] climate change (*Massachusetts v. EPA*), same-sex marriage (*United States v. Windsor* and *Obergefell v. Hodges*), and the Bill of Rights, such as in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* and *Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta* (First Amendment),[72] *Heller\u2013McDonald\u2013Bruen* (Second Amendment),[73] and *Baze v. Rees* (Eighth Amendment).[74][75]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination, confirmation, and appointment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n![](image)John Roberts giving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 2005 hearings on his nomination to be chief justice\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court. This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution. The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee. The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose.[76][77][78]\n\n\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955.[79] Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert Bork, nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n\n\nAlthough Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative or tied vote in committee to block a nomination, prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full Senate. President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of sitting associate justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia's death was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, only Democratic senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy.[80] This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruth Bader Ginsburg giving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 1993 hearings on her nomination to be an associate justice\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred with President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers in 2005. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, as the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was filled by Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of President Trump.[82]\n\n\nOnce the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and sign a commission, to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed, before the appointee can take office.[83] The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the confirmation or swearing-in date.[84] After receiving their commission, the appointee must then take the two prescribed oaths before assuming their official duties.[85] The importance of the oath taking is underscored by the case of Edwin M. Stanton. Although confirmed by the Senate on December 20, 1869, and duly commissioned as an associate justice by President Ulysses S. Grant, Stanton died on December 24, prior to taking the prescribed oaths. He is not, therefore, considered to have been a member of the court.[86][87]\n\n\nBefore 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, the process has taken much longer and some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[88] According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (2.3 months).[89][90]\n\n\n\n#### Recess appointments[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies. Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less than two years). The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed.[91]\n\n\nNo U.S. president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the court, and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts.[92] In 1960, after Eisenhower had made three such appointments, the Senate passed a \"sense of the Senate\" resolution that recess appointments to the court should only be made in \"unusual circumstances\";[93] such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress's views in the hope of guiding executive action.[93][94]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court's 2014 decision in *National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning* limited the ability of the president to make recess appointments (including appointments to the Supreme Court); the court ruled that the Senate decides when the Senate is in session or in recess. Writing for the court, Justice Breyer stated, \"We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\"[95] This ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of pro-forma sessions.[96]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![The interior of the United States Supreme Court](image)The interior of the United States Supreme Court\nArticle Three, Section 1 of the Constitution provides that justices \"shall hold their offices during good behavior\", which is understood to mean that they may serve for the remainder of their lives, until death; furthermore, the phrase is generally interpreted to mean that the only way justices can be removed from office is by Congress via the impeachment process. The Framers of the Constitution chose good behavior tenure to limit the power to remove justices and to ensure judicial independence.[97][98][99] No constitutional mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, but unable (or unwilling) to resign.[100] The only justice ever to be impeached was Samuel Chase, in 1804. The House of Representatives adopted eight articles of impeachment against him; however, he was acquitted by the Senate, and remained in office until his death in 1811.[101] No subsequent effort to impeach a sitting justice has progressed beyond referral to the Judiciary Committee. (For example, William O. Douglas was the subject of hearings twice, in 1953 and again in 1970; and Abe Fortas resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969.)\n\n\nBecause justices have indefinite tenure, timing of vacancies can be unpredictable. Sometimes they arise in quick succession, as in September 1971, when Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II left within days of each other, the shortest period of time between vacancies in the court's history.[102] Sometimes a great length of time passes between vacancies, such as the 11-year span, from 1994 to 2005, from the retirement of Harry Blackmun to the death of William Rehnquist, which was the second longest timespan between vacancies in the court's history.[103] On average a new justice joins the court about every two years.[104]\n\n\nDespite the variability, all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, although his successor (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.\n\n\n\n### Size of the court[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court consists of nine members: one chief justice and eight associate justices. The U.S. Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court, nor does it specify any specific positions for the court's members. However, the Constitution assumes the existence of the office of the chief justice, because it mentions in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 that \"the Chief Justice\" must preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States. The power to define the Supreme Court's size and membership has been assumed to belong to Congress, which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\n\nThe size of the court was first altered by the Midnight Judges Act of 1801 which would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy (as federal judges have life tenure), but the Judiciary Act of 1802 promptly negated the 1801 act, restoring the court's size to six members before any such vacancy occurred. As the nation's boundaries grew across the continent and as Supreme Court justices in those days had to ride the circuit, an arduous process requiring long travel on horseback or carriage over harsh terrain that resulted in months-long extended stays away from home, Congress added justices to correspond with the growth such that the number of seats for associate justices plus the chief justice became seven in 1807, nine in 1837, and ten in 1863.[105][106]\n\n\nAt the behest of Chief Justice Chase and in an attempt by the Republican Congress to limit the power of Democrat Andrew Johnson, Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866, providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced, which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. Soon after Johnson left office, the new president Ulysses S. Grant,[107] a Republican, signed into law the Judiciary Act of 1869. This returned the number of justices to nine[108] (where it has since remained), and allowed Grant to immediately appoint two more judges.\n\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937. His proposal envisioned the appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70\u00a0years 6\u00a0months and refused retirement, up to a maximum bench of 15 justices. The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges, but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to \"pack\" the court with justices who would support Roosevelt's New Deal.[109] The plan, usually called the \"court-packing plan\", failed in Congress after members of Roosevelt's own Democratic Party believed it to be unconstitutional. It was defeated 70\u201320 in the Senate, and the Senate Judiciary Committee reported that it was \"essential to the continuance of our constitutional democracy\" that the proposal \"be so emphatically rejected that its parallel will never again be presented to the free representatives of the free people of America.\"[110][111][112][113]\n\n\nThe rise and solidification of a conservative majority on the court during the presidency of Donald Trump sparked a liberal response in the form of calls for court-packing. Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced a bill in April 2021 to expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 seats, but Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to bring it to the floor and relatively few Democrats backed it.[114][115] Shortly after taking office in January 2021, Joe Biden established a presidential commission to study possible reforms to the Supreme Court. The commission's December 2021 final report discussed but took no position on expanding the size of the court.[116] It remains unclear whether it would be constitutional to expand the size of the Supreme Court in ways understood to be designed to \"pack\" it with justices that would rule more favorably on a president's agenda or to simply change the ideological composition of the court.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Membership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n### Current justices[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices. Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 11,922 days (32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days) as of June 13, 2024; the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the senate on April 7.[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent justices of the Supreme Court[120]\n| Justice /birthdate and place\n | Appointed by (party)\n | SCV | Age at\n | Start date /length of service\n | Succeeded\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Start | Present\n |\n| ![](image) | (Chief Justice)**John Roberts**January 27, 1955Buffalo, New York | G.

Among the nine justices, there are two African American justices (Justices Thomas and Jackson) and one Hispanic justice (Justice Sotomayor). One of the justices was born to at least one immigrant parent: Justice Alito's father was born in Italy.[121][122]\n\n\nAt least six justices are Roman Catholics, one is Jewish, and one is Protestant. It is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[123] Historically, most justices have been Protestants, including 36 Episcopalians, 19 Presbyterians, 10 Unitarians, 5 Methodists, and 3 Baptists.[124][125] The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836,[126] and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice, Louis Brandeis.[127] In recent years the historical situation has reversed, as most recent justices have been either Catholic or Jewish.\n\n\nThree justices are from the state of New York, two are from Washington, D.C., and one each is from New Jersey, Georgia, Colorado, and Louisiana.[128][129][130] Eight of the current justices received their Juris Doctor from an Ivy League law school: Neil Gorsuch, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and John Roberts from Harvard; plus Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas from Yale. Only Amy Coney Barrett did not; she received her Juris Doctor at Notre Dame.\n\n\nPrevious positions or offices, judicial or federal government, prior to joining the court (by order of seniority following the Chief Justice) include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Justice\n | Position or office\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| John Roberts | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2003\u20132005)\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (1982\u20131990)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1990\u20131991)\n |\n| Samuel Alito | United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey (1987\u20131990)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (1990\u20132006)\n |\n| Sonia Sotomayor | Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (1992\u20131998)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1998\u20132009)\n |\n| Elena Kagan | Solicitor General of the United States (2009\u20132010)\n |\n| Neil Gorsuch | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006\u20132017)\n |\n| Brett Kavanaugh | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2006\u20132018)\n |\n| Amy Coney Barrett | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (2017\u20132020)\n |\n| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Vice Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission (2010\u20132014)Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (2013\u20132021)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2021\u20132022)\n |\n\n\n![](image)The first four female justices: O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan\nFor much of the court's history, every justice was a man of Northwestern European descent, and almost always Protestant. Diversity concerns focused on geography, to represent all regions of the country, rather than religious, ethnic, or gender diversity.[131] Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the court increased in the late 20th century. Thurgood Marshall became the first African-American justice in 1967.[127] Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female justice in 1981.[127] In 1986, Antonin Scalia became the first Italian-American justice. Marshall was succeeded by African-American Clarence Thomas in 1991.[132] O'Connor was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first Jewish woman on the Court, in 1993.[133] After O'Connor's retirement Ginsburg was joined in 2009 by Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic and Latina justice,[127] and in 2010 by Elena Kagan.[133] After Ginsburg's death on September 18, 2020, Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as the fifth woman in the court's history on October 26, 2020. Ketanji Brown Jackson is the sixth woman and first African-American woman on the court.\n\n\nThere have been six foreign-born justices in the court's history: James Wilson (1789\u20131798), born in Caskardy, Scotland; James Iredell (1790\u20131799), born in Lewes, England; William Paterson (1793\u20131806), born in County Antrim, Ireland; David Brewer (1889\u20131910), born to American missionaries in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire (now Izmir, Turkey); George Sutherland (1922\u20131939), born in Buckinghamshire, England; and Felix Frankfurter (1939\u20131962), born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now in Austria).[127]\n\n\nSince 1789, about one-third of the justices have been U.S. military veterans. Samuel Alito is the only veteran currently serving on the court.[134] Retired justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy also served in the U.S. military.[135]\n\n\n\n### Retired justices[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently four living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer. As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts, usually the United States Courts of Appeals. Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice, on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice. In recent years, Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit, the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court; and Justice O'Connor often sat with several Courts of Appeal before withdrawing from public life in 2018.[136] The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status, and eligibility of a Supreme Court justice to assume retired status (rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service criteria.\n\n\nIn recent times, justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal, institutional, ideological, partisan, and sometimes even political factors playing a role.[137][138] The fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down. The desire to maximize the court's strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time, when the court is in recess and during non-presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health. Finally, especially in recent decades, many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office, to ensure that a like-minded successor would be appointed.[139][140]\n\n\n\n\n\nRetired justices of the Supreme Court[120]\n| JusticeBirthdate and place\n | Appointed by\n | Age at\n | Tenure (active service)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Retirement | Present | Start date | End date | Length\n |\n| ![](image) | Sandra Day O'ConnorMarch 26, 1930El Paso, Texas |  Reagan(R)\n | 75\n | 94\n | September 25, 1981 | January 31, 2006 | 24\u00a0years, 128\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | Anthony KennedyJuly 23, 1936Sacramento, California |  Reagan(R)\n | 82\n | 87\n | February 18, 1988 | July 31, 2018 | 30\u00a0years, 163\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | David SouterSeptember 17, 1939Melrose, Massachusetts | G.

Back row (left to right): Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nFor the most part, the day-to-day activities of the justices are governed by rules of protocol based upon the seniority of justices. The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence\u2014regardless of the length of their service. The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service. The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences. The other justices are seated in order of seniority. The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left. The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat. Therefore, since the October 2022 term, the court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the court: Barrett, Gorsuch, Sotomayor, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Jackson. Likewise, when the members of the court gather for official group photographs, justices are arranged in order of seniority, with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions, and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions.\n\n\nIn the justices' private conferences, current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority, beginning with the chief justice first and ending with the most junior associate justice. By custom, the most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone, such as answering the door of their conference room, serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk.[141]\n\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal judge salaries in the United States\n\nAs of 2021, associate justices receive a yearly salary of $268,300 and the chief justice is paid $280,500 per year.[142] Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices. Once a justice meets age and service requirements, the justice may retire. Judicial pensions are based on the same formula used for federal employees, but a justice's pension, as with other federal courts judges, can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Judicial leanings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices\n\nAlthough justices are nominated by the president in power, and receive confirmation by the Senate, justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches. Jurists are informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives, moderates, or liberals. Such leanings generally refer to a legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one. The nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the legislative branch who vote their approval[*clarification needed*] or disapproval of the nominated justice. The ideologies of jurists can be measured and compared with several metrics, including the Segal\u2013Cover score, Martin-Quinn score, and Judicial Common Space score.[143][144]\n\n\nSince the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court has had six justices appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by Democratic presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, appointed by Republican presidents, compose the court's conservative wing, and that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson, appointed by Democratic presidents, compose the court's liberal wing.[145] Kavanaugh was considered one of the most conservative judges in the DC Circuit prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court.[146][147] Likewise, Barrett's brief track record on the Seventh Circuit is conservative.[148]\nPrior to Justice Ginsburg's death, Chief Justice Roberts was considered the court's median justice (with four justices more liberal and four more conservative than him), making him the ideological center of the conservative court.[149][150] Since Ginsburg's death and Barrett's confirmation, Kavanaugh has been described as the median justice of this more conservative court, based on the criterion that he has been in the majority more than any other justice.[151]\n\n\nTom Goldstein argued in an article in *SCOTUSblog* in 2010, that the popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is \"in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions.\"[152] He pointed out that in the 2009 term, almost half the cases were decided unanimously, and only about 20% were decided by a 5-to-4 vote. Barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal/conservative divide (fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included). He also pointed to several cases that defied the popular conception of the ideological lines of the court.[153]\nGoldstein further argued that the large number of pro-criminal-defendant summary dismissals (usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument) were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological. Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of cases decided unanimously and by a one-vote margin from 1971 to 2016\nAccording to statistics compiled by *SCOTUSblog*, in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011, an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues (22%) were decided by a 5\u20134 vote, with an average of 70% of those split opinions decided by a court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines (about 15% of all opinions issued). Over that period, the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62% of the time that the court has divided along ideological lines, which represents about 44% of all the 5\u20134 decisions.[154]\n\n\nIn the October 2010 term, the court decided 86 cases, including 75 signed opinions and 5 summary reversals (where the court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case).[155][156] Four were decided with unsigned opinions, two cases affirmed by an equally divided Court, and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted. Justice Kagan recused herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as United States Solicitor General. Of the 80 cases, 38 (about 48%, the highest percentage since the October 2005 term) were decided unanimously (9\u20130 or 8\u20130), and 16 decisions were made by a 5\u20134 vote (about 20%, compared to 18% in the October 2009 term, and 29% in the October 2008 term).[157] However, in fourteen of the sixteen 5\u20134 decisions, the court divided along the traditional ideological lines (with Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan on the liberal side, and Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on the conservative, and Kennedy providing the \"swing vote\"). This represents 87% of those 16 cases, the highest rate in the past 10 years. The conservative bloc, joined by Kennedy, formed the majority in 63% of the 5\u20134 decisions, the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the Roberts Court.[155][158]\n\n\nThe October 2017 term had a low rate of unanimous rulings, with only 39% of the cases decided by unanimous rulings, the lowest percentage since the October 2008 term when 30% of rulings were unanimous.[159] Chief Justice Roberts was in the majority most often (68 out of 73 cases, or 93.2%), with retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in second (67 out of 73 cases, or 91.8%); this was typical of the Roberts Court, in which Roberts and Kennedy have been in the majority most frequently in all terms except for the 2013 and 2014 terms (though Kennedy was in the top on both those terms).[160] Justice Sotomayor was the justice least likely to be in the majority (in 50 out of 73 cases, or 68.5%). The highest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who agreed on 95.8% of the cases, followed by Thomas and Alito agreeing on 93% of cases. There were 19 cases that were decided by a 5\u20134 vote (26% of the total cases); 74% of those cases (14 out of 19) broke along ideological lines, and for the first time in the Roberts Court, all of those resulted in a conservative majority, with Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch on the majority.[160]\n\n\nThe October 2018 term, which saw the replacement of Anthony Kennedy by Brett Kavanaugh, once again saw a low rate of unanimity: only 28 of 71 decided cases were decided by a unanimous court, about 39% of the cases.[161][162] Of these, only 19 cases had the justices in total agreement. Chief Justice Roberts was once again the justice most often in the majority (61 out of 72 cases, or 85% of the time). Although Kavanaugh had a higher percentage of times in the majority, he did not participate in all cases, voting in the majority 58 out of 64 times, or 91% of the cases in which he participated. Of the justices who participated in all 72 cases, Kagan and Alito tied in second place, voting in the majority 59 out of 72 times (or 82% of the time). Looking only at cases that were not decided unanimously, Roberts and Kavanaugh were the most frequently in the majority (33 cases, with Roberts being in the majority in 75% of the divided cases, and Kavanaugh in 85% of the divided cases he participated in). Of 20 cases that were decided by a vote of 5\u20134, eight featured the conservative justices in the majority (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh), and eight had the liberal justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) joined by a conservative: Gorsuch was the most frequent, joining them four times, and the remaining conservative justices joining the liberals once each. The remaining four cases were decided by different coalitions.[162] The highest agreement between justices was between Roberts and Kavanaugh, who agreed at least in judgement 94% of the time; the second highest agreement was again between Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who agreed 93% of the time. The highest rate of full agreement was between Ginsburg and Kagan (82% of the time), closely followed by Roberts and Alito, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, and Breyer and Kagan (81% of the time). The largest rate of disagreement was between Thomas and both Ginsburg and Sotomayor; Thomas disagreed with each of them 50% of the time.[162]\n\n\nBy the completion of the 2021 term, the percent of 6\u20133 decisions favoring the conservative majority had reached 30%, with the percent of unanimous cases having dropped to the same number.[163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Supreme Court Building\n\n![](image)The present U.S. Supreme Court building as viewed from the front\n![](image)From the 1860s until the 1930s, the court sat in the Old Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol.\nThe Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City. When Philadelphia became the capital, the court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the court occupied various spaces in the Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own Supreme Court Police, separate from the Capitol Police.[164]\n\n\nLocated across First Street from the United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue,[165][166] the building is open to the public from 9\u00a0am to 4:30\u00a0pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays.[165] Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied. There is a cafeteria, a gift shop, exhibits, and a half-hour informational film.[164] When the court is not in session, lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9:30\u00a0am to 3:30\u00a0pm and reservations are not necessary.[164] When the court is in session the public may attend oral arguments, which are held twice each morning (and sometimes afternoons) on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals from October through late April, with breaks during December and February. Visitors are seated on a first-come first-served basis. One estimate is there are about 250 seats available.[167] The number of open seats varies from case to case; for important cases, some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night. The court releases opinions beginning at 10\u00a0am on scheduled \"non-argument days\" (also called opinion days) listed on a calendar at the court's homepage.[168] These sessions, which typically last 15 to 30-minute, are also open to the public.[168][164] From mid-May until the end of June, at least one opinion day is scheduled each week.[164] Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions.[165]\n\n\n\n## Jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Constitutional lawof the United States |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| \nOverview |\n| * Articles\n* Amendments\n* History\n* Judicial review\n |\n| \nPrinciples |\n| * Separation of powers\n* Individual rights\n* Rule of law\n* Federalism\n* Republicanism\n* Equal footing\n* Strict scrutiny\n |\n| \nGovernment structure |\n| * Legislative branch\n* Executive branch\n* Judicial branch\n* State government\n* Local government\n |\n| \nIndividual rights |\n| * Freedom of religion\n* Freedom of speech\n* Freedom of the press\n* Freedom of assembly\n* Right to petition\n* Freedom of association\n* Right to keep and bear arms\n* Right to trial by jury\n* Criminal procedural rights\n* Right to privacy\n* Freedom from slavery\n* Due process\n* Equal protection\n* Citizenship\n* Voting rights\n* Right to candidacy\n* Comprehensible rules\n |\n| \nTheory |\n| * Living Constitution\n* Originalism\n* Substantive due process\n* Political process theory\n* Purposivism\n* Textualism\n* Strict constructionism\n* Common good constitutionalism\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nCongress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states[169] but may decline to hear such cases.[170] It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear \"all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all controversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.\"[171]\n\n\nIn 1906, the court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in *United States v. Shipp*.[172] The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the court's history.[173][174] The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga, Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal. Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob, aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded, and hanged from a bridge, after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson's body reading: \"To Justice Harlan. Come get your nigger now.\"[173] The local sheriff, John Shipp, cited the Supreme Court's intervention as the rationale for the lynching. The court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices, who found nine individuals guilty of contempt, sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail.[173][174][175] In all other cases, the court has only appellate jurisdiction, including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states.[176]\n\n\nThe court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal (through *certiorari*, certiorari before judgment, and certified questions),[177] the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (through certiorari),[178] the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (through *certiorari*),[179] the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (through *certiorari*),[180] the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (through *certiorari*),[181] and \"final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" (through *certiorari*).[181] In the last case, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal. For example, a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court if (a) the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant *certiorari*, e.g. *Florida Star v. B. J. F.*, or (b) the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court's decision without discussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions.[182] The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court's history, by its rulings in *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee* (1816) and *Cohens v. Virginia* (1821). The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-called \"collateral review\" of state cases. It has to be noted that this \"collateral review\" often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system.[183]\n\n\nSince Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain \"cases\" or \"controversies\", the Supreme Court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For example, in *DeFunis v. Odegaard*, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered. However, the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot. If an issue is \"capable of repetition yet evading review\", the court would address it even though the party before the court would not themselves be made whole by a favorable result. In *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and other abortion cases, the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct, in which the court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.[184]\n\n\n\n### Justices as circuit justices[edit]\n\n\nThe United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals, each of which is assigned a \"circuit justice\" from the Supreme Court. Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each justice was required to \"ride circuit\", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges. This practice encountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel. Moreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit. Circuit riding ended in 1901, when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed, and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911.[185]\n\n\nThe circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that, by law and the rules of the court, may be addressed by a single justice. Ordinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it \"granted\" or \"denied\" or entering a standard form of order; however, the justice may elect to write an opinion, referred to as an in-chambers opinion. Congress has specifically authorized one justice to issue a stay pending certiorari in 28 U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02101(f). Each justice also decides routine procedural requests, such as for extensions of time.\n\n\nBefore 1990, the rules of the Supreme Court also stated that \"a writ of injunction may be granted by any Justice in a case where it might be granted by the Court.\"[186] However, this part of the rule (and all other specific mention of injunctions) was removed in the Supreme Court's rules revision of December 1989.[187][188] Nevertheless, requests for injunctions under the All Writs Act are sometimes directed to the circuit justice. In the past,[*when?*] circuit justices also sometimes granted motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of *habeas corpus*, and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal.[189]\n\n\nA circuit justice may sit as a judge on the Court of Appeals of that circuit, but over the past hundred years, this has rarely occurred. A circuit justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit.[190] The chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit, the Fourth Circuit (which includes Maryland and Virginia, the states surrounding the District of Columbia), and since it was established, the Federal Circuit. Each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits.\n\n\nAs of September 28, 2022, the allotment of the justices among the circuits is as follows:[191]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Circuit | Justice\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| District of Columbia Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n| First Circuit | Justice Jackson |\n| Second Circuit | Justice Sotomayor |\n| Third Circuit | Justice Alito |\n| Fourth Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n| Fifth Circuit | Justice Alito |\n| Sixth Circuit | Justice Kavanaugh |\n| Seventh Circuit | Justice Barrett |\n| Eighth Circuit | Justice Kavanaugh |\n| Ninth Circuit | Justice Kagan |\n| Tenth Circuit | Justice Gorsuch |\n| Eleventh Circuit | Justice Thomas |\n| Federal Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n\n\n\nFive of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C. Circuit), Justice Sotomayor (Second Circuit), Justice Alito (Third Circuit), Justice Barrett (Seventh Circuit), and Justice Gorsuch (Tenth Circuit).\n\n\n\n## Process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n### Term[edit]\n\n\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and continues until June or early July of the following year. Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as \"sittings\" and \"recesses\"; justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings, and discuss cases and write opinions during recesses.[192]\n\n\n\n### Case selection[edit]\n\n\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of *certiorari*, commonly referred to as *cert*; the court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals \"by writ of *certiorari* granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case.\"[193] The court may also review \"final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had\" but only if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law.[194] The party that appealed to the court is the *petitioner* and the non-mover is the *respondent*. All case names before the court are styled *petitioner* v. *respondent*, regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court. For example, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual, as in *State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda*. If the defendant is convicted, and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court, when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes *Miranda v. Arizona*.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court relies on the record assembled by lower courts for the facts of a case and deals solely with the question of how the law applies to the facts presented. There are however situations where the court has original jurisdiction, such as when two states have a dispute against each other, or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include *United States v. Texas*, a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and *Virginia v. Tennessee*, a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of *Georgia v. Brailsford*,[195] parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact.[196] *Georgia v. Brailsford* remains the only case in which the court has empaneled a jury, in this case a special jury.[197] Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in *New Jersey v. Delaware*, and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in *Kansas v. Colorado*.\n\n\nA cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called conference. A conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves; the public and the justices' clerks are excluded. The rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of *certiorari*. If it is granted, the case proceeds to the briefing stage; otherwise, the case ends. Except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the court orders briefing from the respondent, the respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the cert petition. The court grants a petition for cert only for \"compelling reasons\", spelled out in the court's Rule 10. Such reasons include:\n\n\n\n* Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution\n* Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings\n* Resolving an important question of federal law, or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the court.\n\n\nWhen a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals, lawyers call this situation a \"circuit split\"; if the court votes to deny a cert petition, as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it, it does so typically without comment. A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case, and the decision of the lower court stands as the case's final ruling. To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the court each year (of the more than 7,000 petitions the court receives each year, it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer), the court employs an internal case management tool known as the \"cert pool\"; currently, all justices except for Justices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n### Oral argument[edit]\n\n\n![A man speaking at a lectern before two supreme court justices.](image)Seth P. Waxman at oral argument presents his case and answers questions from the justices.\nWhen the court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument. Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition. With the consent of the parties or approval of the court, *amici curiae*, or \"friends of the court\", may also file briefs. The court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the court may choose to give more time, although this is rare),[202] and during that time, the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. In 2019, the court adopted a rule generally allowing advocates to speak uninterrupted for the first two minutes of their argument.[203] The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded. *Amici curiae* may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees. The court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court bar[edit]\n\n\nIn order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the court's bar. Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year. The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members. In reality, pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys.[*citation needed*] The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, earning the court about $750,000 annually. Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups. The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys.[204] Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume. They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument.[205] Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library.[206]\n\n\n\n### Decision[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision. Cases are decided by majority vote of the justices. After the oral argument is concluded, usually in the same week as the case was submitted, the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the court sees which side has prevailed. One of the justices in the majority is then assigned to write the court's opinion, also known as the \"majority opinion\", an assignment made by the most senior justice in the majority, with the chief justice always being considered the most senior. Drafts of the court's opinion circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case.[207]\n\n\nJustices are free to change their votes on a case up until the decision is finalized and published. In any given case, a justice is free to choose whether or not to author an opinion or else simply join the majority or another justice's opinion. There are several primary types of opinions:\n\n\n\n* **Opinion of the court**: this is the binding decision of the Supreme Court. An opinion that more than half of the justices join (usually at least five justices, since there are nine justices in total; but in cases where some justices do not participate it could be fewer) is known as \"majority opinion\" and creates binding precedent in American law. Whereas an opinion that fewer than half of the justices join is known as a \"plurality opinion\" and is only partially binding precedent.\n* **Concurring**: a justice agrees with and joins the majority opinion but authors a separate concurrence to give additional explanations, rationales, or commentary. Concurrences do not create binding precedent.\n* **Concurring in the judgment**: a justice agrees with the outcome the court reached but disagrees with its reasons for doing so. A justice in this situation does not join the majority opinion. Like regular concurrences, these do not create binding precedent.\n* **Dissent**: a justice disagrees with the outcome the court reached and its reasoning. Justices who dissent from a decision may author their own dissenting opinions or, if there are multiple dissenting justices in a decision, may join another justice's dissent. Dissents do not create binding precedent. A justice may also join only part(s) of a particular decision, and may even agree with some parts of the outcome and disagree with others.\n\n\nIt is the court's practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term. Within that term, the court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument. Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the Supreme Court Building, the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper copies and is known as the \"Running of the Interns\".[208]\n\n\nIt is possible that through recusals or vacancies the court divides evenly on a case. If that occurs, then the decision of the court below is affirmed, but does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it results in a return to the *status quo ante*. For a case to be heard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices.[209] If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the court had been evenly divided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court, the chief justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there.[210] This has only occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of *United States v. Alcoa* (1945).[211]\n\n\n\n### Published opinions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(August 2021)*\n |\n\n\nThe court's opinions are published in three stages. First, a slip opinion is made available on the court's web site and through other outlets. Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of *United States Reports*, the official series of books in which the final version of the court's opinions appears. About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of *U.S. Reports* is issued by the Reporter of Decisions. The individual volumes of *U.S. Reports* are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports (or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations) to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily. As of January\u00a02019[update], there are:\n\n\n\n* Final bound volumes of *U.S. Reports*: 569 volumes, covering cases through June 13, 2013 (part of the October 2012 term).[212][213]\n* Slip opinions: 21 volumes (565\u2013585 for 2011\u20132017 terms, three two-part volumes each), plus part 1 of volume 586 (2018 term).[214]\n\n\nAs of March\u00a02012[update], the *U.S. Reports* have published a total of 30,161 Supreme Court opinions, covering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March 2012.[*citation needed*] This figure does not reflect the number of cases the court has taken up, as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion (see, for example, *Parents v. Seattle*, where *Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education* was also decided in the same opinion; by a similar logic, *Miranda v. Arizona* actually decided not only *Miranda* but also three other cases: *Vignera v. New York*, *Westover v. United States*, and *California v. Stewart*). A more unusual example is The Telephone Cases, which are a single set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the *U.S. Reports*.\n\n\nOpinions are also collected and published in two unofficial, parallel reporters: *Supreme Court Reporter*, published by West (now a part of Thomson Reuters), and *United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition* (simply known as *Lawyers' Edition*), published by LexisNexis. In court documents, legal periodicals and other legal media, case citations generally contain cites from each of the three reporters; for example, citation to *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* is presented as *Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n*, 585 U.S. 50, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), with \"S. Ct.\" representing the *Supreme Court Reporter*, and \"L. Ed.\" representing the *Lawyers' Edition*.[215][216]\n\n\n\n#### Citations to published opinions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Case citation \u00a7\u00a0Supreme Court of the United States\n\nLawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form \"vol U.S. page, pin (year)\", where vol is the volume number, page is the page number on which the opinion begins, and year is the year in which the case was decided. Optionally, pin is used to \"pinpoint\" to a specific page number within the opinion. For instance, the citation for *Roe v. Wade* is 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of *U.S. Reports*. For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print, the volume and page numbers may be replaced with *\\_\\_\\_*\n\n\n\n## Institutional powers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from *Marbury v. Madison*, in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of judicial review\nThe federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, in fact, is nowhere mentioned in it. Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way.[217] Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent. Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, and the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\"\n\n\nThe Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in *Marbury v. Madison* (1803), consummating the American system of checks and balances. In explaining the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts, part of the *duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.* His contention was not that the court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements, but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary, as well as the other branches of government, to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution.[217]\n\n\nSince the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism, self-government, self-determination and freedom of conscience. At one pole are those who view the federal judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being \"the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.\"[218] Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure \"during good behavior\", and their pay may \"not be diminished\" while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article Three). Although subject to the process of impeachment, only one justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government.[217]\n\n\n\n### Constraints[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in *Worcester v. Georgia*. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"[219] Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment *Brown v. Board of Education*. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the court's order in *United States v. Nixon* (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes.[220] Nixon ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.[221]\n\n\nSupreme Court decisions can be purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment, something that has happened on six occasions:\n\n\n\n* *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793) \u2013 overturned by the Eleventh Amendment (1795)\n* *Dred Scott v. Sandford* (1857) \u2013 overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868)\n* *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.* (1895) \u2013 overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment (1913)\n* *Minor v. Happersett* (1875) \u2013 overturned by the Nineteenth Amendment (1920)\n* *Breedlove v. Suttles* (1937) \u2013 overturned by the Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964)\n* *Oregon v. Mitchell* (1970) \u2013 overturned by the Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971)\n\n\nWhen the court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution, simple legislative action can reverse the decisions (for example, in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, superseding the limitations given in *Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.* in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration: lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement officials.[222]\n\n\nIn addition, the other two branches can restrain the court through other mechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving the president power to influence future decisions by appointments (as in Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan discussed above). Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases: this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three, where the appellate jurisdiction is granted \"with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\" The court sanctioned such congressional action in the Reconstruction Era case *ex parte McCardle* (1869), although it rejected Congress' power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in *United States v. Klein* (1871).\n\n\nOn the other hand, through its power of judicial review, the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government; for example, in *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936), *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), and notably in *Goldwater v. Carter* (1979), which effectively gave the presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress. The court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority, as in *Humphrey's Executor v. United States* (1935), the *Steel Seizure Case* (1952), and *United States v. Nixon* (1974).\n\n\n\n## Law clerks[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lists of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nEach Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of *certiorari*, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions. Associate justices are allowed four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four.[223] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.\n\n\nThe first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice Horace Gray in 1882.[223][224] Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis were the first Supreme Court justices to use recent law school graduates as clerks, rather than hiring \"a stenographer-secretary.\"[225] Most law clerks are recent law school graduates.\n\n\nThe first female clerk was Lucile Lomen, hired in 1944 by Justice William O. Douglas.[223] The first African-American, William T. Coleman Jr., was hired in 1948 by Justice Felix Frankfurter.[223] A disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools, especially Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, Columbia, and Stanford. From 1882 to 1940, 62% of law clerks were graduates of Harvard Law School.[223] Those chosen to be Supreme Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the moot court board. By the mid-1970s, clerking previously for a judge in a federal court of appeals had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court justice.\n\n\nTen Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices: Byron White for Frederick M. Vinson, John Paul Stevens for Wiley Rutledge, William Rehnquist for Robert H. Jackson, Stephen Breyer for Arthur Goldberg, John Roberts for William Rehnquist, Elena Kagan for Thurgood Marshall, Neil Gorsuch for both Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, Brett Kavanaugh also for Kennedy, Amy Coney Barrett for Antonin Scalia, and Ketanji Brown Jackson for Stephen Breyer. Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh served under Kennedy during the same term. Gorsuch is the first justice to clerk for and subsequently serve alongside the same justice, serving alongside Kennedy from April 2017 through Kennedy's retirement in 2018. With the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, for the first time a majority of the Supreme Court was composed of former Supreme Court law clerks (Roberts, Breyer, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, now joined by Barrett and Jackson).\n\n\nSeveral current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals: John Roberts for Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Justice Samuel Alito for Judge Leonard I. Garth of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Elena Kagan for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Neil Gorsuch for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Brett Kavanaugh for Judge Walter Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and Amy Coney Barrett for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\n\n\n### Politicization of the court[edit]\n\n\nClerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft. \"Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s,\" according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School.[226][227] \"As law has moved closer to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts,\" former federal court of appeals judge J. Michael Luttig said.[226] David J. Garrow, professor of history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government. \"We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives,\" Professor Garrow said. \"Each side is putting forward only ideological purists.\"[226]\n\n\nAccording to the *Vanderbilt Law Review* study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is \"a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law.\"[226] A poll conducted in June 2012 by *The New York Times* and CBS News showed just 44% of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Three-quarters said justices' decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views.[228] One study, using four-year panel data, found that public opinion of the Supreme Court was highly stable over time.[229] In 2023 a Gallup poll found that trust in the Supreme Court was at a historic low of 47%, the previous lowest rating was 53%.[230]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has been the object of criticisms and controversies on a range of issues. Among them:\n\n\n\n### Democratic backsliding[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic backsliding in the United States\n\nThomas Keck argues that the US Supreme Court has rarely provided an effective check against democratic abuses, especially at five major constitutional crises throughout US history, and finds signs that the Roberts Court plays a more damaging role than most of its predecessors in undermining (maybe permanently) American democracy.[231] Aziz Z. Huq points to the blocking progress of democratizing institutions, increasing the disparity in wealth and power, and empowering an authoritarian white nationalist movement, as evidence that the Supreme Court has created a \"permanent minority\" incapable of democratic defeat.[232]\n\n\n\n### Ethics[edit]\n\n\nEthical controversies have grown with reports of justices (and their close family members) accepting expensive gifts, travel, business deals, and speaking fees without oversight or recusals from cases that present conflicts of interest.[233][234][235][236][237][238][239] Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices' ethical disclosure forms[240] while justices, such as Clarence Thomas, failed to disclose many large financial gifts including a free vacation valued at $500,000.[241]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2023, the court issued its first-ever Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to set \"ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court.\"[242][243] The Code has done little to dampen the ethics concerns for notable critics who found the Code relatively weaker than those for federal judges, the legislature and the executive branch while also lacking an enforcement mechanism.[244][245][246] The court denied past wrongdoing by saying that they have largely abided by these principles and are simply publishing them now.[247][248][249] Ian Millhiser of Vox views the code as a setback for ethics reform, saying it denies and seeks to legitimize past and future scandals.[250]\n\n\n\n#### Lack of accountability[edit]\n\n\nThe ethics rules guiding the court's members are set and enforced by the justices, meaning the members of the court have no external checks on their behavior other than the impeachment of a justice by Congress.[251][252] Chief Justice Roberts refused to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April 2023, reasserting his desire for the Supreme Court to continue to monitor itself despite mounting ethics scandals.[253] Lower courts, by contrast, discipline according to the 1973 Code of Conduct for U.S. judges which is enforced by the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980.[251] The lack of external enforcement of ethics or other conduct violations makes the Supreme Court an outlier in modern organizational best-practices.[251]\n\n\n\n### Increasing partisanship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike constitutional courts in most democracies and contrary to the ideal taught in civics classes, the U.S. Supreme Court appears to be an increasingly partisan institution.[254][255] The partisan refusal to act on the nomination of Merrick Garland, citing a presidential election that was eight months away, together with the same partisan majority expediting the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett held less than 2 months before the 2020 presidential election four years later, showed that the Senate deems the institution to be of partisan importance.[255] Further evidence of partisanship can be found in the sinking confidence ratings for the Court among Independents (25%) and Democrats (13%) in the 2022 Gallup poll.[256] Lastly, FiveThirtyEight found the number of unanimous decisions dropped from the 20-year average of nearly 50% to nearly 30% in 2021 while party-line rulings increased from a 60-year average just above zero to a record high 21%.[257]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\nSome of the most notable decisions that were criticized for failing to protect individual rights include the *Dred Scott* (1857) decision that upheld slavery[258] and *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896) that upheld segregation under the doctrine of *separate but equal.*[259] The upholding of voter ID laws has received criticism as a subtler method of disenfranchising poor and minority voters.[260] Senator Al Franken criticized the court for \"eroding individual rights.\"[261] *Kelo v. City of New London* (2005) received criticism from some as undermining property rights.[262][263] However, others argue that the court is *too protective* of some individual rights, particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention. For example, Chief Justice Warren Burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule, and Justice Scalia criticized the court's decision in *Boumediene v. Bush* for being *too protective* of the rights of Guantanamo detainees, on the grounds that habeas corpus was \"limited\" to sovereign territory.[264]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology.[265] An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in *Lochner v. New York*, which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts,[265][266] and which was reversed in the 1930s.[267][268][269]\n\n\nAn often cited example of liberal judicial activism is *Roe v. Wade* (1973), which legalized abortion on the basis of the \"right to privacy\" inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous,[265] and the case was overturned by *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022). Legal scholars,[270][271] justices,[272] and presidential candidates[273] have criticized the Roe decision.\n\n\nThe reasoning of *Brown v. Board of Education*, banning racial segregation in public schools, has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan,[274] former associate justice nominee and solicitor general Robert Bork[275] and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater.[276]\n\n\nMore recently, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in *First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti* (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations.[277] President Abraham Lincoln warned, referring to the *Dred Scott* decision, that if government policy became \"irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\"[278] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: \"You do what you think is right and let the law catch up.\"[279]\n\n\nDuring different historical periods, the court has leaned in different directions.[280][281] Critics from both sides complain that activist judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead.[282][283][284] Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano,[285] Phyllis Schlafly,[286] Mark R. Levin,[287] Mark I. Sutherland,[288] and James MacGregor Burns.[289][290] Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.[291][292] Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: \"What judges have wrought is a coup d'\u00e9tat,\u2013 slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'\u00e9tat nonetheless.\"[293] Brian Leiter wrote that \"Given the complexity of the law and the complexity involved in saying what really happened in a given dispute, all judges, and especially those on the Supreme Court, often have to exercise a quasi-legislative power\", and \"Supreme Court nominations are controversial because the court is a super-legislature, and because its moral and political judgments are controversial.\"[294]\n\n\n\n### Lifetime tenure[edit]\n\n\nLifetime tenure of justices can only be found for US Supreme Court Justices and the State of Rhode Island's Supreme Court justices, with all other democratic nations and states favoring term limits.[295] Larry Sabato wrote: \"The insularity of lifetime tenure, combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench, produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day.\"[296] Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity.[297] James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has \"produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times.\"[289] Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices, as proposed by Levinson[298] and Sabato[296][299] and a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein,[300] among others.[301] However, others suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits, such as impartiality and freedom from political pressure. Alexander Hamilton in *Federalist 78* wrote \"nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office.\"[302]\n\n\n\n### Minority rule and selection biases[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate \u00a7\u00a0 Selection bias, and United States Electoral College \u00a7\u00a0 Criticism\n\nThe electoral college (which elects the President who nominates the justices) and the US Senate which confirms the justices, have selection biases that favor rural states that tend to vote Republican, resulting in a conservative Supreme Court.[303] For example, the three Trump appointees to the court were all nominated by a president who finished second in the popular vote and confirmed by Senators representing a minority of Americans.[304] In addition, Clarence Thomas' confirmation and Merrick Garland's blocked confirmation in 2016 were both decided by Senators representing a minority of Americans.[305] This has been critiqued as minority rule.[306][307]\n\n\nMoreover, the Federalist Society acted as a filter for judicial nominations during the Trump administration,[308] ensuring the latest conservative justices lean even further to the right.[303] 86% of judges Trump appointed to circuit courts and the Supreme Court were Federalist Society members.[309] David Litt critiques it as \"an attempt to impose rigid ideological dogma on a profession once known for intellectual freedom.\"[310]\n\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\nThis criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism. George Will wrote that the court has an increasingly central role in American governance.[311] Michael Waldman argued that no other country gives its Supreme Court as much power.[312] Warren E. Burger, before becoming Chief Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such \"unreviewable power\", it is likely to \"self-indulge itself\", and unlikely to \"engage in dispassionate analysis.\"[313] Larry Sabato wrote that the federal courts, and especially the Supreme Court, have excessive power.[296]\n\n\nSome members of congress considered the results from the 2021\u20132022 term a shift of government power into the Supreme Court, and a \"judicial coup\".[314][315] The 2021\u20132022 term of the court was the first full term following the appointment of three judges by Republican president Donald Trump \u2014 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 which created a six-strong conservative majority on the court. Subsequently, at the end of the term, the court issued a number of decisions that favored this conservative majority while significantly changing the landscape with respect to rights. These included *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* which overturned *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* in recognizing abortion is not a constitutional right, *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* which made public possession of guns a protected right under the Second Amendment, *Carson v. Makin* and *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* which both weakened the Establishment Clause separating church and state, and *West Virginia v. EPA* which weakened the power of executive branch agencies to interpret their congressional mandate.[316][317][318]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism debate[edit]\n\n\nThere has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power. While Framers such as James Madison[319] and Alexander Hamilton[320] argued in *The Federalist Papers* that their then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments,[321][322][323][324] others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers' wishes.[325] The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly grants \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\n\nThe court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority. One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce, but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce; and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce. For example, the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005.[326] Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress's power over interstate commerce was \"complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.\"[327] Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is \"quite broad\";[328] modern-day theorist Robert B. Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today.[327]\n\n\nAdvocates of states' rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the court, saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority. Justice Brandeis, in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference, suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy.[329] One critic wrote \"the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state, not federal, law.\"[330] Others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends \"protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level.\"[331] More recently, the issue of federal power is central in the prosecution of *Gamble v. United States*, which is examining the doctrine of \"separate sovereigns\", whereby a criminal defendant can be prosecuted by a state court and then by a federal court.[332][333]\n\n\n\n### Ruling on political questions[edit]\n\n\nSome Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government. The *Bush v. Gore* decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election, awarding George W. Bush the presidency over Al Gore, received scrutiny as political in part because it was a conservative court.[334][335][336][337][338][339][*excessive citations*] Another example are Court decisions on apportionment and re-districting: in *Baker v. Carr*, the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions; Justice Frankfurter in a \"scathing dissent\" argued against the court wading into so-called political questions.[340]\n\n\n\n### Secretive proceedings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Shadow docket and List of United States Supreme Court leaks\n\nThe court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view.[341][342] For example, the increasing use of a 'shadow docket' facilitates the court making decisions in secret without knowing how each Justice came to their decision.[343][344] A 2007 review of Jeffrey Toobin's book compared the Court to a cartel where its inner-workings are mostly unknown, arguing this lack of transparency reduces scrutiny which hurts ordinary Americans who know little about the nine extremely consequential Justices.[334] A 2010 poll found that 61% of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would \"be good for democracy\", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised.[345][346]\n\n\n\n### Too few cases[edit]\n\n\nSenator Arlen Specter argued the court should decide more cases.[261] Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court heard then was smaller than when he first joined the Supreme Court, but he also stated that he had not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case, nor did he believe his colleagues had changed their standards. He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s, at least in part, to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts.[347]\n\n\n\n### Too slow[edit]\n\n\nBritish constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to navigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened.[348][349] In contrast, various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions; for example, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged.\n\n\n\n### Too small[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States \u00a7\u00a0Size of the court\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is the smallest (9 justices) of any major nation and could be expanded without a constitutional amendment.[350] Some have argued that 9 justices is too small a number to represent the perspectives of more than 300 million people, and that the number of seats on the Supreme Court should be expanded, with Jonathan Turley advocating for 19 justices.[351][352]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Law portal\n\n\n* Judicial appointment history for United States federal courts\n* List of courts which publish audio or video of arguments\n* List of presidents of the United States by judicial appointments\n* Lists of United States Supreme Court cases\n* List of supreme courts by country\n* List of pending United States Supreme Court cases\n* Oyez Project\n* Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n### Selected landmark Supreme Court decisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of landmark court decisions in the United States\n\n* *Marbury v.

One byproduct of the increased [retirement benefit] provisions [in 1954], however has been a dramatic rise in the number of justices engaging in succession politics by trying to time their departures to coincide with a compatible president. The most recent departures have been partisan, some more blatantly than others, and have bolstered arguments to reform the process. A second byproduct has been an increase in justices staying on the Court past their ability to adequately contribute.\n140. **^** Stolzenberg, Ross M.; Lindgren, James (May 2010). \"Retirement and Death in Office of U.S. Supreme Court Justices\". *Demography*. **47** (2): 269\u2013298. doi:10.1353/dem.0.0100.

The Court's increasing business in the nation's capital following the Civil War made the circuit riding seem anachronistic and impractical and a slow shift away from the practice began. The Judiciary Act of 1869 established a separate circuit court judiciary. The justices retained nominal circuit riding duties until 1891 when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed. With the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress officially ended the practice.

Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\"[4] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[5][6]\n\n\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Justice\n | State[c] | Position\n | Succeeded\n | Date confirmed(Vote)\n | Tenure\n | Tenure length[d] | Nominated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | John Jay(1745\u20131829) | NY | ChiefJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 19, 1789\u2013June 29, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 253\u00a0days\n | George Washington |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | John Rutledge(1739\u20131800) | SC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 15, 1790[e]\u2013March 5, 1791(Resigned) | 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | William Cushing(1732\u20131810) | MA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013September 13, 1810(Died) | 20\u00a0years, 223\u00a0days\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | James Wilson(1742\u20131798) | PA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 5, 1789[e]\u2013August 21, 1798(Died) | 8\u00a0years, 320\u00a0days\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Blair(1732\u20131800) | VA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013October 25, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 265\u00a0days\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | James Iredell(1751\u20131799) | NC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | February 10, 1790(Acclamation)\n | May 12, 1790\u2013October 20, 1799(Died) | 9\u00a0years, 161\u00a0days\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Thomas Johnson(1732\u20131819) | MD | AssociateJustice | J.

This rule of precedences exists to this day, codified at Title 28, U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a04. The commissions of the first four associate justices bear the following dates: Rutledge, Sept.\u00a026, 1789; Cushing, Sept.\u00a027; Wilson, Sept.\u00a029; and Blair, Sept.\u00a030.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Recess appointment.

There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number. Additionally, the progression of U.S. presidents is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Law of the United States\n* List of courts of the United States\n* List of supreme courts by country\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Stathis, Stephen W.

While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United States.[6][7][8] Her nomination was controversial because the 2020 presidential election was only 38 days away and Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland during an election year in 2016.[9] The next month, the U.S.\u00a0Senate voted 52\u201348 to confirm her nomination, with all Democrats and one Republican in opposition.[10]\n\n\nDescribed as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Justice Antonin Scalia,[11][12][13] Barrett supports textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation.[14][15][16] She is generally considered to be among the Court's conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Vivian Coney was born in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Linda (*n\u00e9e* Vath) and Michael Coney.[17][18] The eldest of seven children, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company, and her mother was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett has Irish and French ancestry.[19][20] Her maternal ancestors were from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland, while there is also Irish lineage among her father's ancestors. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans.[21] Her family is devoutly Catholic, and her father is an ordained deacon at St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Metairie, Louisiana, where she grew up.[22][23]\n\n\nBarrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans.[24] She was student body vice president of the school and graduated in 1990.[25] After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She considers herself \"somewhat fluent\" in French, but with a Louisiana accent.[26] Barrett graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa.[27] In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate.[28]\n\n\nBarrett then attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the *Notre Dame Law Review* and graduated in 1997 ranked first in her class with a Juris Doctor, *summa cum laude*.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships and private practice[edit]\n\n\nBarrett spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001.[29][31] While at Baker Botts, she worked on *Bush v. Gore*, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for the firm's representation of George W. Bush.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Barrett was a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School. In 2002, she joined the faculty of her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School.[34] At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, evidence, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.[35] Barrett was named a professor of law at Notre Dame in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held Notre Dame's Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law.[36] Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and *stare decisis*.[28] Her academic work has been published in the *Columbia*, *Cornell*, *Virginia*, *Notre Dame*, and *Texas* law reviews.[34]\n\n\nAt Notre Dame, Barrett received the \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" award three times.[34] From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established to inspire a \"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\".[37] While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory.[38][39]\n\n\nIn 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.[34]\n\n\n\n## Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (2017\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nFile:Prof Amy Coney Barrett 2 10.jpgBarrett before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 6, 2017\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\u2014the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin\u2014after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty.[42] Asked to \"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\"[43][44] and \"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"[45] Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\"[46] Worried that Barrett would not uphold *Roe v. Wade* given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\"[47][48][49]\n\n\nThe hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives.[29] Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins of the University of Notre Dame and Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \"religious test\" for office;[45][50] others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her investiture for the Seventh Circuit in 2018\nLambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization, co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate\u2014indeed, it obfuscates\u2014how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination.[54][55]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11\u20139 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate.[56][57] On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54\u201342.[58] It confirmed her by a vote of 55\u201343 on October 31, with three Democrats\u2014Joe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin\u2014voting for her.[27] She received her commission two days later.[2] Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit.[59]\n\n\n\n### Selected cases[edit]\n\n\nOral arguments from *Cook County, Illinois v. Chad F. Wolf*, one of the last cases that Barrett took in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020\nOn the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.[60][61] Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.[62][63]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing *en banc*. Three judges\u2014Chief Judge Diane Wood and judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton\u2014voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \"separate-but-equal arrangement\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5\u20133 decision.[64][29]\n\n\nIn 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of *Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation*. Smith was a Black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \"stupid-ass nigger\" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \"poor performance\".[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge rule\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card.[67] In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under *Chevron* Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act.[68] The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split.[68][69]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.[70] In a 2\u20131 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing *en banc* (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion-related cases[edit]\n\n\nBarrett had never ruled directly on abortion before joining the Supreme Court, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.[72][73]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \"bubble ordinance\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent.[74][75] Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in *Hill v. Colorado*, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.[77] The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by plaintiff Rickey Kanter, who had been convicted of felony mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment.[78] President Trump pardoned Kanter in December 2020.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal procedure[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking.[80] Following rehearing *en banc*, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \"playing with guns\", because no crime had been alleged.[82] Barrett distinguished *Navarette v. California* and wrote, \"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\"[83]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.[84][85]\n\n\n\n#### Qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff.[86] (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \"clearly established law\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity.[87]\n\n\nIn *Howard v. Koeller* (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \"snitch\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers*, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) from the nearest navigable river was among the \"waters of the United States.\"[90] The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable\u2010in\u2010fact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in *Rapanos v. United States*. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\"[93][94][95]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus measures[edit]\n\n\nIn early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.[30][96] On August 12, 2021, she rejected a challenge to Indiana University's vaccine mandate, marking the first legal test of COVID-19 vaccine mandates before the Supreme Court.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Civil procedure and standing[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III.[98] Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split.[99][100][101]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the *Shakman* case because it was not formally a party to the case.[102] The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020\nBarrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation.[104] In July 2018, after Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.[36][105][106]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh's selection in 2018, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.[107] After the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020, Barrett was widely mentioned as the front-runner to succeed her.[108] On September 26, 2020, Trump announced his intention to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death.[7][109]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who sought to confirm her before the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] She was a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.[72][111][112] Democrats generally opposed the nomination, and were opposed to filling the court vacancy while election voting was already underway in many states.[110] Many observers were angered by the move to fill the vacancy only four months before the end of Trump's term, as the Senate Republican majority had refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, more than ten months before the end of his presidency.[110][113][114]\n\n\nIn October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \"well qualified\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.[115] The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\".[116] Barrett's nomination came during a White House COVID-19 outbreak. On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing,[117] which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.[118][119] On October 22, the Judiciary Committee reported her confirmation favorably by a 12\u20130 vote, with all 10 Democrats boycotting the committee meeting.[120][121] On October 25, the Senate voted mostly along party lines to end debate on the confirmation.[122] On October 26, the Senate confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52\u201348, 30 days after her nomination and 8 days before the 2020 presidential election. Every Republican senator except Susan Collins voted to confirm her, whereas every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus[123] voted in opposition.[124] Barrett is the first justice since 1870 to be confirmed without a single vote from the Senate minority party.[125][126]\n\n\nThe nature of her appointment was criticized by numerous Democratic politicians; Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called it \"the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate.\"[127] Republicans responded that they were merely exercising their constitutional rights, and that accusations of hypocrisy were nothing more than \"an unwarranted tantrum from the left\".[127]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2020\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to Barrett on October 26, 2020, at the White House alongside President Donald Trump\n![](image)Chief Justice John Roberts administers the judicial oath to Barrett on October 27, 2020. Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse M. Barrett, holds the Bible.\nBarrett became the 103rd associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 27, 2020. On the evening of the confirmation vote, Trump hosted a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. As Barrett requested, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to her,[126][128][129] the first of two necessary oaths. She took the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the next day.[130]\n\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Barrett was assigned to the Seventh Circuit.[136] This assignment's duties include responding to emergency applications to the Court that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by herself or else by referring them to the full Court for review.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### Early oral argument participation[edit]\n\n\nHaving hired her allotted four law clerks, Barrett took part in her first oral argument on November 2, hearing the case *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club.*[138][139]\n\n\nOn November 4, the Court heard *Fulton v. Philadelphia*, in which the plaintiff, Catholic Social Services, sued the city of Philadelphia after being denied a new contract under the city's Fair Practices Ordinance, which bars discrimination in public accommodations. The Archdiocese-affiliated CSS said that for religious reasons it cannot properly vet potential foster parents who are gay couples. CSS argued that under relevant precedent, the Court should find that CSS as a faith-based charity was unfairly singled out, given that the city allows race- and disability-based exceptions within foster-care placements.[140][141] CSS further claimed the law is shown not to be neutral as required by the Court's 1990 decision *Employment Division v. Smith*, which allows the government to enforce neutral and generally applicable laws without having to make exceptions for individual religions, because the city labeled CSS's motives \"discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\"[141][142] According to the *New York Times,* Barrett's questions during oral arguments were \"evenhanded and did not reveal her position.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### First votes as a justice[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Barrett joined the Supreme Court's majority in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*,[144] 592 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020), in an unsigned[145] 5\u20134 preliminary injunction in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish organization Agudath Israel of America, saying that certain COVID-19 restrictions instituted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had likely violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in that they \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.\"[146][147][148][149] The Court said that the restrictions had likely impinged on the fundamental right of the free exercise of religion without their (in constitutional legal parlance) passing the legal test of \"strict scrutiny.\"[150] Cuomo's order was more restrictive than governmental orders involved in similar cases involving churches in California and Nevada that the Court had allowed to stand by a 5\u20134 vote.[151][152][153] Ross Guberman, author of *Point Taken: How to Write Like the World's Best Judges*, told the *Times* he believed Barrett was the principal author of the Court's decision because of its measured tone and word choices, including its use of the word \"show\".[154]\n\n\nBarrett delivered her first concurring opinion on February 5, 2021, in the case *South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom*.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Barrett joined the majority, in a 5\u20134 vote, to reject a petition to temporarily block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined her in the majority.[157]\nIn June 2022, Barrett joined with the same majority in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[158]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Supreme Court voted to allow the execution of an inmate to proceed in Alabama; the case was decided by a 5\u20134 vote, with Barrett joining Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in dissent.[159]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote her first majority opinion in *United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club*, which was decided on March 4, 2021.[155][160][161] Traditionally the first opinion delivered by a new justice reflects the opinion of a unanimous court, but not always. While Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wrote unanimous first opinions, Barrett, like her predecessor Justice Ginsburg, wrote an opinion for a divided court.[155][162][163]\n\n\nAlthough Barrett ruled against environmentalists in March, she voted against oil refineries in her first dissent, *Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v. Renewable Fuels Association*.[164]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights and issues[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Barrett joined a unanimous decision in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic social service agency that had been denied funding from the City of Philadelphia because it does not adopt to same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[165] In the same month, Barrett was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower court judgments in place.[166][167][168] In November 2021, Barrett voted with the majority in a 6\u20133 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[169] The Court's decision not to hear the case left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Vaccine requirements[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote a concurring opinion in *Does v. Mills,* a case challenging Maine's vaccine requirement for health care workers. She was in the majority in the 6\u20133 decision to deny a stay of the vaccine requirement, explaining that the case had not been fully briefed or argued.*[172]*\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy, academic writings, speeches, and political views[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Jay Schweikert, who advocates for the Court's or Congress's elimination of qualified immunity,[176] believes that her \"decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.\"[175][177] Legal commentator Jacob Sullum argues that while Barrett was on the Seventh Circuit she took \"a constrained view of the doctrine's scope.\"[178]\n\n\n\n### Textualism and originalism[edit]\n\n\nBarrett is considered a textualist, a proponent of the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering their legislative history or underlying purpose,[179][180][181][182] and an originalist (of the original-public-meaning, rather than original-intent, variety), a proponent of the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment.[179][183][184][185] According to her, \"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\"[183] For the purpose of \"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\" she refers[183] to a section of a law review article by Keith Whittington, \"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\",[186] that reads, \"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\"[186]\n\n\nTextualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \"ordinary meaning\": \"The law is comprised of words\u2014and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\" According to Barrett, \"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\".[187]\n\n\nBarrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism,[188] writing: \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\"[189] In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\"[183] In a 2017 article in the law review *Constitutional Commentary*, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\"[190][191]\n\n\nAccording to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\" Scalia insisted that \"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\"[192][193]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism.[192][193] She said that one example of the \"process-based\" approach can be found in *King v. Burwell*, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" to mean \"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\"[193]\n\n\n\n#### Suspension of habeas corpus[edit]\n\n\nIn a journal article, \"Suspension and Delegation\",[194] Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which *habeas corpus* may be legitimately suspended.[195] In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred\u2014and in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\"[81][194] In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in *Boumediene v. Bush* after considering historical factors.[196]\n\n\n\n### Precedent[edit]\n\n\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\";[197][198] she also said judges \"must apply the law as written\".[199][200] She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.[201]\n\n\nIn a 2013 article in the *Texas Law Review* on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \"superprecedents\"\u2014cases the Court would never consider overturning. They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as evidence that *Roe* had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as *Roe v. Wade* has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"[202][203]\n\n\nConcerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\"[202] She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"[202]\n\n\n\n### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.[204]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius* (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did\u2014as a penalty\u2014he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"[191][205][204][206]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBarrett opposes abortion.[207][208] In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper. The ad read: \"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of *Roe v. Wade* and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\"[209][210][211] In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against *Roe v. Wade* that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \"killed 55 million unborn children\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.[212]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020\n![](image)Then-Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse, in 2018\nIn 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal \u2013 LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC, in South Bend, Indiana,[213] and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.[214] Previously, Jesse Barrett had worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana for 13 years.[215] The couple live in South Bend and have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, one in 2005 and one after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[32][216] Their youngest biological child has Down syndrome.[217]\n\n\nBarrett is a practicing Catholic.[218] Since birth, she has been a member of the Christian parachurch community People of Praise,[219] an ecumenical covenant community founded in South Bend. Associated with the Catholic charismatic renewal movement but not formally affiliated with the Catholic Church,[220][221][222] about 90% of its approximately 1,700 members are Catholic.[220][222] In People of Praise, Barrett has served as a laypastoral women's leader in a position once termed \"handmaiden\" but now termed \"women leader\".[223][224]\n\n\nAccording to *Politico*, \"a copy of Barrett's ballot history from the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System obtained by POLITICO [shows] Barrett voted in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, and the 2016 Republican primary, though she pulled a Democratic ballot in the 2011 primary.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nBarrett was a member of the Federalist Society from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2017.[48][27][29] She is a member of the American Law Institute.[225]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Barrett's academic publications:[226]\n\n\n\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\nKavanaugh studied history at Yale University, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Yale Law School, after which he began his career as a law clerk working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become the head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including drafting the *Starr Report* recommending Clinton's impeachment. He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious and stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006.[2][4][5]\n\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11\u201310 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50\u201348.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[19] the son of Martha Gamble (*n\u00e9e* Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[20][21] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Roscommon, Ireland, in the late 19th century,[22][23] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[22] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[24] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[25][26]\n\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n## Legal career (1990\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (second from left) with President George W. Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\nAfter working as a summer associate for the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr, from 1992 to 1993.[42][43][44] He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994,[42] alongside Neil Gorsuch and with future federal judge Gary Feinerman.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ken Starr associate counsel[edit]\n\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\nAfter working in private practice in 1997\u201398, Kavanaugh rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In *Swidler & Berlin v. United States* (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the Court to disregard attorney\u2013client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6\u20133.[51]\n\n\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the *Starr Report*, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton\u2013Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail the authors called \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Kavanaugh rejoined Kirkland & Ellis in 1999 and eventually became a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was *pro bono* counsel of record for relatives of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, his relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate Gonz\u00e1lez to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the repatriation.[60]\n\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Circuit Judge (2006\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh is sworn into the D.C. Circuit by Justice Anthony Kennedy as his wife holds the bible and President Bush looks on, 2006. Coincidentally, Kavanaugh would be sworn into the U.S. Supreme Court 12 years later as Kennedy's replacement.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10\u20138 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[69] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57\u201336.[70][71] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[72] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[73]\n\n\nIn July 2007, senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[74][75] The issue reemerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[76]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nOn the 14 occasions on which Kavanaugh authored opinions that were considered by the Supreme Court, the Court adopted his position 13 times and reversed his position once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][77] He was regarded as a feeder judge.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the October 2017 decision *Garza v. Hargan*, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before traveling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously\".[79][80] Days later, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[80][81] In his dissent, he criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[82] The girl then obtained an abortion.[80] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the *en banc* D.C. Circuit's judgment and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot and does not serve as precedent.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[84][85] In his dissent, he compared the individual mandate to a tax. After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in *Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services* (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a long dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[86][87] In May 2015, he dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of *Priests for Life v. HHS*, in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Appointments Clause and separation of powers[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the president.[91][92] In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5\u20134.[93]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, he wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB director removable by the president of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7\u20133, over Kavanaugh's dissent.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of *mandamus* requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum, an orca.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6\u20132 in *EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P.* (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in *Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency* (2014).[106][107] After Kavanaugh dissented from a *per curiam* decision allowing the agency to disregard cost\u2013benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in *Michigan v. EPA* (2015).[108][109]\n\n\n\n#### Extraterritorial jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.* (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] He dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[77][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment and free speech[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] The Supreme Court summarily affirmed both those judgments on direct appeal.[116]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In *United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC* (2016), he dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule.\"[43][119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment and civil liberties[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The Supreme Court then affirmed the circuit's judgment in *United States v. Jones* (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment in *District of Columbia v. Wesby* (2018).[125]\n\n\nIn *Klayman v. Obama* (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an *en banc* rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata,[126][127] writing that the metadata collection was not a search, and even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh holds his daughter while greeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush.\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a long concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advance notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In *Kiyemba v. Obama* (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, he concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided the existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the *en banc* circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes.[139][140]\n\n\nIn *Meshal v. Higgenbotham* (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment and gun ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008).[143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Vaccine regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in *Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius*,[145] holding that opponents of thimerosal-preserved vaccines lacked standing to challenge determinations by the Food and Drug Administration that vaccines and their components are safe and effective. SCOTUSblog provided the case as an example of the fact that \"[e]ven when Kavanaugh rejects a claim, he sometimes uses his discussion of standing to show that he has heard the plaintiff's argument and taken it seriously\".[146] Bloomberg wrote, \"Kavanaugh's opinion for the court repeatedly went out of its way to show it respected the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs's (CoMeD) 'genuine concern' regarding thimerosal\", but nevertheless \"said the coalition was required to seek a ban through the executive or legislative branches\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Law clerk hiring practices[edit]\n\n\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's 48 law clerks have been women, and 13 people of color.[148] Some have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff).[149][150]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, *The Guardian* reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Rubenfeld said that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\" but did not say what that \"look\" was.[151] Unnamed sources reported that Chua said that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in job interviews with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[151] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[152] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction. Chua returned to regular teaching in 2019.[153]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh and his family with President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018\nOn July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.[155][156] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[157]\n\n\n\n### Legal philosophy and approach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Wade*, which ruled abortion bans unconstitutional, and *Furman v. Georgia*, which ruled all existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional.[160][161] Two law professors evaluated Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions for the *Washington Post,* rating his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Circuit in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[162]\n\n\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had often said the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history were *Brown v. Board of Education*, *Marbury v. Madison*, *Youngstown Steel*, and *United States v. Nixon*, with *Brown* the single greatest.[163]\n\n\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas was the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were delayed at the onset by objections from the Democratic members about the absence of records of Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received only the night before the first day of hearings.[166] Republicans asserted that the volume of documents available on Kavanaugh equaled that of the previous five nominees to the court; the Democrats responded that only 15% of the documents they had requested about Kavanaugh had been provided. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question-and-answer periods to begin the next day.[167]\n\n\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the Court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of preexisting healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, *Roe v. Wade*, or the president's power to self-pardon. He expounded at length on various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the president's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the previous session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections by Democrats.[168]\n\n\nThe committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails by Kavanaugh related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing to answer direct questions about matters he called hypothetical.[169] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to *The Intercept*, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from Kozinski, Kavanaugh replied, \"I do not remember\".[170] During his testimony, Kavanaugh said that Kozinski's 2017 exposure as an alleged prolific sexual harasser was a surprising \"gut punch\". *The Guardian* reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judicial system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[171]\n\n\n\nThe committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [*Roe v. Wade*] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the Court would do so.\"[172] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since 2003.[173] Senator Susan Collins indicated that Kavanaugh's statement did not contradict his personal assurance to her that *Roe* is settled law.[174] Kavanaugh noted that *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, *Casey* is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[175]\n\n\nOn September 27, the committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, his accuser.[176] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[177] Grassley cut her questioning short, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[178][179] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh.[180] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, both \"visibly drunk\", had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \"believed he was going to rape me\" and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[181][182][183] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack, has denied that it took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[184] In response to his testimony, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault allegations[edit]\n\n\n#### Christine Blasey Ford[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a *Washington Post* tipline and her U.S. Representative, Anna Eshoo, with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.[7][186] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to Senator Dianne Feinstein to inform her of her accusation against Kavanaugh,[187] requesting that it be kept confidential.[188] After a September 12 report in *The Intercept*,[7][186][189] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein said that the woman had claimed that, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had tried to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[190][191] The same day, Feinstein said she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[192][193]\n\n\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[194][195] She said that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[196] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[197] and believed he was going to rape her.[198] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[194][199]\n\n\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[193][192] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay his confirmation hearings.[200][201] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before his and Ford's scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[202]\n\n\nOn September 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 19.[203] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the committee whether she intended to testify. He added that Ford was welcome to appear before the committee privately or publicly.[204] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[205] A bipartisan Judiciary Committee panel and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[206]\n\n\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party or a sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[207] and Keyser told *The Washington Post* that she believed Ford's allegation.[208][209]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegation after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[210] Her attorneys tweeted, \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[211]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *New York Times* reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin published *The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation*. They reported that Keyser \"thought the whole setup Ford described ... sounded wrong\", and that she \"challenged Ford's accuracy\", quoting Keyser as saying, \"I don't have any confidence in the story\".[212] According to *The Washington Post*, the book revealed that \"Keyser also said she spoke with many people who 'wanted me to remember something different'\u2014suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line [against Kavanaugh]\".[213]\n\n\n\n#### Deborah Ramirez[edit]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of *The New Yorker* published an article with another sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983\u201384 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[214] *The New Yorker* spoke to four classmates, three identified as eyewitnesses but all denied witnessing the event.[214] *The New York Times* interviewed several dozen of Ramirez's classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[215] According to *The New York Times*, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[216] *The Washington Post* analyzed Ramirez's allegation and concluded, \"Ramirez's accusation has the dual distinction of having more potential corroboration and less actual corroboration than Ford's\".[217]\n\n\n\n#### Julie Swetnick[edit]\n\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti tweeted on September 23, 2018, that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" about Kavanaugh and Judge. Avenatti said his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[218][219][220] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee. In a sworn statement, Swetnick described attending \"well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981\u20131983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present\". She described witnessing efforts by Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Kavanaugh called her allegations \"ridiculous\" and Avenatti's allegation as a whole a \"farce\".[10] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends had come forward publicly to support her claims.[221] In an interview with NBC News, Swetnick clarified that she did not personally witness Kavanaugh or Judge spike any drinks, and accused Avenatti of twisting her words. She further clarified that she did not personally witness efforts by Kavanaugh or Judge to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Swetnick provided NBC News with the names of friends who attended the parties, but none could corroborate her claims, while some said they did not know her.[222][223] Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that they engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[224]\n\n\n\n#### Judy Munro-Leighton[edit]\n\n\nOn September 19, Judy Munro-Leighton accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an anonymous letter signed \"Jane Doe\", which was addressed to Grassley but mailed to Senator Kamala Harris. On September 26, the Senate committee interrogated Kavanaugh about this accusation. Kavanaugh called the accusation \"ridiculous\".[11] On November 1, Munro-Leighton talked to committee staff members. During the conversation she changed her story, denying that she had penned the anonymous letter and saying she had contacted Congress as \"a ploy\" to \"get attention\".[225] On November 2, Grassley announced Munro-Leighton's identity, and described her accusations as fabricated.[11] She was referred to the Department of Justice and FBI for making false accusations and obstructing justice.[11]\n\n\n\n#### FBI investigation and ethics complaints[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[226] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on delaying the vote in the full Senate for a week to allow the FBI to investigate Ford's claims. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[227] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within a week.[228] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where senators were permitted to review the report one at a time in secrecy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[229] Democrats called the FBI investigation incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[230][231] According to *The Washington Post*, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[211]\n\n\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh regarding his conduct during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate them. In December 2018, the panel dismissed all the complaints, calling them \"serious\" but deciding that lower court judges have no authority to investigate Supreme Court justices.[232]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 *Justice* film[edit]\n\n\nDoug Liman's 2023 documentary *Justice* recounts the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, including the testimony of Ford and Ramirez. It features a never-before-heard audio recording made by Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier, a Yale colleague of Kavanaugh's, that corroborates Ramirez's charges and suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman. Stier says that he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down with a group of rowdy soccer players forcing a drunk female freshman to hold Kavanaugh's penis. Stier also says that he had heard from classmates about Ramirez's similar encounter with Kavanaugh, which she personally describes in the film.[233]\n\n\nThe documentary also highlights the narratives Kavanaugh advanced to sway public opinion and gain Republicans' support, which reviewers described as misleading. Reviewers were persuaded that Kavanaugh and his team were aware of Ford's and Ramirez's charges before they became public and preemptively countered them by planting alternate narratives with friends and acquaintances.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Senate action[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51\u201349 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[236] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[237][238]\n\n\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50\u201348 vote.[239] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at his daughter's wedding that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition so that their votes would cancel out and the balance of the vote would be retained\u2014a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[240] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and all Democrats except Joe Manchin voted not to.[241] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. The only Supreme Court confirmation that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by a single vote, 24\u201323; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[242][243][244] In *percentage* terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews's. Matthews received 51.06% of the vote to Kavanaugh's 51.02%.[245]\n\n\n\n### Swearing-in[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[246] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[15][247][248] Upon joining the Court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[249][250]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2018\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh being sworn in to succeed Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice on October 8, 2018\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for *Stokeling v. United States* and *United States v. Stitt*.[251]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Kavanaugh was reassigned to both the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.[252] He had previously been assigned to the Seventh Circuit, which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.[253] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions)[254] that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by the assigned justice alone or else by the justice's referring them to the full Court for review.\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote his first Supreme Court opinion on January 8, 2019, in *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, a unanimous decision reversing an appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[255]\n\n\nOn February 27, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's liberal justices in *Garza v. Idaho*, a case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[256]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four more liberal justices to decline to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues in voting to reject a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[258] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[259] *CNBC* reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[260] The Supreme Court decided this case, *June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo*, on June 29, 2020, striking down Louisiana's requirement for abortion providers to hold hospital admitting privileges. Kavanaugh dissented.[261] In September 2021, by a 5\u20134 vote, the Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Kavanaugh was in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett.[262] In June 2022, in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, Kavanaugh joined the same four justices in voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[263]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nAlso in February, Kavanaugh was part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, he was part of the majority in a 5\u20134 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay his execution in order to have an imam present.[264] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four liberal justices in a 6\u20133 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[265][266] In January 2022, he voted with the majority in a 5\u20134 decision to allow an execution to proceed in Alabama.[267] In 2023 Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in *Reed v. Goertz*, ruling that Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed could seek DNA testing on evidence in his case despite the state's statute of limitations on such testing.[268]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, the Supreme Court ruled 6\u20133 that the workplace nondiscrimination protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted as protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in which he argued that sexual orientation discrimination has always been understood as distinct from sex discrimination. He conceded that sexual orientation discrimination \"may, as a very literal matter, entail making a distinction based on sex\"; nonetheless, he said, \"to fire one employee because she is a woman and another employee because he is gay implicates two distinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes two distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory prohibitions.\" He said that any change to the relevant law ought to be made by Congress, not by judges; and that \"both the rule of law and democratic accountability badly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation of the law, and not its ordinary meaning.\"[269] Kavanaugh's dissent did not discuss gender identity or use the word \"transgender\", although transgender rights were at issue in the case. In a footnote, he wrote that his analysis \"on the basis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\"[270] In October 2020, Kavanaugh agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[271]\n\n\nIn 2021, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption and social service agency that had been denied funding by the City of Philadelphia because it does not place children for adoption with same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices\".[272] The same month, Kavanaugh was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist, whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower courts' judgments in place.[273][274][275] In November 2021, Kavanaugh voted with the majority of justices in a 6\u20133 decision to decline to hear an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[276] Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; because four votes are required to hear an appeal, the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[277][278]\n\n\n\n### President Trump's taxes[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in *Trump v. Vance*, the Supreme Court ruled in two 7\u20132 decisions that the Manhattan District Attorney could access Trump's tax records, but that the issue of whether Congress could access the same records needed to be processed through the lower courts. Kavanaugh joined Roberts, Gorsuch, and the court's four Democratic appointees in the majority;[279] Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.[280] The rulings mean that the Manhattan DA will have access to the records while Congress does not, pending the outcome of the case in lower courts.[281]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nEight days before the 2020 presidential election Kavanaugh concurred that absentee votes properly cast in Wisconsin but received after November 3 must be discarded, joining the Court's conservatives in a ruling that requires deferral to state officials on elections.[282][283] On October 19, Kavanaugh voted to grant a request for a stay that would have prevented ballots sent before Election Day but delivered within three days after it from being counted. The Court was split 4\u20134, so the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania requiring all votes to be counted stood, but the case may be reheard.[284] Kavanaugh sided with Roberts and three liberal justices in a 5-3 majority to allow voting extension in North Carolina.[285]\n\n\n\n### Compensation of college athletes[edit]\n\n\nIn his concurrence in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston* in June 2021, in which the Court ruled unanimously that college sports were not exempt from antitrust law, Kavanaugh called the NCAA \"a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated.\" No one else, he said, could \"not ... pay workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.\" He said there were \"serious questions\" about other rules on compensation.[286]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh assassination plot\n\nIn the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide.[18][287] After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh stemmed from dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, as well as the potential for the Court to loosen gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Roske was armed with a pistol, two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and other items. He has been charged with attempted murder.[18]\n\n\n\n## Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on separation of powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School in 2009.[288] In 2008, Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, then the dean of Harvard Law School. According to *The Boston Globe*, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[291] After the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Harvard Law School graduates[*which?*] petitioned Harvard to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[292] In the summer of 2019, he joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[293]\n\n\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the *Minnesota Law Review* in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[294] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis\".[295] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly\", they may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[294] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[294] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[295]\n\n\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[296] To remedy this, he encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\", such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[296]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kavanaugh family with President Bush\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to former President George W. Bush,[297] married in 2004; the couple have two daughters.[298] They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\n\n\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[299] His bibs bore non-qualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[300] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5\u00a0km to 10 miles.[301][302]\n\n\nKavanaugh is a Roman Catholic[297] and serves as a regular lector at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament at Hanceville, Alabama. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[297][303]\n\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Kavanaugh, Brett (1989). \"Note: Defense Presence and Participation: A Procedural Minimum for Batson v.

Jackson was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office that same year.[1][2] She is the first black woman and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nJackson was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Miami, Florida. She received her undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, where she served as an editor of the *Harvard Law Review*, and clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she later assumed on the Supreme Court.[3] From 2010 to 2014, Jackson was the vice chairwoman of the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed her as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served until 2021. Since 2016, Jackson has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C.,[4] to parents who had been educated at historically black colleges and universities.[5][6][7] Her father, Johnny Brown, attended the University of Miami School of Law and became chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board. Her mother, Ellery, was school principal at the New World School of the Arts in Miami.[8][9] One of her uncles, Calvin Ross, served as the chief of the Miami Police Department.[8]\n\n\nJackson grew up in Miami and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School.[10] She distinguished herself as a champion debater,[11] winning the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans during her senior year.[12] She has recalled her experience with high school debate as one \"that I can say without hesitation was the one activity that best prepared me for future success in law and in life.\"[13] In 1988, Jackson graduated from Palmetto as senior class president.[11][14] In her high school yearbook, she was quoted as saying that she wanted \"to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment\".[15]\n\n\nAfter high school, Jackson matriculated at Harvard University to study government, having applied despite her guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower.[16] She took classes in drama and performed improv comedy, forming a diverse friend group.[17][18] As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dormitory window and protested the lack of full-time professors in the Afro-American Studies Department. While a freshman, Jackson enrolled in Michael Sandel's course *Justice*, which she has called a major influence during her undergraduate years.[18]\n\n\nIn 1989, when Jackson was a college student, an uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction after federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in duct tape. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case *pro bono*, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence.[19][20]\n\n\nJackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*.[21][11] Her senior thesis was titled \"The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants\".[22] From 1992 to 1993, Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for *Time* magazine,[23] attending Harvard Law School shortly afterward. She was a supervising editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997,[23] then to Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998.[26] She spent a year in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin (now part of Baker Botts), then clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer from 1999 to 2000.[10][27]\n\n\nJackson returned to private legal practice at the law firm of Goodwin Procter from 2000 to 2002, then under Kenneth Feinberg at the law firm now called Feinberg & Rozen LLP from 2002 to 2003.[28][29] From 2003 to 2005, she was an assistant special counsel to the United States Sentencing Commission.[30] From 2005 to 2007, Jackson was an assistant federal public defender in Washington, D.C., where she handled cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[31] A review by *The* *Washington Post* of cases Jackson handled during her time as a public defender showed that \"she won uncommon victories against the government that shortened or erased lengthy prison terms\".[32] From 2007 to 2010, Jackson was an appellate specialist in private practice at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.[29][27]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.[33][34] The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote on November 5, 2009. The Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on February 11, 2010.[35] She succeeded Michael E. Horowitz, who had served from 2003 until 2009. Jackson served on the Sentencing Commission until 2014.[36][27] During her time on the commission, it retroactively amended the sentencing guidelines to reduce the guideline range for crack cocaine offenses,[37] and enacted the \"drugs minus two\" amendment, which implemented a two offense-level reduction for drug crimes.[38]\n\n\n\n## District Court (2013\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pictured in 2019)\nOn September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States district judge for the District of Columbia to the seat vacated by retiring judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr.[39] Republican U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a relative by marriage, introduced Jackson at her December 2012 confirmation hearing and said, \"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.\"[8] On February 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote.[40] She was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on March 22, received her commission on March 26,[27] and was sworn in by Justice Breyer in May.[41] Her service as a district judge ended on June 17, 2021, when she was elevated to the court of appeals.[27]\n\n\nDuring her time on the district court, Jackson wrote multiple decisions adverse to the positions of the Trump administration. In her opinion ordering Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a legislative subpoena, she wrote that \"presidents are not kings\".[42] Jackson handled a number of challenges to executive agency actions that raised questions of administrative law. She also issued rulings in several cases that gained particular political attention.[43]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Law* reported in spring 2021 that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a \"potential blemish on her record\".[44] In 2019, Jackson ruled that provisions in three Trump executive orders conflicted with federal employee rights to collective bargaining. Her decision was reversed unanimously by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit also reversed another 2019 decision, involving a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security decision to expand the agency's definition of which non-citizens can be deported. Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron defended Jackson's record, saying she \"has written nearly 600 opinions and been reversed less than twelve times\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Selected rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson in 2020\nIn *American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture* (2013), Jackson rejected the meat packing industry's request for a preliminary injunction to block a United States Department of Agriculture rule requiring them to identify animals' country of origin. Jackson found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment.[45][46]\n\n\nIn *Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services* (2014), Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug Gralise. She concluded that the Orphan Drug Act required the FDA to grant Gralise exclusivity.[47]\n\n\nIn *Pierce v. District of Columbia* (2015), Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to provide the inmate with reasonable accommodations, or to assess his need for reasonable accommodations, during his detention in 2012. She held that \"the District's willful blindness regarding\" Pierce's need for accommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment of auxiliary aids\u2014and only after he specifically requested them\u2014fell far short of what the law requires.\"[48]\n\n\nIn April and June 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early.[49] She ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early without explanation was arbitrary and capricious.[50]\n\n\nIn *American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump* (2018), Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time federal employee labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. She ruled that the executive orders violated the right of federal employees to collectively bargain, as guaranteed by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.[51] The D.C. Circuit vacated this ruling on jurisdictional grounds in 2019.[52][53]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jackson dismissed 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation. She held that under the doctrine of *forum non conveniens*, the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this ruling in 2020.[54][55][56][57]\n\n\nIn 2019, in *Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan*, Jackson held that Congress had, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional challenges to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border.[58]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in *Make The Road New York v. McAleenan*, blocking a Trump administration rule that would have expanded expedited removal (\"fast-track\" deportations) without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants.[59] She found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule.[60] In a 2\u20131 ruling in 2020, the D.C. Circuit reversed the entry of the preliminary injunction, ruling that the IIRIRA (by committing the matter to the executive branch's \"sole and unreviewable discretion\") precluded APA review of the decision.[61]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a ruling in *Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn*, in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued former White House Counsel Don McGahn to compel him to comply with the subpoena to appear at an impeachment inquiry hearing on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\" even if the president orders them not to do so.[62] Jackson rejected the administration's assertion of executive testimonial immunity by holding that \"with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist\".[63] According to her, that conclusion was \"inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law.\"[63][64][65] Jackson's use of the phrase \"presidents are not kings\" gained popular attention in subsequent media reporting on the ruling.[66][67][68][69] Noting that she took four months to resolve the case, including writing a 120-page opinion, *The Washington Post* wrote: \"That slow pace contributed to helping Mr. Trump run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort before the 2020 election.\"[8] The ruling was appealed by the United States Department of Justice,[70] and the D.C. Circuit affirmed part of Jackson's decision in August 2020.[71] While the case remained pending, on June 4, 2021, McGahn testified behind closed doors under an agreement reached with the Biden administration.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson with Justice Stephen BreyerOn March 30, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Jackson as a United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.[73] On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. Biden nominated Jackson to the seat vacated by Judge Merrick Garland, who had stepped down to become U.S. Attorney General.[74] The American Bar Association appraised Jackson as \"well qualified with no recusals or abstentions\".[75]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[76] During her confirmation hearing, Jackson was questioned about several of her rulings against the Trump administration.[77] On May 20, Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee by a 13\u20139 vote.[78] On June 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on her nomination. On June 10, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52\u201346 vote.[79] On June 14, her nomination was confirmed by a 53\u201344 vote. Republican senators Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski joined all 50 Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.[80] She received her judicial commission on June 17, 2021.[81] Her service as a circuit judge ended on June 29, 2022, the day before she was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[27]\n\n\nIn her first written opinion for the court of appeals, Jackson, joined by the rest of the panel, invalidated a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.[82]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Jackson delivers remarks on her nomination in the Grand Foyer of the White House. (February 25, 2022)\n![](image)Justice Breyer administering the Judicial Oath to Jackson (June 30, 2022)\nIn early 2016, Obama administration officials vetted Jackson as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[83][84][85] Jackson was one of five candidates interviewed as a potential nominee.[86]\n\n\nIn early 2022, news outlets speculated that Biden would nominate Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Breyer.[87][88][89][90] Biden pledged during the 2020 United States presidential election campaign to appoint a Black woman to the court should a vacancy occur.[87] Jackson's appointment to the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most influential federal court, was viewed as preparation for a potential promotion to the Supreme Court.[91]\n\n\nJackson's potential nomination to the Supreme Court was supported by civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations.[19] Her potential nomination was opposed by Republican Party leaders and senators.[92][93][94] *The Washington Post* wrote that Jackson's experience as a public defender \"has endeared her to the more liberal base of the Democratic Party\".[95] While her supporters have touted her history as a public defender as an asset, during her 2021 confirmation hearing, Republicans tried to cast it as a liability.[32]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Biden announced that Jackson was his nominee to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court.[96] Her nomination was sent to the Senate on February 28.[97] Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on March 21.[98] After the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination by an 11\u201311 vote, the Senate discharged the committee from further consideration of her nomination by a 53\u201347 vote.[99][100][101][102] The next day, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of her nomination by a 53\u201347 vote,[103] and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then filed cloture on her nomination.[104] On April 7, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 53\u201347 vote.[105][106] Later that day, she was confirmed by the same margin.[107] Republicans Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in confirming Jackson to the Supreme Court.[108] She received her judicial commission as an associate justice on April 8.[27] She was sworn in and became an associate justice at noon on June 30, 2022, when Breyer's retirement went into effect.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\n\n## U. S. Supreme Court (2022\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court released its final merit opinions on the morning of June 30, 2022. At noon, Breyer officially retired and Jackson was sworn in, becoming the first Black woman[13][11] and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\nOn July 21, Jackson voted on her first Supreme Court case, joining the dissent in a 5\u20134 decision refusing to block a district court ruling that prevented the Biden administration from setting new enforcement priorities for immigrants entering the U.S. or living in the country illegally.[117] She participated in her first oral argument as an associate justice on October 3, in *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*.[118] On November 7 she wrote her first opinion, a two-page dissent from a denial of review in the case of a death row inmate in *Chinn v. Shoop*; the opinion was joined by Justice Sotomayor.[119]\n\n\nTwo contributors to *SCOTUSBlog* noted that, since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments, speaking an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000.[120] On February 28, 2023, Jackson authored her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in *Delaware v. Pennsylvania*, which involved how unclaimed money from MoneyGrams are distributed among individual states.[121]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, Jackson was assigned as the circuit justice for the First Circuit.[122]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters, concerning the power of employers to sue labor unions regarding the destruction of employer property following a strike. She wrote that the majority's decision failed \"Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes\" and ran the risk of potential \"erosion of the right to strike\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson at the James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner on February 24, 2020\nJackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy;[124] instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\".[125][126] Though she has not embraced the label, Jackson has expressed that she sees value in originalism, saying the \"Constitution is fixed in its meaning\", and has explicitly criticized living constitutionalism.[126]\n\n\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported that Jackson had \"not yet written a body of appeals court opinions expressing a legal philosophy\" because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2021. However, *The Times* said, Jackson's earlier rulings \"comported with those of a liberal-leaning judge\", including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions.[8] Additionally, a review of over 500 of her judicial opinions indicated that she would likely be as liberal as Breyer, the justice she replaced.[127]\n\n\nAccording to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" due to her relative youth, background as a public defender, and history of labor-friendly rulings.[128]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married surgeon Patrick Graves Jackson, whom she met at Harvard College.[130] He is a descendant of Continental Congress delegate Jonathan Jackson[131] and is related to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[132] The couple have two daughters.[133][134][135] Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[136] In a 2017 speech, she said, \"I am fairly certain that if you traced my family lineage back past my grandparents\u2014who were raised in Georgia, by the way\u2014you would find that my ancestors were slaves on both sides.\"[137] Jackson's paternal ancestry can be traced to Houston County, Georgia,[138] while her maternal ancestry can be traced to Calhoun County, Georgia.[139] Through her marriage, Jackson is related to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[140]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nJackson is a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services as well as Harvard University's Board of Overseers and the Council of the American Law Institute.[141] She also serves on the board of Georgetown Day School[142] and the U.S. Supreme Court Fellows Commission.[143]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, she served on the advisory board of Montrose Christian School, a Baptist school.[144] Jackson has served as a judge in several mock trials with the Shakespeare Theatre Company[145][146][147] and for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia's Mock Court Program.[148] In 2018, she presided over a mock trial hosted by Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law \"to determine if Vice President Aaron Burr was guilty of murdering\" Alexander Hamilton.[149]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jackson presented at the University of Georgia School of Law's 35th Edith House Lecture.[150] In 2018, she was a panelist at the National Constitution Center's town hall on Alexander Hamilton's legacy.[151] In 2020, Jackson gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day lecture at the University of Michigan Law School[152] and was honored at the University of Chicago Law School's third annual Judge James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner, hosted by the school's Black Law Students Association.[153] In 2022, she received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, presented by Awards Council members Justice Amy Coney Barrett and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154][155]\n\n\nJackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Recent Case (1995). \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) \u2013 Scope of Liability after Reves v.
