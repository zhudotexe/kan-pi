On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist.[25] By mid-April, disaster declarations were made by all states and territories as they all had increasing cases. A second wave of infections began in June, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000. By mid-October, a third surge of cases began; there were over 200,000 new daily cases during parts of December 2020 and January 2021.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Butcher, Lola (November 17, 2020). \"Pandemic puts all eyes on public health\". *Knowable Magazine*. doi:10.1146/knowable-111720-1.

In comparison with fully vaccinated people, the CDC found that those who were unvaccinated were from 5 to nearly 30 times more likely to become either infected or hospitalized. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare.[29][30] There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 31, 2023, President Biden announced the end to the COVID-19 emergency declarations by May 11, 2023.[189] By February 23, eighteen states had already cut payments for more than 10 million people, and Congress had decided to end the program early, exchanging additional benefits for a new permanent program that provides extra money to low-income families to replace school meals during the summer.[190]\n\n\n\n### April to June 2023[edit]\n\n\nOn April 10, 2023, President Biden signed into law a resolution terminating the national emergency, effective immediately.[191][192] This national emergency was separate from the public health emergency, which remained in effect until May 11, 2023.[191]\n\n\n\n### July to September 2023[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy July 4, 2021, 67% of the United States' adult population had received at least one dose, just short of a goal of 70%.

While vaccines have helped significantly reduce the number of new COVID-19 infections nationwide, states with below-average vaccination rates began to see increasing numbers of cases credited to the highly infectious Delta variant by July 2021, which led to an increased push by organizations and companies to begin imposing *de facto* mandates for their employees be vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA study of vaccine effectiveness found that U.S.-authorized bivalent mRNA boosters administered to those having already received 2 to 4 monovalent vaccinations provided significant additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2.[183] Concerns of a surge in Beijing caused the Biden administration to require U.S. visitors from China, Hong Kong, and Macau to provide proof of COVID-19 negative test results.[184] At the end of the year, the CDC reported that the COVID Omicron XBB.1.5 variant became much more prevalent and represented about 41% of new cases in the U.S. Scientists at Columbia University warned that the rise of subvariants could \"result in a surge of breakthrough infections as well as re-infections.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### January to March 2023[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n291. **^** ![Public Domain](image) This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: \"Interior Applauds Inclusion of Insular Areas through Operation Warp Speed to Receive COVID-19 Vaccines\" (Press release).

By mid-August 2021, nearly all states experienced double-digit growth in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Some, like Washington, had a 34% increase of patients over a single week in September. At various medical centers, ICUs had reached capacity, forcing doctors to postpone routine surgeries. In addition, countless hospitals were also short of beds and nurses, making care and response times a lot slower. It meant that patients might wait in the ER for many hours. While some hospitals with no more capacity had to find alternate medical facilities in other states, often hundreds of miles away.\n\n\n\nEmergency medical services in the United States also experienced a significant labor shortage, lengthening the time it took some patients to be transported to a hospital.\n\n## Vaccination campaign[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 vaccination in the United States\nSee also: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n277. **^** Fowlkes A, Gaglani M, Groover K, Thiese MS, Tyner H, Ellingson K (August 2021). \"Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Frontline Workers Before and During B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant Predominance - Eight U.S. Locations, December 2020-August 2021\" (PDF). *MMWR.

Some states like Texas and Arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Privacy concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in South Korea where authorities used cellphone tracking and credit card details to locate and test thousands of nightclub patrons when new cases began emerging.[205] Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631\u00a0million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6\u00a0billion will be needed.

By early September, at least seven states had called in their National Guard to help overworked hospitals, including Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021-10-19 |  | 41,207,528(+71,771) | 691,093(+1,970) |\n| 2021-10-20 |  | 41,278,899(+71,371) | 693,998(+2,905) |\n| 2021-10-21 |  | 41,345,856(+66,957) | 695,393(+1,395) |\n| 2021-10-22 |  | 41,437,034(+91,178) | 698,187(+2,794) |\n| 2021-10-23 |  | 41,463,619(+26,585) | 698,641(+454) |\n| 2021-10-24 |  | 41,478,785(+15,166) | 698,793(+152) |\n| 2021-10-25 |  | 41,566,634(+87,849) | 699,805(+1,012) |\n| 2021-10-26 |  | 41,646,679(+80,045) | 701,627(+1,822) |\n| 2021-10-27 |  | 41,728,118(+81,439) | 703,526(+1,899) |\n| 2021-10-28 |  | 41,794,595(+66,477) | 704,766(+1,240) |\n| 2021-10-29 |  | 41,883,187(+88,592) | 707,414(+2,648) |\n| 2021-10-30 |  | 41,909,810(+26,623) | 707,755(+341) |\n| 2021-10-31 |  | 41,926,087(+16,277) | 707,913(+158) |\n| 2021-11-01 |  | 42,037,629(+111,542) | 708,799(+886) |\n| 2021-11-02 |  | 42,101,654(+64,025) | 710,193(+1,394) |\n| 2021-11-03 |  | 42,171,751(+70,097) | 711,989(+1,796) |\n| 2021-11-04 |  | 42,241,514(+69,763) | 713,144(+1,155) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020-05-09 |  | 1,300,244(+27,421) | 72,950(+1,555) |\n| 2020-05-10 |  | 1,320,941(+20,697) | 73,895(+945) |\n| 2020-05-11 |  | 1,338,720(+17,779) | 74,735(+840) |\n| 2020-05-12 |  | 1,360,206(+21,486) | 76,326(+1,591) |\n| 2020-05-13 |  | 1,380,755(+20,549) | 78,041(+1,715) |\n| 2020-05-14 |  | 1,407,517(+26,762) | 79,899(+1,858) |\n| 2020-05-15 |  | 1,432,899(+25,382) | 81,423(+1,524) |\n| 2020-05-16 |  | 1,457,426(+24,527) | 82,654(+1,231) |\n| 2020-05-17 |  | 1,477,157(+19,731) | 83,439(+785) |\n| 2020-05-18 |  | 1,498,266(+21,109) | 84,231(+792) |\n| 2020-05-19 |  | 1,517,928(+19,662) | 85,656(+1,425) |\n| 2020-05-20 |  | 1,540,296(+22,368) | 87,184(+1,528) |\n| 2020-05-21 |  | 1,565,324(+25,028) | 88,470(+1,286) |\n| 2020-05-22 |  | 1,587,530(+22,206) | 89,732(+1,262) |\n| 2020-05-23 |  | 1,610,247(+22,717) | 90,821(+1,089) |\n| 2020-05-24 |  | 1,630,500(+20,253) | 91,467(+646) |\n| 2020-05-25 |  | 1,649,054(+18,554) | 91,971(+504) |\n| 2020-05-26 |  | 1,665,736(+16,682) | 92,605(+634) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe CDC reported that vaccine effectiveness fell from 91% against Alpha to 66% against Delta.[277] One expert stated that \"those who are infected following vaccination are still not getting sick and not dying like was happening before vaccination.\"[278] By late August 2021, the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of U.S. cases and was found to double the risk of severe illness and hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[279]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a study by the ECDC estimated that 470,000 lives over the age of 60 had been saved since the start of the vaccination roll-out in the European region.[280]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) booster vaccine\". *NHS*.

2021 saw another surge due to the new Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health care in U.S. hospitals was severely affected and led to crisis standards of care. Many hospitals were thereby unable to offer adequate medical care as a result of tight resources. For example, one hospital system in Oregon had to cancel or delay hundreds of surgeries as of mid-August. Hospitals also began seeing younger patients. And some experts found that the Delta variant was often more severe among younger age groups, whose vaccination rates were lower.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n287. **^** Payne, Amanda B.

Kolkata, Kochi,\u00a0Talwar, Tabar, Trikand, Jalashwa and Airavat have been deployed for shipment of liquid medical oxygen-filled cryogenic containers and associated medical equipment from various countries.\n\n\n**INS Kolkata** and **INS Talwar**, mission deployed in Persian Gulf, were the first batch of ships that were immediately diverted for the task and entered port of Manama, Bahrain on 30 April 2021.\n\n\n**INS Talwar**, with 40 MT Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) embarked, is headed back home.\n\n\n**INS Kolkata** has proceeded to Doha, Qatar for embarking medical supplies and will subsequently head to Kuwait for embarking Liquid Oxygen tanks.\n\n\nSimilarly, on the Eastern seaboard, **INS Airavat** too has been diverted for the task, while INS Jalashwa, the LPD which played a key role during op Samudra Setu last year was pulled out of maintenance, readied\u00a0and sailed out to augment the effort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### Air India Express Flight 1344[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Air India Express Flight 1344\n\nOne of the flights under the mission, Air India Express Flight 1344 from Dubai International Airport to Calicut International Airport, skidded off the runway and crashed into a gorge, killing 21 out of the 190 people on board.[389]\n\n\n\n#### Air India Flight AI-312 27-Aug Fiasco[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 August, Indians including women and children were not allowed to board the Air India flight AI-312 to Incheon (South Korea) at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (New Delhi) without prior information. More than 180 Indian passengers bought ticket to fly from India to Korea to join their families, universities and jobs.\n\n\nThese passengers reached Delhi airport from different cities of India. But hours before the boarding they were informed that they are not allowed to board the flight due to some approval issues with South Korea. All passengers were forced to return to their home cities.[390]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Indian media is focusing mostly on those returning to India, so outbound counts may go mostly unreported.\n5. **^** This is based on the Air India schedule; other sources, including the MEA, have given different timeframes.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite no scientific evidence behind the use of animal products to boost immunity against COVID-19, some individuals sought out traditional or religiously inspired methods. One such method involved scrubbing oneself in cow dung and urine, followed by rinsing off in cow milk or buttermilk on a weekly basis at cow shelters. Other methods involved consumption of cow dung and urine. Proponents of these pseudoscience preventative methods also occasionally consumed cow urine to boost immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and some Indian healthcare professionals likewise participated in these rituals. Cow dung and urine were promoted as effective treatment for COVID-19 by many religious leaders, medical professionals, other key opinion leaders, and government officials.[255]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe fees levied to passengers have presented a significant barrier to Indians who want to evacuate but did not have enough money to go home.[374] For example, in both the Middle East[375] and domestically in India,[376] migrant workers have not been paid for several weeks, making it difficult for them to afford evacuation flights, trains, and buses. Passengers also raised complaints about inadequate payment and reservation infrastructure for the Vande Bharat mission, with worries about security and the 30-minute time limit to pay.[377]\n\n\nThe mission notably excluded the state of West Bengal. In response, a state minister accused the MEA of discrimination, while Piyush Goyal claimed that the state government had not confirmed quarantine arrangements and that 3,700 people had registered to return there.[378] A couple days later, an evacuation flight from Dhaka, Bangladesh to the state capital Kolkata was confirmed.[379]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Phase 6 of Vande Bharat Mission has start on 1 September and India has operated a total of 1059 flights from Afghanistan, Bahrain, Cambodia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Maldives, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, UAE, UK and USA.\n\n\n\n#### Phase VII[edit]\n\n\nThe phase 7 of the Vande Bharat mission was operationalized in Oct 2020 and more than 1000 international flights have been scheduled from 19 countries under this phase during the course of October.

The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020,[4] when a man from S\u00e3o Paulo who had traveled to Italy[5] tested positive for the virus. The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by 21 March. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its one millionth case and nearly 49,000 reported deaths.[6][7] One estimate of under-reporting was 22.62% of total reported COVID-19 mortality in 2020.[8][9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **27 November:** Two raw sewage samples collected independently on 27 November 2019 in Santa Catarina, Brazil, will later detect SARS-CoV-2 (100,000 copies per litre), 66 days in advance of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the Americas. Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020. These samples can show that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in Brazil at least as early as late November 2019.[18] However, this is highly contested by the scientific consensus which shows that the virus emerged in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 March, experts from Italy warned that the coronavirus growth curve in Brazil would repeat that of European countries. An observatory with physicists from USP, University of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo State University, University of Bras\u00edlia, Federal University of ABC, UC Berkeley and the University of Oldenburg showed that the number of infected people, considering data from 19 March, had been doubling every 54 hours, and that the case total would exceed 3,000 by the 24th.[157][158]\n\n\nOn 21 March, researchers began to mobilize to increase the availability of testing in Brazil. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro was attempting to create a serology test, as opposed to the more common PCR test, to detect infections through a patient's blood samples.[159]\nMinister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that the number of cases would increase exponentially until the end of June.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 25 February, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Brazil (and the first in South America) was announced by the Health Department of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 a 61-year-old man who had returned from Lombardy, Italy.[28][29] A second case was confirmed soon after in another person who had recently returned from Italy.[30] On 28 February, scientists of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's Tropical Medicine Institute and the Adolfo Lutz Institute reported that they had sequenced the genomes of these two cases, which had been separately introduced from Northern Italy to Brazil on two occasions.[31][32] In an address on 6 March, President Jair Bolsonaro advised residents to \"strictly follow the experts' recommendations as the best protective measure\", but that \"there is no reason to panic\".[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe virus had reached remote locations; a Yanomami teen died of it in Roraima.[51]\n* **14 April:** The Ministry of Health reported a total of 25,262 confirmed cases and 1,532 confirmed deaths. Over 14,000 people were declared recovered, although they were not confirmed virus-free, only discharged from a hospital or asymptomatic.[52]\n* **16 April:** President Bolsonaro fired the Minister of Health, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, over disagreements about social distancing guidelines.[53] He said he would appoint a health minister who favored reopening businesses \"as quickly as possible\".[54] Shortly afterwards, Nelson Teich was appointed to replace him.[55]\n* **20 April:** Several cities started to ease social isolation guidelines in favor of contact tracing. Some retail stores were allowed to open as long as customers wore masks, the number of in-person customers was reduced, and customer personal information was tracked.[*citation needed*]\n* **24 April:** Brazil confirmed more than fifty thousand cases.[56]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a variety of responses from federal, state and local governments, having an impact on politics, education, the environment,[11] and the economy. On 27 March 2020 Brazil announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers[12] and most state governors have imposed quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus.[13] President Jair Bolsonaro has perpetuated conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19 treatments[14] and its origins,[15] and was accused of downplaying effective mitigations and pursuing a strategy of herd immunity.[16] In October 2021, a congressional panel recommended criminal charges against the president for his handling of the pandemic, including crimes against humanity.[16]\n\n\nAs of 13 June 2024, Brazil, with 37,519,960[1] confirmed cases and 702,116[1] deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only those of the United States and of India.\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **15 March:** *Brasil de Fato* reported the United States Department of Health and Human Services attempted to pressure the country not buy Sputnik V vaccine to diminish Russia's influence in the region.[119][120] This did not stop a consortium of Brazilian governors in some states from signing a 37 million dose purchase agreement.[121]\n* **17 March:** Brazilian Health Officials deem the Hospital crisis \"the worst in Brazil's history\".[122]\n* **19 March:** The ICUs of 16 Brazilian states were over 90% occupied, \"meaning those health systems have collapsed or are at imminent risk of doing so,\" according to CNN.[123]\n* **25 March:** Over 100,000 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in a single day, the highest rate of diagnosis since the pandemic began.[124]\n* **31 March:** There is now a total of 12,753,258 cases and 321,886 deaths.[125]\n\n\n#### April[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Deforestation of Amazon rainforest accelerates amid COVID-19 pandemic\".

Without water to clean themselves, this made them vulnerable to the proliferation of coronavirus. Water did not reach parts of the Baixada Fluminense and the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro. Among the affected areas are the Chatuba de Mesquita, Camarista, M\u00e9ier and Complexo do Alem\u00e3o communities. The infectious disease doctor and pediatrician Cristiana Meirelles said that without clean running water, the situation of fighting the epidemic would become catastrophic.[234]\nCufa (*Central \u00danica das Favelas*, a NGO that operates with Favelas) called for measures to contain coronavirus in favelas. Government actions did not include the economically fragile, a contingent that totals more than 70 million people, said the organization.[235]\n\n\nSome areas of Mar\u00e9 had been without water for two days, and other areas were reported to have been without water for two weeks.[236][237]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDom Odilo Scherer, Archbishop of S\u00e3o Paulo, had initially defended the position that churches should not be closed, arguing that there should be more daily services to diffuse large gatherings. Later, he declared the suspension of celebrations with the people.[252][253][254] Bishop Edir Macedo, founder of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, also declared that services should not be suspended, as well as Silas Malafaia, leader of Assembleia de Deus Vit\u00f3ria em Cristo.[252] Malafaia said he would only close his churches if mandated by a court order. Macedo caused greater controversy after he dismissed coronavirus as a creation of the media.[255]\n\n\n\n### Television programming[edit]\n\n\nBrazilian networks started airing prevention tips during their programming. Globo, SBT, RecordTV, Band, and RedeTV! announced they would stop production of all of their *telenovelas*, and would record their talk shows without a live audience, while expanding journalism in their programming.[256][257][258]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** \"26 estados e o DF vacinaram 2,22 milh\u00f5es contra Covid, aponta cons\u00f3rcio de ve\u00edculos de imprensa\" [26 states and Federal District vaccinated 2.22 million against Covid, points press consortium]. *G1* (in Brazilian Portuguese). 1 February 2021.

The patient had not travelled abroad which sparked fears that the coronavirus might have been spreading in Europe earlier than leaders had thought.\n\n\nOn 11 May 2020, as daily cases had dropped to under 100 per day, primary schools and some middle schools were allowed to reopen in what was the first steps to reopening the economy.\n\n\nOn 28 May 2020, \u00c9douard Philippe announced that a travel ban of 100\u00a0km (62 miles) would be lifted on 2 June 2020. Cafes, bars and restaurants were also allowed to reopen on the same day.

Early prevention measures included restricting the China\u2013Russia border and extensive testing. The infection spread from Italy on 2 March, leading to additional measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres, and museums, as well as shutting the border and declaring a non-working period which, after two extensions, lasted until 11 May 2020.

It also said that the difference was due to changes made by the Health Ministry in the approach of counting deaths, saying that \"new recommendations allowed us to improve the calculation of cases where COVID was the main cause of the death and of those where it became, with a high degree of probability, a catalyst...for other illnesses\".[181]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe also said that the figures represent a 2.6% death rate among those infected, and that the death rate for May will be higher.[160]\n\n\nPavel Malkov, the head of Rosstat, said in an interview with RBK published on 23 June that the statistics agency had published a higher death toll for April because it receives more complete data than the national coronavirus crisis centre and that it has a different calculation methodology, saying that the agency receives data from the Civil Registry Office and deals with death certificates that can take up to 45 days to complete following testing while the crisis centre publishes operational data manually entered into the system. He also said that \"one of the biggest secrets in statistics is that it's practically impossible to manipulate\" and that \"if we're talking about a qualitative indicator with a developed methodology, then any attempt to affect the final numbers by distorting the input data will become immediately evident\".[161][162]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** \"\u0412 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u0438\".

More than sixteen African countries, including Malawi and Senegal, recorded an uptick in new cases.[42] The World Health Organization labelled it Africa's 'Worst Pandemic Week Ever'.[43]\n\nThe government of Egypt denied January 2021 allegations that the shortage of oxygen had killed several COVID-19 patients at one of its hospitals. However, an investigation led by *The New York Times* confirmed that the authorities had lied. The video of one of Egypt's hospitals treating critical patients using manual ventilation methods went viral on Facebook. The video was posted by Ahmed Nafei, the nephew of a 62-year-old woman who died. In addition, the relatives of the dead patients and the El Husseineya Central Hospital's medical staff also confirmed in an interview given to *The New York Times* that the cause of death had been the shortage of oxygen.[44]\n\n\n\n### Antarctica[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica\n\n![](image)Confirmed cases in Antarctica\n\nDue to its remoteness and sparse population, Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected directly by the pandemic.[45][46][47] The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in China. At least 36 people are confirmed to have been infected.[48]\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Asia\n\n![](image)COVID-19 deaths per million residents in Asia as of 10 December 2020 |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u2265 800\n 600\u2013799\n 300\u2013599\n | 200\u2013299\n 100\u2013199\n <100\n |\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic began in Asia in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread widely through the continent. As of 13 June 2024,[49] at least one case of COVID-19 had been reported in every country in Asia except Turkmenistan.\n\n\nThe Asian countries with the highest numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases are India, South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, and Iran.[50] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Bhutan,[51] Singapore,[52] Taiwan,[53] and Vietnam[54] has allowed them to fare comparatively well. China was criticised for initially minimising the severity of the outbreak, but its wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.[55][56][57][58]\n\n\n\nAs of July 2021, the highest numbers of deaths are recorded in India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey, each with more than 90,000 deaths and more than 900,000 deaths combined. However, the death toll in Iran and Indonesia are claimed to be much higher than the official figures.[59][60] Per capita, the highest deaths have been disproportionally in several Western Asian states, with Georgia having the highest figure closely followed by Armenia, and Iran in third, whereas China had the lowest.[61]\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n\n![](image)COVID-19 deaths per million residents in Europe as of 5 February 2022\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Europe with its first confirmed case in Bordeaux, France, on 24 January 2020, and subsequently spread widely across the continent. By 17 March 2020, every country in Europe had confirmed a case,[62] and all have reported at least one death, with the exception of Vatican City.\n\n\n\nItaly was the first European country to experience a major outbreak in early 2020, becoming the first country worldwide to introduce a national lockdown.[63] By 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic[64][65] and it remained so until the WHO announced it was overtaken by South America on 22 May.[66] By 18 March 2020, lockdowns introduced in Europe affected more than 250\u00a0million people.[67] Despite deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late 2021.[68] On 11 January 2022, Dr. Hans Kluge, the WHO Regional Director for Europe said, \"more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks\".[69]\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in North America\n\n![](image)Map last updated: December 2020 <500 confirmed cases\n500\u20131,000\n1,000\u20132,000\n2,000\u20135,000\n5,000\u201310,000\n10,000\u201350,000\n50,000\u2013100,000\n100,000\u2013200,000\n>200,000 confirmed cases\n\nThe first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in North America were reported in the United States on 23 January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 March 2020, the United States became the country in North America with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, at over 82,000 cases.[71] On 11 April 2020, the United States became the country in North America with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, at over 20,000 deaths.[72] As of 10 April 2022, there are about 97 million cases and about 1.4 million deaths in North America; about 88.9 million have recovered from COVID-19, meaning that nearly 11 out of 12 cases have recovered or that the recovery rate is nearly 92%.[73]\n\n\nAs of 10 April 2022, the United States has had the highest number of cases in North America, at about 82 million cases, as well as the highest death toll, at over a million deaths. There have been nearly 75.7 million recoveries in the United States as of 10 April 2022, meaning that nearly 12 out of 13 cases in the country have recovered or that the recovery rate is about 92%. On 20 March 2022, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States exceeded a million.\n\n\n\nAs of 10 April 2022, Canada has reported nearly 3.6 million cases and about 38,000 deaths,[74] while Mexico, which was overtaken in terms of the number of cases on 11 March 2022, the second anniversary of the day when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic, by Japan, the second most affected country in East Asia, has reported about 5.7 million cases and about 320,000 deaths.[75] The state in the United States with the highest number of cases and the highest death toll is California, at about 9.1 million cases and nearly 90,000 deaths as of 10 April 2022.[76]\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Oceania\n\n![](image)Confirmed cases in Oceania as of 31 July 2021 1\u20139 confirmed cases\n 10\u201399 confirmed cases\n 100\u2013999 confirmed cases\n 1000\u20139999 confirmed cases\n 10,000+ confirmed cases\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne, Australia.[77] The virus has spread to all sovereign states and territories in the region.[78] Australia and New Zealand were praised for their handling of the pandemic in comparison to other Western nations, with New Zealand and each state in Australia wiping out all community transmission of the virus several times even after re-introduction in the community.[79][80][81]\n\n\n\nAs a result of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant however, by August 2021, the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts.[82] In early October 2021, New Zealand also abandoned its elimination strategy.[83][84]\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in South America\n\n![](image)Confirmed cases in South America as of 21 March 2021 1\u2013499 confirmed cases\n500\u2013999\n1,000\u20131,999\n2,000\u20134,999\n5,000\u20139,999\n10,000\u201349,999\n50,000\u201399,999\n100,000\u2013199,999\n200,000+ confirmed cases\n\nThe pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on 26 February 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in S\u00e3o Paulo.[85] By 3 April, all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case.[86]\n\n\nOn 13 May 2020, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of COVID-19 infection with, 23,091 deaths. On 22 May 2020, citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic.[87][88]\n\n\n\nAs of 12 January 2023, South America had recorded 67,331,547 confirmed cases and 1,344,031 deaths from COVID-19. Due to a shortage of testing and medical facilities, it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show.[89]\n\n## At sea[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships and COVID-19 pandemic on naval ships\n\n![](image)*Diamond Princess* undergoing a cleaning and disinfection process at Daikoku Pier in Yokohama Port photographed on 1 March 2020\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Parts of this article (those related to crew strandings, case numbers) need to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(March 2021)*\n |\n\n\nEarly in 2020, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease spread to a number of cruise ships, with the nature of such ships\u00a0\u2013 including crowded semi-enclosed areas, increased exposure to new environments, and limited medical resources\u00a0\u2013 contributing to the heightened risk and rapid spread of the disease.[90]\n\n\n\nThe British-registered *Diamond Princess* was the first cruise ship to have a major outbreak on board, with the ship quarantined at Yokohama from 4 February 2020 for about a month. Of 3711 passengers and crew, around 700 people became infected and 9 people died.[91][92]\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic spread to many military ships. The nature of these ships, which includes working with others in small enclosed areas and a lack of private quarters for the vast majority of crew, contributed to the rapid spread of the disease, even more so than on cruise ships.[93][94]\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of operations security, national militaries may have policies in place that prevent or restrict reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths, so although the cases listed below may have been widely reported in reliable sources, confirmation by official spokespeople of the respective militaries is not systematic.[95]\n\n##

Private citizens have reported hospitals being overwhelmed with patients showing COVID-19-like symptoms, including a very large outbreak in a women's prison that apparently began September 2020. The Turkmenistan government has instead reported a large increase in atypical pneumonia cases.\n\n\nThe last territory in the world to have its first COVID infection was Tokelau, a dependency of New Zealand that reported five cases 21 December 2022.[100]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* COVID-19 pandemic death rates by country\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** **Our World in Data** (OWID).

counts[edit]\n\n\nDoctors and media expressed scepticism of official infection counts in some countries,[9][10][11] and statistical analysis suggested anomalies.[12] Sceptics of the Russian official counts included medical doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva,[9] doctors Ivan Konovalov and Samuel Greene, and medical news editor Aleksey Torgashev.[10] The *Nexta* media agency stated that it had obtained leaked administrative documents showing higher infection counts than those publicly stated by Belarusian authorities.[11] Statistical analysis of official counts from around the world found signs of \"suspiciously low statistical noise\" in the officially confirmed counts of some countries, with the Algerian counts including a 28-day sequence with a strongly sub-Poissonian noise level, and 28-day sequences best modelled as having sub-Poissonian noise for the daily confirmed counts in Tajikistan, Turkey, Russia, Belarus, Albania, the United Arab Emirates and Nicaragua.[12]\n\n\nLower statistical noise in the official infection counts is statistically associated with less press freedom, as measured by the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.[12] Benford's law analysis of the rising phase of the pandemic per country found that the official counts are more statistically credible for countries that are more democratic, have higher GDP per capita, or have more health funding or better universal health insurance systems.[13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to ***COVID-19***.\n\nPortals:* ![virus icon](image)

It also has cumulative death totals by country. For these numbers over time see the tables, graphs, and maps at COVID-19 pandemic deaths and COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory.\n\n\nThis data is for entire populations, and does not reflect the differences in rates relative to different age groups. For example, in the United States as of 27 April 2021, the reported case fatality ratios were 0.015%, 0.15%, 2.3%, and 17% for the age groups 0\u201317, 18\u201349, 50\u201374, and 75 or over, respectively.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Data reliability[edit]\n\n\nVariation between testing programmes worldwide results in different ascertainment rates per country: not every SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor every COVID-19-related death, will be identified, while on the other hand some deaths may be wrongly attributed to COVID (for example if all suspected COVID deaths are counted as Covid deaths, as Belgium was doing in September 2020, or when for several months after April 2020, England reported all deaths after a positive COVID-19 test \"in order to be sure not to underestimate the number of COVID-19 related deaths\", while Scotland reported all deaths within 28 days of such a positive test).[2][3] Therefore, the true numbers of infections and deaths[*clarification needed*] will exceed the observed (confirmed) numbers everywhere, though the extent will vary by country.[4] These statistics are therefore less suitable for between-country comparisons. As deaths are easier to identify than infections (which are regularly asymptomatic), the true case fatality rate (CFR) is likely lower than the observed CFR.\n\n\nCauses of variation in true CFRs between countries, include variations in age and overall health of the population, medical care, and classification of deaths.[5]\n\n\nExcess mortality statistics provide a more reliable estimate of all COVID-19-related mortality during the pandemic, though they include both \"direct COVID-19 and indirect, non-COVID-19 deaths\".[6]\nThey compare overall mortality with that of previous years, and as such also include the potentially vast number of deaths among people with unconfirmed COVID-19. Data from Russia illustrates how the true death rates from COVID-19 can be far higher than visible from confirmed COVID-19 deaths: in December 2020, based on overall excess mortality during the year, total COVID-19 deaths in Russia were estimated to be over 186,000,[7]\nwhile confirmed COVID-19 deaths were at 56,271.[8]\nFor the Netherlands, based on overall excess mortality, an estimated 20,000 people died from COVID-19 in 2020,[9] while only the death of 11,525 identified COVID-19 cases was registered.[8] The official count of COVID-19 deaths as of December 2021 is slightly more than 5.4 million, according to World Health Organization's report in May 2022. WHO also said that the real numbers are far higher than the official tally because of unregistered deaths in countries without adequate reporting.[10]\n\n\n\n## Table of total cases, deaths, and death

Russia's case definition for a COVID-19 death, for example, relies solely on results from autopsy, unlike most European countries.6 Death must have been due directly to COVID-19, so it is not counted if a patient was found to have COVID-19 but it did not cause their death.6,7 This will lead to significant underreporting, especially as Russia has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases worldwide and yet has a case fatality rate of only 1.7% as of 31 July 2020.3 Spain's definition requires a positive polymerase chain reaction or antibody test for COVID-19, with only hospital deaths included in the death count despite a significant number of deaths from COVID-19 in the community and care homes.8,9 Belgium, by contrast, has one of the broadest definitions for a COVID-19 death, including all suspected cases. Care home deaths in Belgium account for around half of all excess deaths, but only 26% of care home deaths were confirmed (rather than suspected) COVID-19,10 leading to possible overcounting relative to other countries.11\n4. **^** Verity, Robert (March 30, 2020). \"Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis\". *The Lancet.
