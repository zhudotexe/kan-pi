(Red indicates Hispanic of any race; Blue indicates non-Hispanic White; and Green indicates non-Hispanic Black or African-American.)\n\n\n| Racial composition | 2013[3] | 1990[4] | 1970[4] | 1940[4] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 40.8% | 35.7% | 73.4% | 98.3%\n |\n| —Non-Hispanic | 10.5% | 22.6% | n/a | n/a\n |\n| Black or African American | 43.3% | 37.3% | 24.3% | 1.7%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 54.6% | 43.5% | 27.7%[5] | n/a\n |\n| Asian | 4.2% | 3.0% | 0.5% | 0.1%\n |\n| Other race | — | 23.5% | 1.6% | (X)\n |\n\n\nAccording to a 2013 Census Bureau estimate,[6] 45.8% of the Bronx's population was white, mostly Hispanic, 43.3% was black or African American, 4.2% Asian, 3.0% American Indian, 0.4% Pacific Islander, and 3.3% of two or more races. In addition, 54.6% of the population was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race.\n\n\nThe Census Bureau considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country. There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different race or ethnicity.[2] The borough's formerly most populous racial group, white, declined from 98.3% in 1940 to 45.8% by 2012.[3]\n\n\n31.7% of the population were foreign born and another 8.9% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parents. 55.6% spoke a language other than English at home and 16.4% had a bachelor's degree or higher.[7]\n\n\nApproximately 44.3% of the population over the age of 5 speak only English at home, which is roughly 570,000 people. The majority (55.7%) of the population speak non-English languages at home. Over 580,600 people (45.2% of the population) speak Spanish at home.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2020 Census[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there was a total population of 1,472,654 residents with 806,463 Hispanic residents making up 54.8%, 419,393 Black residents making up 28.5%, 130,796 White residents making up 8.9%, and 67,766 Asian residents making up 4.6%. Hispanic and Black populations overwhelmingly made up the vast majority of the Borough, but the Hispanic population was two times the size of the Black population. With the Hispanic making up a more than 50% majority in the borough, it is the largest concentration of Hispanic communities of NYC. Meanwhile, the other 3 boroughs like Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens had a more or less equal diverse racial and ethnic populations than The Bronx. Of all of the NYC boroughs, The Bronx has the highest overwhelming concentration of Non-White populations and it is the only borough in all of NYC to be almost exclusively populated by Non-White enclaves.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2010 Census[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 10.9% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 30.1% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 3.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.6% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.2% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 53.5% of Bronx's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).[12]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2000 Census[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poverty concentrations in the Bronx.\nAt the 2000 census there were 1,332,650 people, 463,212 households, and 314,984 families residing in the borough of The Bronx in New York City. The population density was 12,242.2/km2 (31,709.3/mi2). There were 490,659 housing units at an average density of 4,507.4/km2 (11,674.8/mi2). The racial makeup of the borough was 35.64% Black or African American, 29.87% White, 0.85% Native American, 3.01% Asian, 0.10% Pacific Islander, 24.74% from other races, and 5.78% from two or more races. 48.38% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 14.5%.[13] were whites, not of Hispanic origins. The Bronx has the largest number of Puerto Ricans of any county in the United States. It also has one of the highest percentages of Dominicans in the U.S. with 14.5%.\n\n\nBased on sample data from the same census, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 47.29% of the population 5 and older speak only English at home. 43.67% speak Spanish at home, either exclusively or along with English. Other languages or groups of languages spoken at home by more than 0.25% of the population of the Bronx include Italian (1.36%), Kru, Ibo, or Yoruba (3.07%), French/French Creole (2.72%), and Albanian (2.54%).\nOf the 463,212 households, 38.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.4% were married couples living together, 30.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.0% were non-families. 27.4% of households were one person, and 9.4% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.78 and the average family size was 3.37.\n\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 29.8% under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 30.7% from 25 to 44, 18.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% 65 or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 87.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and older, there were 80.7 males.\n\n\nThe median household income was $27,611 and the median family income was $30,682. Males had a median income of $31,178 versus $29,429 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $13,959. About 28.0% of families and 30.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 21.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n\n## White population[edit]\n\n\nOut of all five boroughs, The Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of non Hispanic white residents. At the 2009 American Community Survey, Whites, of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin, represented 24.4% of the population, while non-Hispanic Whites made 12.1% of the population.[14] The 2010 Census puts the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites at 10.9% of the population.\n\n\nThe number of non-Hispanic Whites in the Bronx has been shrinking for decades. People of Irish descent number over 35,500 individuals and make up 2.6% of the population. German Americans and Polish Americans make up 1.4% and 0.8% of the population respectively.\n\n\nSome main European ancestries of Bronx residents, 2000 (percentage of total borough population): \n\n\n\n* Italian : 5.2%\n* Irish : 3.2%\n* Albanian : 2.54%\n* German : 1.3%\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the White population declined from 151,209 residents at 10.9% to 130,796 residents at 8.9%, a loss of -20,413 or -13.5%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Black and African American population[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2009 American Community Survey, Black people represented 37.5% of the population, with 30.8% being non-Hispanic Black people.[16]\nOver 526,200 black people reside in the borough, of which 419,600 are non-Hispanic black people. Over 61,000 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, making up 4.4% of the population. Those whose ancestors have been in the United States since before the end of slavery are one group. Another is those of Caribbean ancestry. Colin Powell, a son of Jamaican immigrants, grew up in the Bronx. Some people have ancestries from both these groups, and like most African-American communities many people in both these groups have European and Native American ancestry as well. A third group, that is actually more internally diverse than these other two is African immigrants. They hail primarily from West Africa. There is also a small East African/Ethiopian population, mostly in and around Parkchester. The largest numbers come from Nigeria, but other nations such as Liberia, Ghana, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, to name just a few, have contributed to this population.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Black population went from 416,695 residents at 30.1% to 419,393 residents at 28.5%, a gain of 2,698 residents or 0.6%. Though their percentage portion dropped slightly due to other racial populations increasing.[15]\n\n\n\n## Native American population[edit]\n\n\nNative Americans are a very small minority in the borough. Only some 5,560 individuals (out of the borough's 1.4 million people) are Native American, which is equal to just 0.4% of the population. In addition, roughly 2,500 people are Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin.\n\n\nHowever a significant amount of the Hispanic population are native but due to the confusion of the census it's not reflected.\n\n\n\n## Asian population[edit]\n\n\nAsians are a small but sizable minority in the borough. At the 2009 American Community Survey 3.8% of Bronx's population was Asian.[17]\n\n\n\n* Indian 1.0%\n* Chinese 0.7%\n* Filipino 0.5%\n* Vietnamese 0.2%\n* Japanese 0.1%\n* Korean 0.1%\n\n\nAlthough having fewer Asians than other borough of New York, there are some Asian groups more numerous in the Bronx than elsewhere in the city. In 2000 the Bronx had the most Cambodians, the only New York borough with over 1000 Cambodians, they numbered 1366 in the Bronx. Asian Indians were the Bronx's most numerous Asian group, numbering 19305. There were 7628 Chinese in the borough, and 5446 Filipinos. Koreans numbered 4076. The total for Vietnamese was 3289 while Bangladeshis were counted at 2442. The only other Asian group numbering over 1000 in the city was the 1727 Pakistanis.[18]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Asian population went from 47,335 residents at 3.4% to 67,766 residents at 4.6%, a gain of 20,431 residents or 43.2%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Multiracial population[edit]\n\n\nPeople identifying multiracial heritage are also a sizable minority in The Bronx, numbering over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and African American heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1% of the population. People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1% of the population. From 2010 to 2020, the multiracial population went from 15,962 residents at 1.2% to 28,370 residents at 1.9%, a gain of 12,408 residents or 77.7%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Hispanics and Latino population[edit]\n\n\nThe Bronx is the only New York borough with a Hispanic majority. At the 2010 Census, 53.5% of Bronx's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). At the 2009 American Community Survey, Puerto Ricans represented 23.2% of the borough's population, Mexicans made 5.2%.[17] In 2005, more than 200,000 Dominicans called the Bronx home, other Hispanics such as Salvadorans and Ecuadorians also call the Bronx home,[19] and in 2000 Dominicans comprised 14.5% of the Bronx population.[20] The Puerto Rican population was at its height around 1980 when they represented about 30% of the Bronx, it declined in the 1990s and early 2000s, and it is relatively stagnant now. The Dominican population has been growing heavily since the 1990s. As of 2017, Dominicans made up 22.4% of the Bronx population, while Puerto Ricans made up 19.6%, giving the Bronx some of the highest concentrations of both in the country. Together these 2 groups make up over 75% of the borough's Hispanics.[21]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Hispanic population went from 741,413 residents at 53.5% to 806,463 residents at 54.8%, a gain of 65,050 residents or 8.8%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 46.29% (584,463) of Bronx residents age 5 and older spoke Spanish at home as a primary language, while 44.02% (555,767) spoke English, 2.48% (31,361) African languages, 0.91% (11,455) French, 0.90% (11,355) Italian, 0.87% (10,946) various Indic languages, 0.70% (8,836) other Indo-European languages, and Chinese was spoken as a main language by 0.50% (6,610) of the population over the age of five. In total, 55.98% (706,783) of the Bronx's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[22]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2009 American Community Survey, 31.9% of Bronx's population was foreign born and another 8.5% was born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s).[23] During the 1960s, the Bronx transitioned from majority Irish, Italian and Jewish to majority Puerto Rican and African American. However, since around 2000, increases in cost of living in New York and heavy immigration from Latin America and Africa, a new transition has been taking place, with Dominicans now outnumbering Puerto Ricans and African immigrants growing in size to the African American population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Bronx residents born abroad or overseas, 1930 and 2000** |\n| **1930 United States Census**[24] | **2000 United States Census**[25] |\n| **Total population of the Bronx** | **1,265,258** |  | **Total population of the Bronx** | **1,332,650** |  |\n|  |  |  | ***All born abroad or overseas*** ‡ | **524,410** | ***39.4%*** |\n|  |  |  | Puerto Rico | 126,649 | *9.5%* |\n| ***Foreign-born Whites*** | **477,342** | ***37.7%*** | ***All foreign-born*** | **385,827** | ***29.0%*** |\n| White persons born in Russia | 135,210 | *10.7%* | Dominican Republic | 124,032 | *9.3%* |\n| White persons born in Italy | 67,732 | *5.4%* | Jamaica | 51,120 | *3.8%* |\n| White persons born in Poland | 55,969 | *4.4%* | Mexico | 20,962 | *1.6%* |\n| White persons born in Germany | 43,349 | *3.4%* | Guyana | 14,868 | *1.1%* |\n| White persons born in the Irish Free State † | 34,538 | *2.7%* | Ecuador | 14,800 | *1.1%* |\n| Other foreign birthplaces of Whites | 140,544 | *11.1%* | Other foreign birthplaces | 160,045\n | *12.0%* |\n| † the 26 counties now within the Republic of Ireland |  ‡ beyond the 50 states & District of Columbia |\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** (1) **Population 1920-1990:** Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990, Compiled and edited by Richard L.

The vast majority of the borough's African American and Hispanic residents live north of the Staten Island Expressway, or Interstate 278.\n\n\n\n### 2009 American community survey[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Staten Island Population by year**\n| \n\n| Year\n | Inhabitants\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900 | 67,021\n |\n| 1910 | 85,969\n |\n| 1920 | 116,531\n |\n| 1930 | 158,346\n |\n| 1940 | 174,441\n |\n| 1950 | 191,555\n |\n| 1960 | 221,991\n |\n| 1970 | 295,443\n |\n| 1980 | 352,029\n |\n| 1990 | 378,977\n |\n| 2000 | 443,728\n |\n| 2010 | 468,730\n |\n| 2020 | 475,000\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau,[2] Staten Island had a population 491,730, of which 48.7% were males and 51.3% were females. Approximately 6.0% of the population was under five years of age, and 76.9% of the populace was over eighteen years of age. One-eighth (12.5%) of the population was over sixty-five years of age. The median age was 38.4 years.\n\n\nIn terms of race, 98.1% of the population was of one race and 1.9% was of two or more races. The borough's population was 75.7% White (65.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 10.2% Black or African American (9.6% non-Hispanic Black or African American alone), 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.4% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 4.6% from Some other race, and 1.9% from Two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 15.9% of the population.\n\n\nWhites were the racial majority in Staten Island. Of the borough's 491,000 people, over 382,000 were white, which was over three-quarters (75.7%) of the population. Over 323,000 non-Hispanic whites reside in the borough, and they make up 65.8% of the population. The Caucasian population was largely Italian and Irish. Sizable communities of Germans, Russians, Albanians and Poles were present. There were over 175,000 Italian Americans living in Staten Island, and they make up over one-third (35.7%) of the population. Roughly 65,000 Irish Americans live in the borough, and they make up over one-eighth (13.2%) of the population. People of German, Russian, and Polish descent make up 5.7, 3.8, and 3.4% of the population, respectively.\n\n\nCompared to other New York City boroughs, Blacks were a relatively small percentage of Staten Island's residents. Only one out of every ten residents was Black compared to one out of every four residents in New York City overall. Of the borough's 50,000 Black residents, 47,000 were non-Hispanic, which was just under ten percent of the population. In addition, over 7,200 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, which was equal to 1.5% of Staten Island's total population.\n\n\nAmerican Indians were a very small minority in Staten Island. Of the borough's 491,000 inhabitants, just over 900 were Native American. Overall, indigenous peoples make up only 0.2% of the population. People of mixed white and Native American ancestry & mixed black and Native American ancestry collectively outnumber people who were Native American alone. Over 630 people were of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage, and over 410 people were of mixed African American and Native American heritage.\n\n\nAsians were a smaller minority group compared to blacks and Hispanics, but they were visible and growing. Over 36,600 Asians call Staten Island home, and they represent 7.4% of the borough's population. Chinese Americans and Indian Americans were the two main Asian ethnic groups. Over 12,100 Chinese Americans and 10,000 Indian Americans live in the conurbation. People of Chinese and Indian descent make up 2.5 and 2.0% of the population, respectively. Over 7,700 Filipinos reside here, making up 1.6% of the population. Staten Island was also home to the nations highest percentages of Sri Lankans. The **Little Sri Lanka** in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island was one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.[3][4]\n\n\nHispanics and Latinos were the largest minority group in Staten Island, and they're the second largest group after non-Hispanic whites. Over 78,000 Hispanics and Latinos live in the borough, and they make up 15.9% of the population. Puerto Ricans were the most numerous of the Hispanic subgroups; the borough's 35,600 Puerto Ricans make up 7.2% of its population. In addition, the borough's 15,300 Mexicans make up 3.1% of its population; over 1,200 Cubans form just 0.3% of Staten Island's population. In addition, over 26,100 people were of other Hispanic and Latino ethnicities, such as Dominican, Salvadoran, Ecuadorian etc.\n\n\nApproximately 80.0% of the population was native and 20.0% was foreign-born. About 78.2% of the population was born in the United States, and 1.8% was born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or abroad to American parents. The 98,000 foreign-born make up one-fifth of the population. Approximately 34.7% of the foreign-born population was born in Europe, 29.4% was born in Asia, 27.6% was born in Latin America, 7.8% was born in Africa, 0.4% was born in other parts of North America, and 0.1% was born in Oceania.\n\n\nApproximately 71.4% of the population over five years of age spoke English only at home, so 28.6% of the population spoke non-English languages. In addition, 10.1% of the population spoke Spanish, and 12.1% spoke other Indo-European languages. Lastly, 4.6% of the populace spoke an Asian language.\n\n\n\n### 2010 census[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 64.0% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 9.5%[1] non-Hispanic Black or African American, 0.0% non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.2% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 2.6% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 17.3% of Staten Island's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nOut of all of the boroughs of NYC, Staten Island has the lowest population concentration and as of the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were a total population of 495,747 residents with 277,981 White residents making up 56.1%, 96,960 Hispanic residents making up 19.6%, 58,753 Asian residents making up 11.9%, and 46,835 Black residents making up 9.4%. Through most of the 20th century, NYC has long been dominantly populated by European American White enclaves, but starting in the 1970s and moving forward, there was a rapid increasing changing cultural and racial diversity in the city and by the 1980s going forward, Non-White enclaves became the dominant majority of the city while the overall white population fell under 50% including in each other borough, however Staten Island is the only and last borough of NYC that is still retaining a more than 50% White European American majority despite the increasing cultural and racial diversity.[5][6][7][8] However, Staten Island's White population has been steadily declining from 300,169 residents at 64.0% in 2010 to 277,981 at 56.1% in 2020, a loss of -22,188 or -7.4%, meanwhile other racial populations are increasing with the Black population increasing from 44,313 residents at 9.5% in 2010 to 46,835 residents at 9.4% in 2020, a gain of 2,522 residents or 5.7%, though due to other racial population increases in the borough, the percentage portion of the Black residents out of the total Staten Island population slightly declined, the Hispanic population went from 81,051 residents at 17.3% in 2010 to 96,960 residents at 19.6%, a gain of 15,909 residents or 19.6%, and the Asian population experienced the largest increase from 34,697 residents at 7.4% in 2010 to 58,753 residents at 11.9% in 2020, a gain of 24,056 residents or 69.3%.[9]\n\n\n\n## Major racial groups[edit]\n\n\n### Italian Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island has a higher percentage of Italian Americans than any other county in the United States, though it is 27th largest compared to other Italian American communities.[10]\n\n\nAbout 35.7% of Staten Island's residents have Italian origin. The South Shore of Staten Island has the highest proportion of Italians. Nearly 80% of the South Shore reports Italian ancestry. Several neighborhoods in the southernmost portion of the island are over 90% Italian.[2]\n\n\nA large number of Italian Americans and their descendants on Staten Island are transplants who migrated from Brooklyn in the 1960s following the construction of the Verrazzano Bridge. Only a few are Italian-born.\n\n\n\n### Asian Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Staten Island has a 7.4% non-Hispanic Asian population. The Asian population was mostly concentrated in the areas alongside the Staten Island Expressway. The area around Bradley Avenue has the highest concentration of Asians on Staten Island (Census tract 187.02 has a 24% Asian population, and census tract 189.02 has a 23% Asian population). Other areas with a small concentration of Asians were Graniteville, Willowbrook, Concord, Castleton Corners, Park Hill, Rosebank, South Beach, and Grasmere. There was also a small Asian concentration in Mariners' Harbor (Census Tract 231 was 13% Asian).[11]\n\n\n\n### Hispanic Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island's Hispanic population was 17.3% as of the 2010 census. While Hispanics can be found in most Staten Island neighborhoods, their concentrations were highest north of the Staten Island Expressway. Roughly half of Staten Island's Hispanics were of Puerto Rican descent. However, the majority of the Hispanics residing in the Port Richmond area were Mexican:[12]\n\n\nThere were 2 census tracts with a Hispanic majority. Census tract 207 in northern Port Richmond was 53% Hispanic, and census tract 133.02 in northern West Brighton was 51% Hispanic. Census tract 213 in Port Richmond was 45% Hispanic, though the Hispanic percentage was brought down due to the area east of Port Richmond Avenue being majority White (though with a noticeable Hispanic presence). Other neighborhoods with a large Hispanic population include Mariners' Harbor, Arlington, Elm Park, Graniteville, New Brighton, St. George, Ward Hill, Stapleton, Park Hill, and Rosebank.\n\n\nHispanics were the fastest growing ethnic group on Staten Island. The Hispanic population has increased 51% between the 2000 & 2010 census.\n\n\n\n### African Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island has the lowest percentage of Black residents as of the 2010 census, at only 9.5%. Most African Americans reside north of the Staten Island Expressway. The only census tracts having Black majorities were tracts 319.01, 319.02, and 133.01. Tract 133.01 is the West Brighton Houses (though a few residential homes along Alaska Street were also included), and census tracts 319.01 & 319.02 were in the western portion of Mariners' Harbor (Tract 319.02 was often referred to as Arlington). Back in 2000, tracts 4 & 29 in Park Hill/Stapleton had a Black majority, but that was no longer the case, due to an increasing Hispanic and Asian population in the area.\n\n\nSome other areas had a noticeable Black presence, although Blacks do not make up the majority (or even a plurality in most cases). These neighborhoods include Mariners' Harbor, Elm Park, Port Richmond, West New Brighton, New Brighton, St. George, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, Ward Hill, Park Hill & Sandy Ground as well as a growing population in Graniteville.\n\n\nWhile many African Americans living on Staten Island were descendants of Southern-born migrants of The Great Migration, a small contingent of free African Americans settled in Sandy Ground in the 1830s. Aside from this, others were American-born transplants from other boroughs and Southern and Midwestern states. Others were immigrants, or descendants of immigrants, from West Africa and the Caribbean.\n\n\nThe island houses more Liberians than anywhere outside Liberia,[13] and has included three Liberian heads of state: David D. Kpormakpor, Ruth Perry, and George Weah.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 70.39% (306,310) of Staten Island residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 10.02% (43,587) spoke Spanish, 3.14% (13,665) Russian, 3.11% (13,542) Italian, 2.39% (10,412) Chinese, 1.81% (7,867) other Indo-European languages, 1.38% (5,990) Arabic, 1.01% (4,390) Polish, 0.88% (3,812) Korean, 0.80% (3,500) Tagalog, 0.76% (3,308) other Asian languages, 0.62% (2,717) Urdu, 0.57% (2,479) other Indic languages, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.56% (2,458) of the population over the age of five. In total, 29.61% (128,827) of Staten Island's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[14]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of religion, the population is largely Roman Catholic, and the Catholic Church exerts strong influence on many aspects of the island's social and cultural life. The Jewish community is large enough that it would be significant in most other parts of the country, but it is slightly less numerous compared to other parts of the New York Metropolitan Area.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"United States Census Quick Facts: Richmond County, New York\".

For a long time, the Asian population in the borough had always been at the lowest ranking in the borough, but in 2020, for the first time in history, the Asian population has surpassed the Black population in the borough, meanwhile the Black population has now fallen to the lowest population ranking. The Hispanic population still makes up the largest non-white population in the borough.[9][10]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, only the White and Asian populations and other racial group populations increased while the Hispanic and Black populations declined. Of the population gains from 2010 to 2020, the White population went from 761,493 residents at 48.0% to 793,294 residents at 46.8%, a gain of 31,801 residents or 4.2%, though because of increases from other racial groups, the White population percentage portion out of the total Manhattan population did slightly drop, the Asian population went from 177,624 residents at 11.2% to 219,624 residents at 13.0%, a gain of 42,000 or 23.6% and they contributed to the largest increase in population in the borough, Some Other Race population went from 7,882 residents at 0.5% to 16,112 residents at 1.0%, a gain of 8,230 residents or 104.4%, the multiracial population went from 29,957 residents at 1.9% to 62,989 residents at 3.7%, a gain of 33,032 residents or 110.3%. Of the population declines from 2010 to 2020, the Hispanic population went from 403,577 residents at 25.4% to 402,640 residents at 23.8% a decline of -937 residents or -0.2, though the Hispanic population decline was very minor whereas the Black population had the largest decline of all racial groups in Manhattan going from 205,340 residents at 12.9% to 199,592 residents at 11.8%, a decline of -5,748 residents or -2.8%.[11]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2010 census[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2010 Census, there were 1,585,873 people living in Manhattan, an increase of 3.2% since 2000. Since 2010, Manhattan's population was estimated by the Census Bureau to have increased 2.5% to 1,626,159 as of 2013, representing 19.3% of the city's population and 8.3% of the state's population.[12][13]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 48.0% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 12.9% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 0.1% non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, 11.2% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.3% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.9% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 25.4% of Manhattan's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).[14]\n\n\nManhattan has the second highest percentage of non-Hispanic Whites (48%) of New York City's boroughs, after Staten Island (where non-Hispanic Whites make 64.0% of the residents).\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2000 census[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2000 census, there were 1,537,195 people, 738,644 households, and 302,105 families residing in the county. The population density was 25,859.8/km2 (66,951/mi2). There were 798,144 housing units at an average density of 13,421.8/km2 (34,756.7/mi2). The racial makeup of the county was 54.36% White (45.79% White Non-Hispanic), 9.40% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 17.39% African American, 0.50% Native American, 14.14% from other races, and 4.14% from two or more races. 27.18% of the population were Hispanic of any race. 29.43% of the population was foreign born; of this, 48.4% came from Latin America, 27.1% from Asia, 18.4% from Europe and 6.1% from other parts of the world.[15]\n\n\nThe census of 2000 showed that the neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan (i.e., Manhattan south of Houston street) had a sharply different population than the rest of the borough with 41% Asian, 32% white (non-Hispanic), 19% Hispanic, and 6% black. In addition, 43% of the inhabitants were immigrants. The high number of immigrants are related to those in Chinatown, whose population accounts for 55% of the total of Lower Manhattan. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## 2009 American community survey[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Manhattan\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, White Americans made up 58.9% of Manhattan's population; non-Hispanic whites made up 50.7% of the population. Black Americans made up 15.5% of Manhattan's population; non-Hispanic blacks made up 13.0% of the population; Native Americans made up 0.3% of the population; Asian Americans made up 10.3% of the population; Multiracial Americans made up 3.4% of the population; Hispanics and Latinos made up 23.8% of Manhattan's population.[16]\nWhite Americans are the largest racial group in Manhattan; whites make up 58.9% of the borough's population. Whites of non-Hispanic origin form a slight majority, making up 50.7% of the population. Of Manhattan's 1,630,000 people, 960,000 are white, of which 825,000 are non-Hispanic whites. Manhattan's white population is ethnically heterogeneous. German Americans are the largest Euro-American ethnic group in the borough, making up 7.2% of the population. Irish Americans and Italian Americans make up 6.9% and 5.5% of the population, respectively. Russian Americans are also sizable, making up 6.2% of the populace.

The percentage of Blacks in Manhattan has continually been on the decline since the end of World War II.[*citation needed*] This is in large part due to the exodus of Black residents from Harlem which peaked in population in 1950[*citation needed*] and the establishment of Black communities in the other boroughs such as Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Southeast Queens, and the Northeast Bronx. Blacks of non-Hispanic origin form 13.0% of the population. Roughly 253,000 are black, of which 211,000 are non-Hispanic blacks. Roughly 27,000 residents reported their ancestry as *Sub-Saharan African* in the survey, which is equal to 1.6% of Manhattan's population. Included in the African descendant population in Harlem are African immigrants and Afro-Caribbeans from the West Indies. Harlem has seen a pattern of gentrification and a wave of new businesses came to the section during the 1990s and it is home of an increasingly large upper-class of all races, but the majority happen to be African-American.[18][19]\n\n\nNative Americans are one of the borough's smallest ethnic minority groups. Only 5,500 individuals of the borough's 1.6 million people are Native Americans. The number of Native Americans who are of non-Hispanic origin is even smaller. Roughly 1,370 residents are Native Americans of non-Hispanic descent, which is 0.1% of the population. In addition, people who are of mixed Caucasian and Native American ancestry make up 0.2% of the population. There are a number of Mohawks indigenous to the New York city area and/or Upstate New York, and many Mohawks arrived in the 1930s to work in the skyscraper building construction industry.[20][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Manhattan Chinatown\nAsian Americans are one of the borough's larger racial groups. Asians represent 10.3% of Manhattan's population. Asians of non-Hispanic origin make up 10.2% of the population. Like the Caucasian population, the Asian population is ethnically heterogeneous. Chinese Americans make up the majority of the Asian population. Of Manhattan's 168,000 Asians, some 90,000 are of Chinese descent (5.6% of the population). Roughly 21,000 residents are of Indian descent. Manhattan is home to over 16,300 Koreans, 15,200 Japanese, 11,800 Filipinos, and nearly 3,000 Vietnamese.\n\n![](image)32nd street in Manhattan's Koreatown, 2009.\nPacific Islander Americans are, by far, the smallest racial minority group in Manhattan. Just over 540 people identified themselves as such. Also, just above 270 individuals are Pacific Islanders of non-Hispanic origin.\n\n\nMultiracial Americans are a smaller minority group in Manhattan, but they are sizable. Nearly 55,000 multiracial individuals call Manhattan home, and they make up 3.4% of the population. People of European American and African American heritage form 1.4% of the population, and number over 22,200 individuals. In addition, people of Caucasian and Asian heritage make up 0.8% of the population, and number over 13,400 individuals. People of African American and Native American heritage make up 0.1% of the population, and they number at nearly 1,800 individuals.\n\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans are the largest ethnic minority group in Manhattan. Over 387,000 Hispanics and Latinos represent 23.8% of Manhattan's total population. Significant groups include Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Mexicans; Puerto Ricans make up 6.7% of the population, and number over 109,000 individuals. Mexicans make up 2.7% of the population, and number over 43,000 individuals. In addition, the borough is home to over 10,000 Cubans; people of Cuban descent form 0.6% of the population. Lastly, there are over 224,000 Hispanics that are of other ethnic groups, such as Ecuadorian, Salvadoran, etc. These people collectively make up 13.8% of the population. Hispanics are numerous throughout the borough but most prominently in East Harlem, Loisada, and Washington Heights.[16][21]\n\n\n\n## Household income[edit]\n\n\nThere were 738,644 households, out of which 17.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 25.2% were married couples living together, 12.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 59.1% were non-families. 48.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Males had a median income of $51,856 versus $45,712 for females. The per capita income for the county was $42,922. About 17.6% of families and 20.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.8% of those under age 18 and 18.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\nManhattan is one of the highest-income places in the United States with a population over 1,000,000. In particular the Upper East Side, ZIP Code 10021, with over 100,000 inhabitants and a per capita income of over $90,000, is one of the largest concentrations of wealth in the entire United States, although this is offset by a high cost of living[*citation needed*]. Like all large US cities, Manhattan does have some large enclaves of concentrated poverty.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 59.98% (902,267) of Manhattan residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 23.07% (347,033) spoke Spanish, 5.33% (80,240) Chinese, 2.03% (30,567) French, 0.78% (11,776) Japanese, 0.77% (11,517) Russian, 0.72% (10,788) Korean, 0.70% (10,496) German, 0.66% (9,868) Italian, 0.64% (9,555) Hebrew, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.48% (7,158) of the population over the age of five. In total, 40.02% (602,058) of Manhattan's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[23]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nNew York County is diverse religiously and ethnically. According to a report by The Association of Religion Data,[24] the largest religious affiliation in Manhattan is the Roman Catholic Church, whose adherents constitute 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the population) and maintain 110 congregations. Jewish-Americans comprise the second largest religious group, with 314,500 persons (around 20.5%), and have 102 congregations. Other large denominations include Protestants (139,732 adherents) and Muslims (37,078).\n\n\n\n## Population density[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population density of New York County was 74,870.7 inhabitants per square mile (28,907.7/km2), the highest population density of any county in the United States.[5] In 1910, at the height of European immigration to New York, Manhattan's population density reached a peak of 101,548 people per square mile (39,208 people/km2).[5][13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of New York City\n* Demographics of New York (state)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"A Story Map: 2020 Census Demographic Data Map Viewer\".

Since 2010, the population of Brooklyn was estimated by the Census Bureau to have increased 3.5% to 2,592,149 as of 2013, representing 30.8% of New York City's population, 33.5% of Long Island's population, and 13.2% of New York State's population.[2][3][4][5][6] If the boroughs of New York City were separate cities, Brooklyn would be the third largest city in the United States after Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 35.7% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 31.9% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 10.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.4% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.6% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 19.8% of Brooklyn's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).\n\n\nIn the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were a total of 2,736,074 residents with 968,427 White residents making up 35.4%, 729,696 Black residents making up 26.7%, 516,426 Hispanic residents making up 18.9%, and 370,776 Asian residents making up 13.6%.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Households[edit]\n\n\nOf its 880,727 households 33.3% have children under the age of 18 living in them, 38.6% were married couples living together, 22.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.7% were non-families. Of all households 27.8% are made up of individuals, and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.41.\n\n\nIn the county the population was spread out, with 26.9% under the age of 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.5% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. For every 100 females there were 88.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.1 males.\n\n\n\n## Income[edit]\n\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $32,135, and the median income for a family was $36,188. Males had a median income of $34,317 versus $30,516 for females. The per capita income for the county was $16,775. About 22.0% of families and 25.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 34.0% of those under age 18 and 21.5% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n\n## Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Race | Number2000\n | %  | Number2010[9] | %  | Number2020[10] | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White |  |  |  |  | 1,028,774\n | 37.60%\n |\n|  > non-Hispanic Whites | 854,532 | 34.66% | 893,306 | 35.66% | 968,427 | 35.40% |\n| Black |  |  |  |  | 772,050\n | 28.22%\n |\n|  > non-Hispanic Blacks | 848,583 | 34.42% | 799,066 | 29.13% | 729,696 | 26.67%  |\n| Asian | 184,291\n | 7.47%\n | 260,129\n | 10.38%\n | 370,776\n | 13.55%\n |\n| American Indian and Alaska natives | 4,494\n | 0.18%\n | 4,638\n | 0.18%\n | 3,964\n | 0.14%\n |\n| Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders\n | 803\n | 0.03%\n | 633\n | 0.02%\n | 718\n | 0.03%\n |\n| Some other\n | 16,057\n | 0.65%\n | 10,633\n | 0.42%\n | 32,897\n | 1.20%\n |\n| Two or more\n | 68,688\n | 2.78%\n | 40,010\n | 1.60%\n | 113,170\n | 4.13%\n |\n| *Hispanic* (of any race)\n | *487,878* | *19.79%* | *496,285* | *19.81%* | *516,426* | *18.87%* |\n| **Total** | **2,465,326** | **100%** | **2,504,700** | **100%** | **2,736,074** | **100%** |\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, White Americans made up 54.6% of Brooklyn's population. Black Americans made up 34.2% of Brooklyn's population; non-Hispanic black people made up 32.9% of the population. Native Americans made up 0.3% of Brooklyn's population.

Hispanic and Latino Americans made up 19.6% of Brooklyn's population.[11]\n\n\n\n### European Americans[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Whites (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic) number near 1.3 million individuals, and there are nearly 1,150,000 non-Hispanic whites residing in Brooklyn. Brooklyn's European American population mainly consists of ethnic Europeans who are either from or descendants from Eastern and Southern European countries of Italy, Russia, Poland, Albania, and former Soviet Union countries, as well as Ireland, Germany and Scandinavia. Northwest and the Southern half sections of Brooklyn are predominantly European American communities, and most of the borough's European American residents are of the Catholic or Jewish faith. Amongst Catholics, Italian Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bergen Beach, and Mill Basin. Polish Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Greenpoint (\"Little Poland\") and Greenwood Heights; Russian Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay; and Irish Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Bay Ridge, Gerritsen Beach, and Marine Park. Brooklyn is 22.4% Jewish[12] with Jews being the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Borough Park, Williamsburg, Midwood, Ocean Parkway, a portion of Crown Heights, and a portion of Flatbush.\n\n\nNeighborhoods surrounding Bedford-Stuyvesant such as Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Canarsie, and East New York were previously overwhelmingly majority Jewish and Italian with Germans and Irish in some sections in early-mid 20th century, but in the later part of the 20th century they slowly shifted into majority Black communities with a few Puerto Rican communities interspersed in Bushwick and a portion of East New York.[13] Though Bedford-Stuyvesant itself at one point in the early part of the 20th century did have large Italian and Jewish populations.[14][15] However, a section of Crown Heights and a section of Flatbush still have significant remaining small Jewish enclaves.[16][17][18] A subsection neighborhood of East New York called Starrett City or Spring Creek still have significant scattered numbers of European Americans.[19] However, in recent decades since the 2000s and especially since the 2010s, the White population has started to rapidly regrow in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Bushwick, and Flatbush, which these areas are undergoing gentrification.[20][21]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, the six most common European ancestries were the following.[22]\n\n\nAs according to the 2020 census data, the White European American population in Brooklyn increased from 893,306 residents at 35.7% in 2010 to 968,427 residents at 35.4% in 2020 a gain of 75,121 residents or 8.4%, though the percentage portion of White residents out of the total population of Brooklyn slightly declined due to other racial populations increasing adding to the population.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ancestry\n | Number\n | % of total population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Italian | 157,068\n | 6.1%\n |\n| Irish | 100,923\n | 3.9%\n |\n| Russian | 88,766\n | 3.5%\n |\n| Polish | 71,099\n | 2.8%\n |\n| German | 53,188\n | 2.1%\n |\n| English | 36,174\n | 1.4%\n |\n\n\n### African Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, African Americans made up over one-third (34.2%) of Brooklyn's population. There are over 877,000 African Americans residing in Brooklyn. The historical cultural center of the borough has long been Bedford-Stuyvesant; African Americans became a majority in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the 1930s following the construction of the A line subway between Harlem and Bedford. Bedford-Stuyvesant was the first large African American community to be established in Brooklyn back then.[24] After Bedford-Stuyvesant had largely developed into an African American community in the 1930s-40s, neighborhoods surrounding Bedford-Stuyvesant in Northern and Eastern Brooklyn such as Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Canarsie, East Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, East New York, and Fort Greene had continued to be mostly home to Italian and Jewish enclaves with some Germans and Irish intermixed in even though some of the growing African American population also did spillover into some of these neighborhoods, however through the processes of a Ripple effect, a Domino effect, and a Snowball effect, starting in the 1950s and throughout the remaining 20th century, these surrounding neighborhoods became the next following areas to slowly transition to majority African American communities going through neighborhood by neighborhood and going through decade by decade, though large West Indian Black communities have also emerged and intertwined in some of these areas. As a result, a very large portion of the northern half of Brooklyn are dominantly populated by African Americans with large West Indian Black populations intertwined in, though Crown Heights and Flatbush continue to have remaining small significant Jewish communities.[25] The roads of Eastern Parkway, Malcolm X Boulevard, Kings Highway, Broadway, Atlantic Avenue, Linden Boulevard, Flatlands Avenue and Jackie Robinson Parkway connect all of these neighborhoods to the point of being very comparatively similar to the city of Newark, New Jersey in terms of the geographic size and the dominantly Black communities.[26][27] Coney Island, which is another Brooklyn neighborhood very far into the very southern tip of Brooklyn also has a significant African American population. Together these neighborhoods have a population of about 940,000 and are roughly 82% African American, making it the largest African-American community in the United States.[28] However, the 2020 census data showed that the Black population in NYC has declined from 1,861,295 residents at 22.8% in 2010 to 1,776,891 residents at 20.2% in 2020 with a loss of -84,404 resident or -4.5%, however, Brooklyn itself had the sharpest declines of the Black population of all of the NYC boroughs going from 799,066 residents at 31.9% in 2010 to 729,696 residents at 26.7% in 2020 with a loss of -69,370 residents at -8.7%. In all of Brooklyn, the Black population was the only population to suffer significant declines while all other populations of racial groups experienced increases. Many of the Black neighborhoods in northern Brooklyn such as Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Ocean Hill, and Flatbush are now undergoing gentrification and experiencing rapid increasing regaining population of White residents, which are wealthier professionals instead of the working class European immigrants and European Americans that were previously majority populations in these neighborhoods.[29] Fort Greene, which has been a majority Black neighborhood since the 1970s though with some significant mixtures of Hispanic and White residents and very limited Asian residents has re-transitioned back to a White population majority since the 2010s though significant amount of Black residents still remain with now a slow increasing population of Asian and Hispanic residents; the last time Fort Greene had a White majority population was back in the 1960s-70s.[30][31][32][33][34][35][36]\n\n\n\n### Caribbean Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 US Census data on brooklyn.com there are approximately 370,000 (16.4%) Caribbean descendants in Brooklyn. That figure includes persons who identify with the Dominican Republic (3.3%), but does not include the (7.4%) Puerto Rican population. Including Puerto Ricans there are approximately 560,000 (23.8%) persons of Caribbean descent in Brooklyn. Similar, but not identical demographics in America can be found in Miami, but there are not as many Cubans in New York. A large population of Brooklyn's Caribbean decedents are of Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Haitian, Saint Lucians and Guyanese immigrants. As of 2017, between the neighborhoods of Flatbush, East Flatbush, and Crown Heights, it has been given a nickname called, *Little Caribbean* due to the large concentrations of Caribbean populations.[37][38][39] The adjacent neighborhood Canarsie is also another large Caribbean neighborhood, which emerged more towards the late 1990s whereas the Caribbean communities of East Flatbush, Flatbush, and Crown Heights developed much earlier around the 1960s-70s.[40]\n\n\n\n### Hispanics and Latinos[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, Hispanics and Latinos made up nearly one-fifth (19.6%) of Brooklyn's population. Over 500,000 Hispanics and Latinos reside in Brooklyn. Nearly 190,000 Puerto Ricans call the borough home, and they make up 7.4% of the population. The borough's 91,000 Mexican Americans make up 3.6% of its population. Many neighborhoods in the very Northern parts of Brooklyn are home to a high number of Hispanics mainly from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central America. Hispanics are mainly concentrated in neighborhoods in the North Central and Northeast sections of Brooklyn, though there are some spillovers of the Hispanic population into Northwestern Brooklyn such as Williamsburg.[41] Hispanics have become the majority in former African-American neighborhoods such as Bushwick, East Williamsburg and Cypress Hills. Sunset Park, in South Brooklyn is also home to a large Hispanic community. Since the 2000s, especially since the 2010s, other southern Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Dyker Heights, Gravesend, and especially in Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge have started to receive significant growing Hispanic populations as well though are more mixed in with the populations of predominantly White Americans and Asian Americans.[42][43][44][45]\n\n\nThe 2020 census data showed that Brooklyn's Hispanic population increased from 496,285 residents at 19.8% in 2010 to 516,426 residents at 18.9% a gain of 20,141 residents or 4.1%, though as other racial populations increased in the borough, the Hispanic population percentage portion decreased slightly.[46][47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brooklyn Chinatown\n### Asian Americans[edit]\n\n\nOver 243,000 Asians live in the borough. The most numerous Asian American group are those of Chinese descent. Chinese Americans make up 6.4% of the borough's population, and they number over 163,000 individuals. Much of Brooklyn's Asian population is concentrated in Southern Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Sunset Park (\"Brooklyn's Chinatown\"), Homecrest, Sheepshead Bay (\"Avenue U Chinatown\") and Bensonhurst. (\"Bensonhurst Chinatown\")[48] The Chinese were second only to Queens among New York boroughs, meaning Manhattan's Chinatown is no longer the main residence of Chinese in the city. Initially, Sunset Park was the primary destination for the newly arriving Chinese immigrants, many fleeing from the original Manhattan's Chinatown during the 1980s-90s and most of them were Cantonese speaking immigrants creating the original Brooklyn's Chinatown, however since the 2000s, a large influx of Fuzhou speaking immigrants have become the largest Chinese group population in Sunset Park expanding the Sunset Park Chinatown dramatically and now being given the name, *Brooklyn's Little Fuzhou* and since then, Cantonese speaking immigrants in Brooklyn including new arrivals have been dramatically shifting to and concentrating in Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay/Homecrest creating newer Chinatowns of Brooklyn or *Brooklyn's Little Hong Kong/Guangdong*.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\nApproximately 19,851 Asian Indians live in Brooklyn. Approximately 9,681 Filipino Americans live in Brooklyn. Approximately 6,977 Korean Americans reside here. Brooklyn has the most Vietnamese Americans of any borough, they numbered over 5,700 individuals. The 4,704 Japanese Americans rounded out Asian American groups with over 1,000 people in Brooklyn.\n\n\nThere is a sizable Pakistani American community in the Midwood section of Brooklyn[53] and there is a \"Little Pakistan\" on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn.[54] Pakistanis are concentrated heavily in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, and are one of the fastest growing Asian ethnic groups in Brooklyn .[55] Pakistanis number around 30,000 and counting in Brooklyn and their community is growing rapidly. Many halal restaurants, fabric stores, Pakistani clothing stores and mosques are centered on Coney Island Avenue.[56]\n\n\nCurrently, the Brooklyn Asian enclaves are scattered and intertwined with the predominant European American communities in southern Brooklyn. Many Bangladeshis are now living here\n\n\nThe 2020 census data showed that the Asian population grew the fastest of all racial groups in Brooklyn going from 260,129 residents at 10.4% in 2010 to 370,776 residents at 13.6% in 2020 with a gain of 110,647 residents or 42.5% [57]\n\n\n\n### Arab Americans[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Bay Ridge currently holds the highest percentage of Arab Americans, with its main thoroughfare being 5th avenue. Other neighborhoods include Boerum Hill, which historically held the largest Yemeni population, but now many Yemeni Americans have moved to Bay Ridge due to the increase of rent in Boerum Hill. Bensonhurst, Bath Beach, parts of Sunset Park, Dyker Heights Park Slope, and East New York also hold a large amount of Arab Americans.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brooklyn has been the city's largest borough since the mid-1920s. (Key: Each borough's historical population in millions. **The Bronx**, **Brooklyn**, **Manhattan**, **Queens**, **Staten Island**)\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nBrooklyn has a high degree of linguistic diversity. As of 2010, 54.12% (1,240,416) of Brooklyn residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 17.16% (393,340) spoke Spanish, 6.46% (148,012) Chinese, 5.31% (121,607) Russian, 3.47% (79,469) Yiddish, 2.75% (63,019) French Creole, 1.35% (31,004) Italian, 1.20% (27,440) Hebrew, 1.01% (23,207) Polish, 0.99% (22,763) French, 0.95% (21,773) Arabic, 0.85% (19,388) various Indic languages, 0.99% (22,763) Turkish, 0.70% (15,936) Urdu, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.54% (12,305) of the population over the age of five.

No racial or ethnic group holds a majority in the borough.\n\n\nCoterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (behind Brooklyn), with approximately 2.3 million residents in 2013, approximately 48% of them foreign-born;[1] Queens County is also the second most populous county in New York State, behind neighboring Kings County, which is coterminous with the borough of Brooklyn. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States; and if each New York City borough were an independent city, Queens would also be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn.[2] Some say Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## General statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nQueens County  \nHistorical Population Figures[4][5][6]\n| CensusYear | Queens(old) | Nassauportion | Queens(new) | %increase |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1698 | 3,565 |  |  |  |\n| 1771 | 10,980 |  |  |  |\n| 1790 | 16,014 | 9,855 | 6,159 | -\n |\n| 1800 | 16,916 | 10,274 | 6,642 | 7.8%\n |\n| 1810 | 19,336 | 11,892 | 7,444 | 12.1%\n |\n| 1820 | 21,519 | 13,273 | 8,246 | 10.8%\n |\n| 1830 | 22,460 | 13,411 | 9,049 | 9.7%\n |\n| 1840 | 30,324 | 15,844 | 14,480 | 60.0%\n |\n| 1850 | 36,833 | 18,240 | 18,593 | 28.4%\n |\n| 1860 | 57,391 | 24,488 | 32,903 | 77.0%\n |\n| 1870 | 73,803 | 28,335 | 45,468 | 38.2%\n |\n| 1880 | 90,574 | 34,015 | 56,559 | 24.4%\n |\n| 1890 | 128,059 | 41,009 | 87,050 | 53.9%\n |\n| 1900 |  |  | 152,999 | 75.8%\n |\n| 1910 |  |  | 284,041 | 85.6%\n |\n| 1920 |  |  | 469,042 | 65.1%\n |\n| 1930 |  |  | 1,079,129 | 130.1%\n |\n| 1940 |  |  | 1,297,634 | 20.2%\n |\n| 1950 |  |  | 1,550,849 | 19.5%\n |\n| 1960 |  |  | 1,809,578 | 16.7%\n |\n| 1970 |  |  | 1,986,473 | 9.8%\n |\n| 1980 |  |  | 1,891,325 | -4.8%\n |\n| 1990 |  |  | 1,951,598 | 3.2%\n |\n| 2000 |  |  | 2,229,379 | 14.2%\n |\n| 2010 |  |  | 2,230,722 | 0.1%\n |\n| 2020 |  |  | 2,405,464 | 7.8%\n |\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nSince 2021, the population of Queens was estimated by the Census Bureau to have decreased 0.9% to 2,287,390 as of 2021, representing 27.3% of New York City's population, and 11.7% of New York State's population.[7][8][9][10][11] In the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were a total population of 2,405,464 residents.

According to the 2009 American Community Survey, Black people of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin made up 18.8% of Queens' population.[18] As of 2010, Black people of non-Hispanic origin formed 17.7% non-Hispanic of the population. Over 434,300 black people reside in Queens, of which some 406,000 are non-Hispanic. In addition, 23,527 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, which is equal to 1.0% of the population. Black people are the majority in Queensbridge and LeFrak City but primarily concentrated in the Southeast Queens neighborhoods of South Jamaica, Springfield Gardens, Hollis, Laurelton, Cambria Heights, Locust Manor, St. Albans, Rosedale, and Far Rockaway.\n\n\nThe Black and African American population declined from 395,881 residents at 17.7% in 2010 to 381,375 residents at 15.9% in 2020, a loss of -14,506 residents or -3.7%.[17]\n\n\n\n## Native American population[edit]\n\n\nNative Americans are a very small minority in Queens. Of the borough's 2.3 million people, roughly 11,200 are Native American, which is equivalent to just 0.5% of the total population. However, people who identify as Native American with another racial group (and those who are Native American alone) make up 1.1% of the population, which is roughly 25,700 people.\n\n\n\n## Asian population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queens Library in Flushing Chinatown\nAsians have a large presence in Queens, and Queens has the largest Asian American population by county outside the Western United States; according to the 2006 American Community Survey, Queens ranks fifth among US counties, with 477,772 Asian Americans making up 21.18% of the population. Over one-in-five residents (22.0%) are of Asian descent. Over 506,000 Asians live in the borough. The bulk of this group are composed of people of Chinese, Indian, Korean, and Filipino descent. Asians are numerous throughout the borough but most concentrated in Northeastern and Central Queens in areas such as Flushing, Little Neck, Bayside, Fresh Meadows, Jamaica Estates, Elmhurst, Woodside, Richmond Hill, and Ozone Park. The following list provides more information on these four ethnic groups:\n\n\n\n* Chinese: (395,009)\n* Indian: (377,696)\n* Korean: (52,690)\n* Filipino: (40,113)\n\n\nThe 2000 census also showed that the borough is home to one of the most important concentration of Indian Americans in the nation, with a total population of 329,715 ([2] Archived 2011-07-25 at the Wayback Machine. Similarly, it also has a visible presence of Bangladeshi Americans with a population of 88,310 (0.82% of the borough's population) and Pakistani Americans with a population of 75,604 ( 0.7% of the borough's population). There is also a large population of Afghan Americans, which reside predominantly in Flushing and Jackson Heights, and there is also a large portion of Arab Americans which live in Astoria concentrated in and around Steinway, with groups of Moroccan Americans, Egyptian Americans, Lebanese Americans, Algerian Americans and Syrian Americans. The neighborhoods of Forest Hills, Queens, and Rego Park are home to a large amount of Central Asians, particularly Bukharian Jews from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. There is also a large population of Indo-Guyanese and Indo-Trinidadian people in Richmond Hill, Queens, Ozone Park, and South Ozone Park.Wayback Machine.\n\n\nThere are another ten Asian American groups in Queens that number over 1,000 individuals. The largest Asian American group in Queens in the year 2000 were the Chinese, numbering at 143,126 members. Those of Korean descent numbered at 63,885 in the borough. There were 33,225 people of Filipino ancestry in Queens. The borough is also home to 5,957 Japanese Americans. Those of Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai, and Taiwanese descent also all numbered over 1,000, but under 5,000.[19] In 2022, the New York City Council designated an official \"Little Thailand\" three-block strip within Elmhurst.[20]\n\n\n\n### Notable People[edit]\n\n\n* Bill Lann Lee, American civil rights lawyer and former United States Assistant Attorney General\n* Charles Wang, American businessman and philanthropist\n* David Ren, film director, writer, & producer\n* Grace Meng, American lawyer and first member of U.S. House of Representatives of Asian descent to represent New York\n* James S.C.

[17]\n\n\n\n## Hispanic and Latino population[edit]\n\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans make up over one-quarter of Queens' population. As of 2010, 27.5% of Queens's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). Over 620,000 Hispanics and Latinos call the borough home. Over 145,500 Colombians (6.4% of the population) 123,200 Puerto Ricans (5.3% of the population) and 83,180 Mexicans (3.6% of the population) live in the borough, in addition to over 13,400 Cubans (0.6% of the population). Over 400,300 people are of other Hispanic and Latino ethnicities, such as Dominican, Salvadoran, Ecuadorian and other nationalities. These people collectively make up 17.4% of the population. Hispanics are numerous throughout the borough but concentrated most in Central Queens neighborhoods such as Corona, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Woodside, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, Flushing, and Ozone Park.\nThe following list provides more information on these ethnic groups:[18][21]\n\n\n\n* Colombians 146,000 (6.5%)\n* Puerto Ricans 123,000 (5.4%)\n* Ecuadorians 108,000 (4.8%)\n* Mexicans 81,000 (3.6%)\n* Dominicans 68,000 (3.1%)\n* Other 125,000 (5.5%)\n\n\nThis Hispanic population experienced increase from 613,750 residents at 27.5% in 2010 to 667,861 residents at 27.8% in 2020, a gain of 54,111 residents of 8.8%. For a long time, the Hispanic population was the fastest growing population in the borough, but since the 2000s to 2010s, the Asian population has taken over that status and now slowly beginning to challenge the Hispanic population as the largest immigrant population of the borough. [17][22][23]\n\n\n\n## Multiracial population[edit]\n\n\nMultiracial individuals are a small but sizable minority group in Queens. Over 55,540 multiracial individuals reside in the borough, which is equal to 2.4% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and black heritage number over 8,840 members and make up 0.4% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 4,100 members and make up 0.2% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 8,060 members and make up 0.3% of the population. Lastly, people of mixed black and Native American heritage number over 2,550 and make up 0.1% of the population. From 2010 to 2020, the multiracial population went from 56,107 residents at 2.5% to 84,112 residents at 3.5%, a gain of 28,005 residents or 49.9%. [17]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 43.84% (905,890) of Queens residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 23.88% (493,462) spoke Spanish, 8.06% (166,570) Chinese, 3.44% (71,054) various Indic languages, 2.74% (56,701) Korean, 1.67% (34,596) Russian, 1.56% (32,268) Italian, 1.54% (31,922) Tagalog, 1.53% (31,651) Greek, 1.32% (27,345) French Creole, 1.17% (24,118) Polish, 0.96% (19,868) Hindi, 0.93% (19,262) Urdu, 0.92% (18,931) other Asian languages, 0.80% (16,435) other Indo-European languages, 0.71% (14,685) French, 0.61% (12,505) Arabic, 0.48% (10,008) Serbo-Croatian, and Hebrew was spoken as a main language by 0.46% (9,410) of the population over the age of five.

Located on Long Island northeast of Brooklyn, it is the largest New York City borough by area. In addition to Brooklyn at the western tip of Long Island,[5] is bordered by Nassau County to its east. Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island and with New Jersey.[6]\n\n\nWith a population of 2,405,464 as of the 2020 census,[2] Queens is the second-most populous county in New York state, behind Kings County (Brooklyn), and is therefore also the second-most populous of the five New York City boroughs. If Queens were its own city, it would be the fourth most-populous in the U.S. after New York City itself, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated borough in New York City and the fourth-most densely populated U.S. county. About 47% of its residents are foreign-born.[7] Queens is the most linguistically diverse place on Earth and is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the United States.[8][9][10]\n\n\nQueens was established in 1683 as one of the original 12 counties of the Province of New York. The settlement was named after the English Queen and Portuguese royal princess Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705).[11] From 1683 to 1899, the County of Queens included what is now Nassau County. Queens became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898, combining the towns of Long Island City, Newtown, Flushing, Jamaica, and western Hempstead.[12] All except Hempstead are today considered neighborhoods of Queens.\n\n\nQueens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs of New York City.[13] It is home to both of New York City's airports: John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia. Among its landmarks are Flushing Meadows–Corona Park; Citi Field, home to the New York Mets baseball team; the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, site of the U.S. Open tennis tournament; Kaufman Astoria Studios; Silvercup Studios; and the Aqueduct Racetrack. Flushing is undergoing rapid gentrification with investment by Chinese transnational entities,[14] while Long Island City is undergoing gentrification secondary to its proximity across the East River from Manhattan.\n\n\nThe borough's diverse housing ranges from high-rise apartment buildings in some areas of western and central Queens, such as Forest Hills, Jackson Heights, Flushing, Astoria, and Long Island City; to lower-rise neighborhoods in the eastern part of the borough.[15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Queens.\n\n### Colonial and post-colonial history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catherine of Braganza, Queen of England\n![](image)Queens Boulevard, looking east from Van Dam Street, in 1920. The newly built IRT Flushing Line is in the boulevard's median.\nThe first European settlement in the region was the Dutch, who established the colony of New Netherland. The first settlements were established in 1635 followed by further settlement at Maspeth in 1642 (ultimately unsuccessful),[17] and Vlissingen (now Flushing) in 1645.[18] Other early settlements included Newtown (now Elmhurst) in 1652 and Jamaica in 1655. However, these towns were mostly inhabited by English settlers from New England via eastern Long Island (Suffolk County) who were subject to Dutch law.[19] After the capture of the colony by the English and its subsequent renaming as *New York* in 1664, the area (and all of Long Island) became known as Yorkshire.[20]: xi–xii\n\n\nThe Flushing Remonstrance signed by colonists in 1657 is considered a precursor to the United States Constitution's provision on freedom of religion in the Bill of Rights. The signers protested the Dutch colonial authorities' persecution of Quakers in what is today the borough of Queens.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Long Island |\n| ![](image) |\n| \nTopics |\n| * Geography\n* History\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Transportation\n* Politics\n* People\n* Tallest buildings\n* Recreation\n* Law enforcement\n* Viticulture\n |\n| \nRegions |\n| * Brooklyn\n* Queens\n* Nassau County\n* Suffolk County\n* Municipalities\n* North Shore\n* South Shore\n* North Fork\n* South Fork\n* Long Island Sound\n* Barrier islands\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nOriginally, Queens County included the adjacent area now comprising Nassau County. It was an original county of New York State, one of twelve created on November 1, 1683.[20]: 121–122 The county is presumed to have been named after Catherine of Braganza, since she was queen of England at the time (she was Portugal's royal princess Catarina, daughter of King John IV of Portugal).[11] The county was founded alongside Kings County (Brooklyn, which was named after her husband, King Charles II), and Richmond County (Staten Island, named after his illegitimate son, the 1st Duke of Richmond).[21][22][23] However, the namesake is disputed. While Catherine's title seems the most likely namesake, no historical evidence of official declaration has been found.[24] On October 7, 1691, all counties in the Colony of New York were redefined. Queens gained North and South Brother Islands as well as Huletts Island (today known as Rikers Island).[20]: 268 On December 3, 1768, Queens gained other islands in Long Island Sound that were not already assigned to a county but that did not abut on Westchester County (today's Bronx County).[20]: 1062–1063\n\n\nQueens played a minor role in the American Revolution, as compared to Brooklyn, where the Battle of Long Island was largely fought. Queens, like the rest of what became New York City and Long Island, remained under British occupation after the Battle of Long Island in 1776 and was occupied throughout most of the rest of the Revolutionary War. Under the Quartering Act, British soldiers used, as barracks, the public inns and uninhabited buildings belonging to Queens residents. Even though many residents opposed unannounced quartering, they supported the British crown. The quartering of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nathan Hale was captured by the British on the shore of Flushing Bay and hanged in Manhattan.\n\n\nFrom 1683 until 1784, Queens County consisted of five towns: Flushing, Hempstead, Jamaica, Newtown, and Oyster Bay. On April 6, 1784, a sixth town, the Town of North Hempstead, was formed through secession by the northern portions of the Town of Hempstead.[25][26] The seat of the county government was located first in Jamaica,[27] but the courthouse was torn down by the British during the American Revolution to use the materials to build barracks.[28] After the war, various buildings in Jamaica temporarily served as courthouse and jail until a new building was erected about 1787 (and later completed) in an area near Mineola (now in Nassau County) known then as Clowesville.[29][30][31]\n\n\nThe 1850 United States census was the first in which the population of the three western towns exceeded that of the three eastern towns that are now part of Nassau County. Concerns were raised about the condition and distance of the old courthouse, and several sites were in contention for the construction of a new one.[32]\n\n\nIn 1870, Long Island City split from the Town of Newtown, incorporating itself as a city, consisting of what had been the village of Astoria and some unincorporated areas within the town of Newtown. Around 1874, the seat of county government was moved to Long Island City from Mineola.[33][34][35][36]\n\n\nOn March 1, 1860, the eastern border between Queens County (later Nassau County) and Suffolk County was redefined with no discernible change.[37] On June 8, 1881, North Brother Island was transferred to New York County.[38] On May 8, 1884, Rikers Island was transferred to New York County.[39]\n\n\nIn 1886, Lloyd's Neck, which was then part of the town of Oyster Bay and had earlier been known as Queens Village, was set off and separated from Queens County and annexed to the town of Huntington in Suffolk County.[40][41][42] On April 16, 1964, South Brother Island was transferred to Bronx County.[43]\n\n\n\n### Incorporation as borough[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of New York City, List of former municipalities in New York City, and List of streetcar lines in Queens\n\nThe New York City borough of Queens was authorized on May 4, 1897, by a vote of the New York State Legislature after an 1894 referendum on consolidation.[44] The eastern 280 square miles (730 km2) of Queens that became Nassau County was partitioned on January 1, 1899.[45] Queens Borough was established on January 1, 1898.[46][47][48]\n\n\n\"The city of Long Island City, the towns of Newtown, Flushing and Jamaica, and that part of the town of Hempstead, in the county of Queens, which is westerly of a straight line drawn through the middle of the channel between Rockaway Beach and Shelter Island, in the county of Queens, to the Atlantic Ocean\" was annexed to New York City,[12] dissolving all former municipal governments (Long Island City, the county government, all towns, and all villages) within the new borough.[49] The areas of Queens County that were not part of the consolidation plan,[35][50][51][52][53][54][55] consisting of the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay, and the major remaining portion of the Town of Hempstead, remained part of Queens County until they seceded to form the new Nassau County on January 1, 1899. At this point, the boundaries of Queens County and the Borough of Queens became coterminous. With consolidation, Jamaica once again became the county seat, though county offices now extend to nearby Kew Gardens also.[56]\n\n\nIn 1899, New York City conducted a land survey to determine the exact border of Queens between the Rockaways and Lawrence. This proved difficult because the border was defined as \"middle of the channel between Rockaway Beach and Shelter Island\" (now called Long Beach Island), and that particular channel had closed up by 1899. The surveyors had to determine where the channel had been when the consolidation law was written in 1894. The surveyors did so in part by speaking with local fishermen and oystermen who knew the area well.[55]\n\n\nFrom 1905 to 1908 the Long Island Rail Road in Queens became electrified. Transportation to and from Manhattan, previously by ferry or via bridges in Brooklyn, opened up with the Queensboro Bridge finished in 1909, and with railway tunnels under the East River in 1910. From 1915 onward, much of Queens was connected to the New York City Subway system.[29][57] With the 1915 construction of the Steinway Tunnel carrying the IRT Flushing Line between Queens and Manhattan, and the robust expansion of the use of the automobile, the population of Queens more than doubled in the 1920s, from 469,042 in 1920 to 1,079,129 in 1930.[58]\n\n\nIn later years, Queens was the site of the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1964 New York World's Fair. LaGuardia Airport, in northern Queens, opened in 1939. Idlewild Airport, in southern Queens and now called JFK Airport, opened in 1948. In one of several notable incidents, TWA Flight 800 took off from the airport on July 17, 1996. In another, American Airlines Flight 587 took off from the latter airport on November 12, 2001, but ended up crashing in Queens' Belle Harbor area, killing 265 people. In late October 2012, much of Queens' Breezy Point area was destroyed by a massive six-alarm fire caused by Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nLooking south from the Queensboro Bridge in Long Island City\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Location of Queens (red) within New York City\n![](image)Aerial view of Queens looking north from John F. Kennedy International Airport\nQueens is located on the far western portion of geographic Long Island and includes a few smaller islands, most of which are in Jamaica Bay, forming part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which in turn is one of the National Parks of New York Harbor.[59] According to the United States Census Bureau, Queens County has a total area of 178 square miles (460 km2), of which 109 square miles (280 km2) is land and 70 square miles (180 km2) (39%) is water.[60]\n\n\nBrooklyn, the only other New York City borough on Long Island, lies just south and west of Queens, with Newtown Creek, an estuary that flows into the East River, forming part of the border. To the west and north is the East River, across which is Manhattan to the west and The Bronx to the north. Nassau County is east of Queens on Long Island. Staten Island is southwest of Brooklyn, and shares only a three-mile-long water border (in the Outer Bay) with Queens. North of Queens are Flushing Bay and the Flushing River, connecting to the East River. The East River opens into Long Island Sound. The midsection of Queens is crossed by the Long Island straddling terminal moraine created by the Wisconsin Glacier. The Rockaway Peninsula, the southernmost part of all of Queens, sits between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, featuring 7 miles (11 km) of beaches.[61][62]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, using the 32 °F (0 °C) coldest month (January) isotherm, Queens and the rest of New York City have a humid continental climate (Dfa) bordering humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with partial shielding from the Appalachian Mountains and moderating influences from the Atlantic Ocean. Queens receives precipitation throughout the year, with an average of 44.8 inches (114 cm) per year. In an average year, there will be 44 days with either moderate or heavy rain.[63]\n\n\nAn average winter will have 22 days with some snowfall, of which nine days have at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of snowfall.[63] Summer is typically hot, humid, and wet. An average year will have 17 days with a high temperature of 90 °F (32 °C) or warmer.[63] In an average year, there are 14 days on which the temperature does not go above 32 °F (0 °C) all day.[63] Spring and autumn can vary from chilly to very warm.\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded at LaGuardia Airport was 107 °F (42 °C) on July 3, 1966.[64][63] The highest temperature ever recorded at John F. Kennedy International Airport was 104 °F (40 °C), also on July 3, 1966.[64][65] LaGuardia Airport's record-low temperature was −7 °F (−22 °C) on February 15, 1943, the effect of which was exacerbated by a shortage of heating oil and coal.[63][66] John F. Kennedy International Airport's record-low temperature was −2 °F (−19 °C), on February 8, 1963, and January 21, 1985.[65][67][68] On January 24, 2016, 30.5 inches (77 cm) of snow fell, which is the record in Queens.[69]\n\n\nTornadoes are generally rare; the most recent tornado, an EF0, touched down in College Point on August 3, 2018, causing minor damage.[70] Before that, there was a tornado in Breezy Point on September 8, 2012, which damaged the roofs of some homes,[71] and an EF1 tornado in Flushing on September 26, 2010.[72]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for JFK Airport, New York (1991–2020 normals,[a] extremes 1948–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 71(22)\n | 71(22)\n | 85(29)\n | 90(32)\n | 99(37)\n | 99(37)\n | 104(40)\n | 101(38)\n | 98(37)\n | 95(35)\n | 80(27)\n | 75(24)\n | 104(40)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 57.7(14.3)\n | 58.3(14.6)\n | 67.5(19.7)\n | 77.9(25.5)\n | 85.6(29.8)\n | 92.4(33.6)\n | 95.2(35.1)\n | 91.9(33.3)\n | 87.9(31.1)\n | 79.7(26.5)\n | 68.9(20.5)\n | 60.6(15.9)\n | 96.8(36.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 39.5(4.2)\n | 41.7(5.4)\n | 48.7(9.3)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 78.0(25.6)\n | 83.6(28.7)\n | 82.2(27.9)\n | 75.8(24.3)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 44.5(6.9)\n | 61.6(16.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 32.8(0.4)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 41.1(5.1)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 60.5(15.8)\n | 70.2(21.2)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 75.0(23.9)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 57.2(14.0)\n | 46.8(8.2)\n | 38.3(3.5)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 26.2(−3.2)\n | 27.4(−2.6)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 42.9(6.1)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.4(16.9)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 67.8(19.9)\n | 61.0(16.1)\n | 49.8(9.9)\n | 39.8(4.3)\n | 32.0(0.0)\n | 47.0(8.3)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 10.2(−12.1)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 20.2(−6.6)\n | 32.6(0.3)\n | 42.9(6.1)\n | 52.6(11.4)\n | 62.8(17.1)\n | 60.1(15.6)\n | 50.0(10.0)\n | 37.9(3.3)\n | 26.9(−2.8)\n | 18.6(−7.4)\n | 8.2(−13.2)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −2(−19)\n | −2(−19)\n | 7(−14)\n | 20(−7)\n | 34(1)\n | 45(7)\n | 55(13)\n | 46(8)\n | 40(4)\n | 30(−1)\n | 15(−9)\n | 2(−17)\n | −2(−19)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.23(82)\n | 2.76(70)\n | 3.94(100)\n | 3.55(90)\n | 3.66(93)\n | 3.85(98)\n | 3.86(98)\n | 4.11(104)\n | 3.58(91)\n | 3.72(94)\n | 3.07(78)\n | 3.96(101)\n | 43.29(1,100)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 7.5(19)\n | 8.6(22)\n | 4.3(11)\n | 0.6(1.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.4(1.0)\n | 4.5(11)\n | 25.9(66)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 inch) | 10.7\n | 9.8\n | 10.8\n | 11.4\n | 11.8\n | 10.6\n | 9.4\n | 9.0\n | 8.2\n | 9.4\n | 8.9\n | 11.2\n | 121.2\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 4.6\n | 3.8\n | 2.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.2\n | 2.6\n | 14.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 64.9\n | 64.4\n | 63.4\n | 64.1\n | 69.5\n | 71.5\n | 71.4\n | 71.7\n | 71.9\n | 69.1\n | 67.9\n | 66.3\n | 68.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1961–1990)[73][74][75] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Neighborhoods of New York City\n\nSee also: List of Queens neighborhoods\n\n![](image)A residential street in Jackson Heights\n![](image)Long Island City, a neighborhood in western Queens\n![](image)Forest Hills Gardens\nFour United States Postal Service postal zones serve Queens, based roughly on those serving the towns in existence at the consolidation of the five boroughs into New York City: Long Island City (ZIP codes starting with 111), Jamaica (114), Flushing (113), and Far Rockaway (116). Also, the Floral Park post office (110), based in Nassau County, serves a small part of northeastern Queens. Each of these main post offices has neighborhood stations with individual ZIP codes, and unlike the other boroughs, these station names are often used in addressing letters. These ZIP codes do not always reflect traditional neighborhood names and boundaries; \"East Elmhurst\", for example, was largely coined by the USPS and is not an official community. Most neighborhoods have no solid boundaries. The Forest Hills and Rego Park neighborhoods, for instance, overlap.\n\n\nResidents of Queens often closely identify with their neighborhood rather than with the borough or city. The borough is a patchwork of dozens of unique neighborhoods, each with its own distinct identity:\n\n\n\n1. Flushing, one of the largest neighborhoods in Queens, has a large and growing Asian community. The community consists of Chinese, Koreans, and South Asians. Asians have now expanded eastward along the Northern Boulevard axis through Murray Hill, Whitestone, Bayside, Douglaston–Little Neck, and eventually into adjacent Nassau County.[76][77] These neighborhoods historically contained Italian Americans and Greeks, as well as Latino Americans. The busy intersection of Main Street, Kissena Boulevard, and 41st Avenue defines the center of Downtown Flushing and the Flushing Chinatown (法拉盛華埠), known as the \"Chinese Times Square\" or the \"Chinese Manhattan\".[78][79] The segment of Main Street between Kissena Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, punctuated by the Long Island Rail Road trestle overpass, represents the cultural heart of the Flushing Chinatown. Housing over 25,000 individuals born in China alone, Flushing has become home to one of the largest Chinatowns, representing the largest Chinese population of any U.S. municipality other than New York City in total.[80]\n2. Howard Beach, Whitestone, and Middle Village are home to large Italian American populations.\n3. Ozone Park and South Ozone Park have large Italian, Hispanic, and Guyanese populations.\n4. Rockaway Beach has a large Irish American population.\n5. Astoria, in the northwest, is traditionally home to one of the largest Greek populations outside Greece. It also has large Spanish American and Italian American communities, and is home to a growing population of immigrants from the Middle East, South Asia, the Balkans as well as young professionals from Manhattan. Nearby Long Island City is a major commercial center and the home to Queensbridge, the largest housing project in North America.\n6. Maspeth and Ridgewood are home to many Eastern European immigrants such as Romanian, Polish, Serbian, Albanian, and other Slavic populations. Ridgewood also has a large Hispanic population.\n7. Jackson Heights and Elmhurst make up a conglomeration of Hispanic, Asian, Tibetan, and South Asian communities. Jackson Heights is also known as \"Little Colombia\" thanks to the gastronomical and demographic impact of Colombian people.[81]\n8. Woodside is home to a large Filipino American community and has a \"Little Manila\" as well a large Irish American population. Many Filipino Americans live in Hollis and Queens Village.\n9. Richmond Hill, in the south, is often thought of as \"Little Guyana\" for its large Guyanese community,[82] as well as Punjab Avenue (ਪੰਜਾਬ ਐਵੇਨਿਊ), or Little Punjab, for its high concentration of Punjabi people.\n10. Rego Park, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, and Kew Gardens Hills have traditionally large Jewish populations (historically from Germany and Eastern Europe; though more recent immigrants are from Israel, Iran, and the former Soviet Union). These neighborhoods are also known for large and growing Asian communities, mainly immigrants from China.\n11. Jamaica Estates, Jamaica Hills, Hillcrest, Fresh Meadows, and Hollis Hills are also populated with many people of Jewish background. Many Asian families reside in parts of Fresh Meadows as well.\n12. Jamaica is home to large African American, Caribbean, and Central American populations. There are also middle-class African American and Caribbean neighborhoods such as Saint Albans, Queens Village, Cambria Heights, Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, Laurelton, and Briarwood along east and southeast Queens.\n13. Bellerose and Floral Park, originally home to many Irish Americans, is home to a growing South Asian population, predominantly Indian Americans.\n14. Corona and Corona Heights, once considered the \"Little Italy\" of Queens, was a predominantly Italian community with a strong African American community in the northern portion of Corona and adjacent East Elmhurst. From the 1920s through the 1960s, Corona remained a close-knit neighborhood. Corona today has the highest concentration of Latinos of any Queens neighborhood, with an increasing Chinese American population, located between Elmhurst and Flushing.[83]\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Queens\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Historical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 16,014 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 16,916 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1810 | 19,336 |  | 14.3% |\n| 1820 | 21,519 |  | 11.3% |\n| 1830 | 22,460 |  | 4.4% |\n| 1840 | 30,324 |  | 35.0% |\n| 1850 | 36,833 |  | 21.5% |\n| 1860 | 57,391 |  | 55.8% |\n| 1870 | 73,803 |  | 28.6% |\n| 1880 | 90,574 |  | 22.7% |\n| 1890 | 128,059 |  | 41.4% |\n| 1900 | 152,999 |  | 19.5% |\n| 1910 | 284,041 |  | 85.6% |\n| 1920 | 469,042 |  | 65.1% |\n| 1930 | 1,079,129 |  | 130.1% |\n| 1940 | 1,297,634 |  | 20.2% |\n| 1950 | 1,550,849 |  | 19.5% |\n| 1960 | 1,809,578 |  | 16.7% |\n| 1970 | 1,986,473 |  | 9.8% |\n| 1980 | 1,891,325 |  | −4.8% |\n| 1990 | 1,951,598 |  | 3.2% |\n| 2000 | 2,229,379 |  | 14.2% |\n| 2010 | 2,230,722 |  | 0.1% |\n| 2020 | 2,405,464 |  | 7.8% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[84]1790-1960[85] 1900-1990[85] 1990-2000[86] 2010-2018[7] 2020[2] |\n |\n\n\n\n\n| New York City's five boroughs* v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| Jurisdiction\n | Population\n | Land area\n | Density of population\n | GDP |\n| Borough | County | Census (2020) | square miles | squarekm | people/sq. mile | people/sq. km | billions(2022 US$) 2 |\n| **The Bronx**\n | Bronx\n | 1,472,654\n | 42.2\n | 109.2\n | 34,920\n | 13,482\n | $43.7\n |\n| **Brooklyn**\n | Kings\n | 2,736,074\n | 69.4\n | 179.7\n | 39,438\n | 15,227\n | $107.3\n |\n| **Manhattan**\n | New York\n | 1,694,251\n | 22.7\n | 58.7\n | 74,781\n | 28,872\n | $781.0\n |\n| **Queens**\n | **Queens**\n | **2,405,464** | **108.7** | **281.6** | **22,125** | **8,542** | **$103.3** |\n| **Staten Island**\n | Richmond\n | 495,747\n | 57.5\n | 149.0\n | 8,618\n | 3,327\n | $17.5\n |\n| **City of New York**\n | **8,804,190** | **300.5** | **778.2** | **29,303** | **11,314** | **$1,052.8** |\n| State of New York\n | 20,201,249 | 47,123.6 | 122,049.5 | 429 | 166 | $1,763.5\n |\n| **Sources**:[87][88][89][90] and see individual borough articles.\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Racial composition | 2020[91] | 2010[92] | 1990[93] | 1970[93] | 1950[93] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 25.8% | 39.7% | 57.9% | 85.3% | 96.5%\n |\n| —Non-Hispanic | 22.8% | 27.6% | 48.0% | n/a | n/a\n |\n| Black or African American | 16.8% | 19.1% | 21.7% | 13.0% | 3.3%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 27.8% | 27.5% | 19.5% | 7.7%[94] | n/a\n |\n| Asian | 27.5% | 22.9% | 12.2% | 1.1% | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Elmhurst Chinatown (艾姆赫斯特 唐人街) at the corner of Broadway and Dongan Avenue\n![](image)Astoria, a largely Greek-American neighborhoodAt the 2020 census, 2,405,464 people lived in Queens. In 2018's American Community Survey, the population of Queens was estimated by the United States Census Bureau to have increased to 2,278,906, a rise of 2.2%. Queens' estimated population represented 27.1% of New York City's population of 8,398,748; 29.6% of Long Island's population of 7,701,172; and 11.7% of New York State's population of 19,542,209. The 2019 estimates reported a decline to 2,253,858.[95] In 2018, there were 865,878 housing units, and 777,904 households, 2.97 persons per household, and a median value of $481,300. There was an owner-occupancy rate of 44.5.[95] In the 2010 United States census, Queens recorded a population of 2,230,722. There were 780,117 households enumerated, with an average of 2.82 persons per household. The population density was 20,465.3 inhabitants per square mile (7,901.7 inhabitants/km2). There were 835,127 housing units at an average density of 7,661.7 units per square mile (2,958.2/km2).\n\n\nThe racial makeup of the county in 2010 was 39.7% White, 19.1% Black or African American, 0.7% Native American, 22.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 12.9% from other races, and 4.5% from two or more races. A total of 27.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latin American of any race. The non-Hispanic white population was 27.6%.[92] In 2019, non-Hispanic whites made up an estimated 24.4% of the population, and Blacks or African Americans were 17.3%.[95] The largest minority groups for the borough were Hispanic and Latin Americans (28.2%), and Asians (26.0%).\n\n\nIn Queens, residents consisted of 6.2% under 5, 13.9% 6–18, 64.2% 19–64, and 15.7% over 65. Females made up 51.5% of the population. An estimated 47.5% of residents are foreign-born in 2018. The per capita income was $28,814, and the median household income was $62,008. In 2018, 12.2% of residents lived below the poverty line.\n\n\nThe New York City Department of City Planning was alarmed by the negligible reported increase in population between 2000 and 2010. Areas with high proportions of immigrants and undocumented aliens are traditionally undercounted for a variety of reasons, often based on a mistrust of government officials or an unwillingness to be identified. In many cases, counts of vacant apartment units did not match data from local surveys and reports from property owners.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Little India in Jackson Heights\n![](image)Ridgewood is home to a large Puerto Rican community\nAccording to a 2001 Claritas study, Queens was the most diverse county in the United States among counties of 100,000+ population.[97] A 2014 analysis by *The Atlantic* found Queens County to be the third most racially diverse county-equivalent in the United States—behind Aleutians West Census Area and Aleutians East Borough in Alaska—as well as the most diverse county in New York.[9] Meanwhile, a 2017 study by Axios found that, although numerous smaller counties in the United States had higher rates of diversity, Queens was the United States' most diverse populous county.[10]\n\n\nIn Queens, approximately 48.5% of the population was foreign born as of 2010. Within the foreign born population, 49.5% were born in Latin America, 33.5% in Asia, 14.8% in Europe, 1.8% in Africa, and 0.4% in North America. Roughly 2.1% of the population was born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or abroad to American parents. In addition, 51.2% of the population was born in the United States. Approximately 44.2% of the population over 5 years of age speak English at home; 23.8% speak Spanish at home. Also, 16.8% of the populace speak other Indo-European languages at home. Another 13.5% speak a non-Indo-European Asian language or language of the Pacific Islands at home.[98]\n\n\nAmong the Asian population in 2010, people of Chinese ethnicity made up the largest ethnic group at 10.2% of Queens' population, with about 237,484 people; the other East and Southeast Asian groups are: Koreans (2.9%), Filipinos (1.7%), Japanese (0.3%), Thais (0.2%), Vietnamese (0.2%), and Indonesians and Burmese both make up 0.1% of the population.[99] People of South Asian descent made up 7.8% of Queens' population: Indians (5.3%), Bangladeshi (1.5%), Pakistanis (0.7%), and Nepali (0.2%).[99] In 2019, Chinese Americans remained the largest Asian ethnicity (10.9%) followed by Asian Indians (5.7%).[95] Asian Indians had estimated population of 144,896 in 2014 (6.24% of the 2014 borough population),[100] as well as Pakistani Americans, who numbered at 15,604.[101] Queens has the second largest Sikh population in the nation after California.[102]\n\n\nAmong the Hispanic or Latin American population, Puerto Ricans made up the largest ethnic group at 4.6%, next to Mexicans, who made up 4.2% of the population, and Dominicans at 3.9%. Central Americans made up 2.4% and are mostly Salvadorans. South Americans constitute 9.6% of Queens's population, mainly of Ecuadorian (4.4%) and Colombian descent (4.2%).[99] The 2019 American Community Survey estimated Mexicans and Puerto Ricans were equally the largest groups (4.5% each) in Queens, and Cuban Americans were the third largest single group. Other Hispanic and Latinos collectively made up 18.9% of the population.[95] The Hispanic or Latino population increased by 61% to 597,773 between 1990 and 2006 and now accounts for over 26.5% of the borough's population.\n\n\nQueens has the largest Colombian population in the city, accounting for over 35.6% of the city's total Colombian population, for a total of 145,956 in 2019;[81] it also has the largest Ecuadorian population in the city, accounting for 62.2% of the city's total Ecuadorian population, for a total of 101,339. Queens has the largest Peruvian population in the city, accounting for 69.9% of the city's total Peruvian population, for a total of 30,825.

The Mexican population in Queens has increased 45.7% since 2011 to 71,283, the second-highest in the city, after Brooklyn.[103]\n\n\nQueens is also home to 49.6% of the city's Asian population. Among the five boroughs, Queens has the largest population of Chinese, Indian, Korean, Filipino, Bangladeshi and Pakistani Americans. Queens has the largest Asian American population by county outside the Western United States; according to the 2006 American Community Survey, Queens ranks fifth among US counties with 477,772 (21.18%) Asian Americans, behind Los Angeles County, California, Honolulu County, Hawaii, Santa Clara County, California, and Orange County, California.\n\n\nSome main European ancestries in Queens as of 2000 include: Italian (8.4%), Irish (5.5%), German (3.5%), Polish (2.7%), Russian (2.3%), and Greek (2.0%). Of the European American population, Queens has the third largest Bosnian population in the United States behind only St. Louis and Chicago, numbering more than 15,000.[104] Queens is home to some 50,000 Armenian Americans.[105]\n\n\nThe *Jewish Community Study of New York 2011*, sponsored by the UJA-Federation of New York, found that about 9% of Queens residents were Jews.[106] In 2011, there were about 198,000 Jews in Queens, making it home to about 13% of all people in Jewish households in the eight-county area consisting of the Five Boroughs and Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties.[106] Russian-speaking Jews make up 28% of the Jewish population in Queens, the largest in any of the eight counties.[107]\n\n\nIn Queens, the Black and African American population earns more than non-Hispanic whites on average.[108] Many of these Blacks and African Americans live in quiet, middle-class suburban neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have large black populations whose family income is higher than average. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing (most of the outgoing population has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, and Douglaston–Little Neck have not had a substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods desirable for people who want to reside near Manhattan but in a less urban setting.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the office of the New York State Comptroller in 2000, 138 languages are spoken in the borough.[109] The 2021 American Community Survey by the United States Census Bureau, found that – of those over the age of five residing in Queens – 54.53% spoke a language other than English in the home. The following tables shows the 15 most common non-English languages in Queens, with the most prominent being Spanish, Chinese, and Bengali.\n\n\n\n|      |\n| --- |\n| Language​\n |\n| Ages 5+​\n |\n| %​\n |\n| Source →\n |\n\n\n| 1 |  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English | non-English | Spanish | Chinese | Bengali | Korean | Tagalog | Russian | Haitian | Polish | Italian | Greek | Arabic | Punjabi | Urdu | Hindi | French |\n| 1,000,116 | **1,199,561** | 516,251 | 205,371 | 84,349 | 41,420 | 30,427 | 28,013 | 24,928 | 22,342 | 21,273 | 19,749 | 16,269 | 16,139 | 15,769 | 13,176 | 12,384\n |\n| 45.47% | **54.53%** | 23.47% | 9.34% | 3.83% | 1.88% | 1.38% | 1.27% | 1.13% | 1.02% | 0.97% | 0.9% | 0.74% | 0.73% | 0.72% | 0.6% | 0.56%\n |\n| \"*2021 American Community Survey: LANGUAGE SPOKEN AT HOME\"*\".

Altogether, 49.4% of the population was claimed as members by religious congregations, although members of historically African American denominations were underrepresented due to incomplete information.[110] In 2014, Queens had 738 religious organizations, the thirteenth most out of all U.S. counties.[111]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of New York City, LGBT culture in New York City § Queens, Music of New York City, and List of people from Queens\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n2018 Queens Pride Parade: Caribbean Equality Project at top, and the ensuing Multicultural Festival below\n\nQueens has been the center of the punk rock movement, particularly in New York; Ramones originated out of Forest Hills,[112] it has also been the home of such notable artists as Tony Bennett, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Simon, and Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\n\nQueens Poet Laureates (generally, 3-year appointments):\n\n\n\n* 1997–2001: Stephen Stepanchev (inaugural Poet Laureate)\n* 2001–2004: Hal Sirowitz (born 1949)\n* 2004–2007: Ishle Yi Park\n* 2007–2010: Julio Marzan\n* 2010–2014: Paolo Javier\n* 2015–2019: Maria Lisella[113]\n\n\nQueens has notably fostered African American culture, with establishments such as The Afrikan Poetry Theatre and the Black Spectrum Theater Company catering specifically to African Americans in Queens.[114][115] In the 1940s, Queens was an important center of jazz; such jazz luminaries as Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Ella Fitzgerald took up residence in Queens, seeking refuge from the segregation they found elsewhere in New York.[116] Additionally, many notable hip-hop acts hail from Queens, including Nas, Run-D.M.C., Kool G Rap, A Tribe Called Quest, LL Cool J, MC Shan, Mobb Deep, 50 Cent, Nicki Minaj, Tony Yayo, Tragedy Khadafi, N.O.R.E., Lloyd Banks, Capone, Ja Rule, Heems of Das Racist and Action Bronson.\n\n\nQueens hosts various museums and cultural institutions that serve its diverse communities. They range from the historical (such as the John Bowne House) to the scientific (such as the New York Hall of Science), from conventional art galleries (such as the Noguchi Museum) to unique graffiti exhibits (such as 5 Pointz). Queens's cultural institutions include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n* 5 Pointz\n* Afrikan Poetry Theatre\n* Bowne House\n* Flushing Town Hall\n* King Manor\n* MoMA PS1\n* Museum of the Moving Image\n* Noguchi Museum\n* New York Hall of Science\n* Queens Botanical Garden\n* Queens Museum of Art\n* SculptureCenter\n* Hindu Temple Society of North America\n* Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning\n\nThe travel magazine *Lonely Planet* also named Queens the top destination in the country for 2015 for its cultural and culinary diversity.[117] Stating that Queens is \"quickly becoming its hippest\" but that \"most travelers haven't clued in... yet,\"[118] the *Lonely Planet* stated that \"nowhere is the image of New York as the global melting pot truer than Queens.\"[119]\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\nThe cuisine available in Queens reflects its vast cultural diversity. The cuisine of a particular neighborhood often represents its demographics; for example, Astoria hosts many Greek restaurants, in keeping with its traditionally Greek population.[120] Jackson Heights is known for its prominent Indian cuisine and also many Latin American eateries.[121]\n\n\nThe Queens Night Market in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, operating on Sundays from April to October starting in 2015, contains samples of food from dozens of countries.[122]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of New York City\n\n![](image)JetBlue's corporate headquarters in Queens\nQueens has the second-largest economy of New York City's five boroughs, following Manhattan. In 2004, Queens had 15.2% (440,310) of all private-sector jobs in New York City and 8.8% of private-sector wages. In 2012, private-sector employment increased to 486,160.[123] Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs, with occupations spread relatively evenly across the health care, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and film and television production sectors, such that no single sector is overwhelmingly dominant.[13]\n\n\nThe diversification in Queens' economy is reflected in a large amount of employment in the export-oriented portions of its economy—such as transportation, manufacturing, and business services—that serve customers outside the region. This accounts for more than 27% of all Queens jobs and offers an average salary of $43,727, 14% greater than that of jobs in the locally oriented sector.\n\n\n\n![](image)Long Island City is one of New York City's fastest-growing neighborhoods.[124]\nThe borough's largest employment sector—trade, transportation, and utilities—accounted for nearly 30% of all jobs in 2004; in 2012, its largest employment sector became health care and social services.[123] Queens is home to two of the three major New York City area airports, JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. These airports are among the busiest in the world, leading the airspace above Queens to be the most congested in the country. This airline industry is particularly important to the economy of Queens, providing almost one-quarter of the sector's employment and more than 30% of the sector's wages.\n\n\nEducation and health services were the next largest sector in Queens and comprised almost 24% of the borough's jobs in 2004; in 2012, transportation and warehousing, and retail were the second largest at 12% each.[123] The manufacturing and construction industries in Queens are among the largest of the city and accounted for nearly 17% of the borough's private sector jobs in 2004. Comprising almost 17% of the jobs in Queens is the information, financial activities, and business and professional services sectors in 2004.\n\n\nAs of 2003[update], Queens had almost 40,000 business establishments. Small businesses act as an important part of the borough's economic vitality with two-thirds of all businesses employing between one and four people.\n\n\nSeveral large companies have their headquarters in Queens, including watchmaker Bulova, based in East Elmhurst; internationally renowned piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons in Astoria; Glacéau, the makers of Vitamin Water, headquartered in Whitestone; and JetBlue Airways, an airline based in Long Island City.\n\n\nLong Island City is a major manufacturing and back-office center. Flushing is a major commercial hub for Chinese American and Korean American businesses, while Jamaica is the major civic and transportation hub for the borough.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Sports in New York City\n\n![](image)Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets\n![](image)Arthur Ashe Stadium during the 2014 US Open\nQueens is home of the New York Mets of Major League Baseball.[125] Founded in 1962 as an expansion team, the Mets has won 2 World Series championships and 5 National League pennants. Citi Field is a 41,922-seat stadium opened in April 2009 in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park that is the home ballpark of the Mets.[126] Shea Stadium, the former home of the Mets and the New York Jets of the National Football League, as well as the temporary home of the New York Yankees and the New York Giants Football Team stood where Citi Field's parking lot is now located, operating from 1964 to 2008.[127] Queens is the future home of the new stadium for New York City FC of Major League Soccer, which is expected to be completed in 2027.[128]\n\n\nThe U.S. Open tennis tournament has been played since 1978 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, located just south of Citi Field.[129] With a capacity of 23,771, Arthur Ashe Stadium is the biggest tennis stadium in the world.[130] The U.S. Open was formerly played at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills.[131] South Ozone Park is the home of Aqueduct Racetrack, which is operated by the New York Racing Association, and offers Thoroughbred horse racing from late October/early November through April.[132] (The Belmont Park racetrack and the adjacent UBS Arena (home of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League) sit entirely in Nassau County, just over the City line; however, small sections of the properties of both venues are in Queens, as is the Belmont Park station of the Long Island Rail Road.)\n\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of New York City\n\n\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Queens County, New York[133][134][135]\n| Year\n |

and houses the borough's Supreme Court, Surrogate Court, and County Clerk.[136]\nSince New York City's consolidation in 1898, Queens has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a strong mayor–council system. The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Queens. The Queens Library is governed by a 19-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the Mayor of New York City and the Borough President of Queens.\n\n\nSince 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Queens' Borough President is Donovan Richards, elected in November 2020 as a Democrat. Queens Borough Hall is the seat of government and is located in Kew Gardens.\n\n\nThe Democratic Party holds most public offices. Sixty-three percent of registered Queens voters are Democrats. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development. Controversial political issues in Queens include development, noise, and the cost of housing.\n\n\nEach of the city's five counties has its criminal court system and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. Richard A. Brown, who ran on both the Republican and Democratic Party tickets, was the District Attorney of Queens County from 1991 to 2018. The new DA as of January 2020 is Melinda Katz.[137] Queens has 12 seats on the New York City Council, the second-largest number among the five boroughs. It is divided into 14 community districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for residents.\n\n\nAlthough Queens is heavily Democratic, it is considered a swing county in New York politics. Republican political candidates who do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections. Republicans such as former Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg won majorities in Queens. Republican State Senator Serphin Maltese represented a district in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo, Jr. In 2002, Queens voted against incumbent Republican Governor of New York George Pataki in favor of his Democratic opponent, Carl McCall by a slim margin.[138]\n\n\nOn the national level, Queens has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1972, when Queens voters chose Richard Nixon over George McGovern. Since the 1996 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidates have received over 70% of the popular vote in Queens.[139] Since the election of Donald Trump, Queens has become known in the United States for its surge in progressive politics and grassroots campaigning.[140]\n\n\n\n### Federal Representation[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, four Democrats and one Republican represent Queens in the United States House of Representatives.[141]\n\n\n\n* George Santos (first elected in 2022) represents New York's 3rd congressional district, which covers the northeast Queens neighborhoods of Little Neck, Whitestone, Glen Oaks, Queens Village and Floral Park. The district also covers the North Shore of Nassau County.[141]\n* Gregory Meeks (first elected in 1998) represents New York's 5th congressional district, which covers the entire Rockaway Peninsula as well as the southeast Queens neighborhoods of Broad Channel, Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, Laurelton, Rosedale, Saint Albans, Springfield Gardens, and South Ozone Park. The district also includes John F. Kennedy International Airport.[141]\n* Grace Meng (first elected in 2012) represents New York's 6th congressional district, which includes the central and eastern Queens neighborhoods of Auburndale, Bayside, Elmhurst, Flushing, Forest Hills, Glendale, Kew Gardens, Maspeth, Middle Village, Murray Hill, and Rego Park.[141]\n* Nydia Velázquez (first elected in 1992) represents New York's 7th congressional district, which includes the Queens neighborhoods of Maspeth, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, Sunnyside and Long Island City. The district also covers central and western Brooklyn.[141]\n* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (first elected in 2018) represents New York's 14th congressional district, which includes the northwest Queens neighborhoods of Astoria, College Point, Corona, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Elmhurst. The district also covers the East Bronx.[141]\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Education in New York City and List of high schools in New York City § Queens\n\n### Elementary and secondary education[edit]\n\n\nElementary and secondary school education in Queens is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions. Non-charter public schools in the borough are managed by the New York City Department of Education,[142] the largest public school system in the United States. Most private schools are affiliated with or identify themselves with the Roman Catholic or Jewish religious communities. Townsend Harris High School is a Queens public magnet high school for the humanities consistently ranked as among the top 100 high schools in the United States. One of the nine Specialized High Schools in New York City is located in Queens. Located in the York College, City University of New York Campus in Jamaica, the Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, which emphasizes both science and mathematics, ranks as one of the best high schools in both the state and the country. It is one of the smallest Specialized High Schools that requires an entrance exam, the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. The school has a student body of around 400 students.\n\n\n\n### Postsecondary institutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens\n![](image)Queens College is part of the City University of New York.\n* LaGuardia Community College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY), is known as \"The World's Community College\" for its diverse international student body representing more than 150 countries and speaking over 100 languages. The college has been named a National Institution of Excellence by the Policy Center on the First Year of College. In a 2003 benchmark survey, in the Large Community College category (8,000–14,999 students), LaGuardia was one of three community colleges ranked number one, nationally.[143] The college hosts the LaGuardia and Wagner Archives.\n* Queens College is one of the elite colleges in the CUNY system. Established in 1937 to offer a strong liberal arts education to the residents of the borough, Queens College has over 16,000 students including more than 12,000 undergraduates and over 4,000 graduate students. Students from 120 countries speaking 66 different languages are enrolled at the school, which is located in Flushing. Queens College is also the host of CUNY's law school. The Queens College Campus is also the home of Townsend Harris High School and the Queens College School for Math, Science, and Technology (PS/IS 499).\n* Queensborough Community College, originally part of the State University of New York, is in Bayside and is now part of CUNY. It prepares students to attend senior colleges mainly in the CUNY system.\n* St. John's University is a private, coeducational Roman Catholic university founded in 1870 by the Vincentian Fathers. With over 19,000 students, St. John's is known for its pharmacy, business and law programs as well as its men's basketball and soccer teams.\n* Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology is a private, cutting edge, degree-granting institution located across the Grand Central Parkway from LaGuardia Airport. Its presence underscores the importance of aviation to the Queens economy.\n* York College is one of CUNY's leading general-purpose liberal arts colleges, granting bachelor's degrees in more than 40 fields, as well as a combined BS/MS degree in Occupational Therapy. Noted for its Health Sciences Programs York College is also home to the Northeast Regional Office of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n### Queens Public Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A branch of the Queens Public Library in Flushing\nThe Queens Public Library is the public library system for the borough and one of three library systems serving New York City. Dating back to the foundation of the first Queens library in Flushing in 1858, the Queens Public Library is one of the largest public library systems in the United States. Separate from the New York Public Library, it is composed of 63 branches throughout the borough. In the fiscal year 2001, the Library achieved a circulation of 16.8 million. The Library has maintained the highest circulation of any city library in the country since 1985 and the highest circulation of any library in the nation since 1987. The Library maintains collections in many languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Haitian Creole, Polish, and six Indic languages, as well as smaller collections in 19 other languages.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transportation in New York City\n\nAccording to 2011–2015 ACS microdata, 38% of Queens households did not own a car; the citywide rate is 55%.[144]\n\n\n\n### Vehicles for hire[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2019, the city had about 80,000 for-hire vehicles, of which, two-thirds were ride-hail – Uber, Lyft, Via, and Juno.[145] Until the COVID-19 pandemic, the ride-hail car offered a ride-share option. There are about 13,500 traditional taxis (yellow cabs with medallions) in the city, 7,676 boro taxis, 38,791 black cars, 21,932 livery cars, 288 commuter vans, and 2,206 paratransit vehicles.\n\n\n\n### Roundtrip car sharing[edit]\n\n\nZipcar, and others, entered New York City market in 2002 offering roundtrip car sharing from private locations, mostly from parking garages. In 2018, the city partnered with the roundtrip car share companies, led by Zipcar, to launch the nation's larges on-street car-sharing program with the greatest take-up in The Bronx and in Queens – Jackson Heights, Jamaica, and Far Rockaway.[146][147][148][149][150] In 2020, during beginning throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, Enterprise CarShare suspended service in New York City. Among the traditional car rental locations in Queens, both international airports harbor larger fleets, conveniently close to Queens residents.\n\n\n\n### Micromobility[edit]\n\n\nCiti Bike – a docked-bike and e-bike sharing company had, as of July 2019, 169,000 annual subscribers. In 2021, the Department of Transportation and Citi Bike announced that, as part of its Phase 3 expansion, it was doubling its service area to 70 square miles and tripling the number of bikes to 40,000. The expansion includes 52 new docking stations in Astoria, as well as new stations in Sunnyside and Woodside.[151]\n\n\nNon-docked e-moped service was launched in the city by Revel in 2019. Companies such as Bird, Lime, VeoRide introduced non-docked e-scooter-sharing in 2021.[152]\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![Five jumbo airplanes wait in a line on a runway next to a small body of water. Behind them in the distance is the airport and control tower.](image)John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, the busiest international air passenger gateway to the United States\n![](image)A multibillion-dollar reconstruction of LaGuardia Airport was announced in July 2015.[153]\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Airline Revenue Passengersat Queens Airports**\n**2019 → pre-COVID-19 pandemic**\n |\n| \n\n---\n\n | Domestic\n\n\n---\n\n | International\n\n\n---\n\n | Rank\\*\n\n\n---\n\n | Total\n\n\n---\n\n |\n|   JFK |    28,233,791\n |    34,317,281\n | **❶** |    62,551,072\n |\n|   LGA\n\n\n---\n\n | 28,875,041\n\n\n---\n\n | 2,209,853\n\n\n---\n\n | \n\n---\n\n | 31,084,894\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Total\n | 57,108,832\n | 36,527,134\n |  | 93,635,966\n |\n|  |\n| **2020 → mid-COVID-19 pandemic**\n\n\n---\n\n |\n|   JFK |    8,267,666\n |    8,362,976\n | **❶** |    16,630,642\n |\n|   LGA\n\n\n---\n\n | 7,853,368\n\n\n---\n\n | 391,824\n\n\n---\n\n | \n\n---\n\n | 8,245,192\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Total\n | 16,121,034\n | 8,754,800\n |  | 24,875,834\n |\n| \\*National rank for international passengers\n     (enplanements + deplanements)[154][155] |\n\nQueens has crucial importance in international and interstate air traffic, with two of the New York metropolitan area's three major airports located there.\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, served 62.6 million passengers (enplanements + deplanements) – 34.3 million of which were international, ranking it the busiest airport in the United States by international passenger traffic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States imposed travel restrictions, first, in January 2020, on travelers from China and, in the following months, on travelers from other countries. 2020 annual passenger traffic at JFK dropped to 16.6 million (−73.4%) – 8.4 million (−73.4%) of which were international, still ranking it the busiest airport in the United States by international passenger traffic.[154][155]\n\n\nJFK is owned by the City of New York and managed, since 1947, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The airport's runways and six terminals cover an area of 4,930 acres (2,000 ha) on Jamaica Bay in southeastern Queens.[156] The airport's original official name was New York International Airport, although it was commonly known as Idlewild, with the name changed to Kennedy in December 1963 to honor the assassination of John F. Kennedy, November 22, 1963.[157]\n\n\nLaGuardia Airport is located in East Elmhurst, in northern Queens, on Flushing Bay. Originally opened in 1939, the airport's two runways and four terminals cover 680 acres (280 ha), serving 28.4 million passengers in 2015.[158] In 2014, citing outdated conditions in the airport's terminals, Vice President Joe Biden compared LaGuardia Airport to a \"third world country\".[159] In 2015, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began a $4 billion project to renovate LaGuardia Airport's terminals and entryways. The project is expected to be complete by 2021.[153]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Public transportation in New York City\n\nMain article: List of New York City Subway stations in Queens\n\nMain article: List of bus routes in Queens\n\nMain article: New York City Subway\n\nMain article: MTA Regional Bus Operations\n\nMain article: Long Island Rail Road\n\nMain article: Brooklyn–Queens Connector\n\n![](image)46th Street – Bliss Street subway station\n![](image)Flushing – Main Street LIRR station\n#### Subways[edit]\n\n\nThe MTA, New York City's 24-hour subway system, has 472 stations, more than any other metro system in the world – 81 of those stations on seven main lines are in Queens. The subway system has almost twice as many miles of track as any other North American system – (i) 665 mi (1,070 km) revenue length (the opposite of \"revenue\" track would be non-revenue track or dead mileage), (ii) 850 mi (1,368 km) total length, and (iii) 248 mi (399 km) route length. Queens has 42 mi (68 km) miles of route length – 15 mi (24 km) underground, 20 mi (32 km) elevated, 7 mi (11 km) other.[160] The A train – from 207th Street in Manhattan to Far Rockaway in Queens – is the longest line, more than 31 miles.[160] The subway system transports triple the number of people than the next five largest American systems – Chicago, Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia combined.\n\n\nThe A, G, J/Z, and M routes connect Queens to Brooklyn without going through Manhattan first. The F, M, N, and R trains connect Queens and Brooklyn via Manhattan, while the E, W, and 7/<7> trains connect Queens to Manhattan only. The L train briefly enters Queens at Halsey Street, connecting Queens to either Brooklyn or both Brooklyn and Manhattan, depending on the direction. Trains on the M service go through Queens twice in the same trip; both of its full-length terminals, in Middle Village and Forest Hills, are in Queens.[161] In addition, the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which operates strictly in the neighborhood of Rockaway Park, provides connections within the borough of Queens.\n\n\n\n#### Long Island Rail Road[edit]\n\n\nThe LIRR, also part of the MTA, operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays – carrying an average of 301,000 customers a day (80 million a year, adjusting downward for weekends) on about 735 scheduled trains.[162] It is the busiest commuter rail hub in the United States. Most of its branches originate or terminate at Penn Station. All but one of its branches (the Port Washington Branch) pass through Jamaica. The New York City area served by the LIRR is called the City Terminal Zone. Within that zone, Queens has stations in Long Island City, Hunterspoint Avenue (in Long Island City), Bayside, Forest Hills, Flushing, Woodside, and Kew Gardens – 22 Queens stations, in all. There are also several stations where LIRR passengers can transfer to the subway.\n\n\nSunnyside Yard is used to store Amtrak intercity and NJ Transit commuter trains from Penn Station in Manhattan. The US$11.1 billion East Side Access project, which will bring LIRR trains to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, is under construction and is scheduled to open in 2022; this project will create a new train tunnel beneath the East River, connecting Long Island City in Queens with the East Side of Manhattan.[163][164]\n\n\n\n#### JFK AirTrain[edit]\n\n\nThe elevated AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road along the Van Wyck Expressway;[165] a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems.[166][167] Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport itself in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities, and this project would accommodate the new AirTrain connection.[153]\n\n\n\n#### MTA buses[edit]\n\n\n2019 bus ridership, citywide, on the MTA system, was 2.2 million per average weekday – about 678 million for the year. In Queens, the Q58 and Q44 Select Bus Service were the seventh and tenth, respectively, citywide, busiest local lines in 2019.[168] In addition to regular bus lines serving LaGuardia Airport, the MTA offers two Select Bus Services, regular fare, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The M60 – terminals A, B, C, D – to and from Manhattan via Grand Central Parkway and the Triborough Bridge – in Harlem, along 125th Street (with a stop at the 125th Street Metro-North station), ending in Morningside Heights on the Upper West Side, a few blocks south of Columbia University. The Q70 – terminals B, C, D – through Queens, ending in Woodside at 61st Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Overall, about 100 local bus routes operate within Queens, and another 20 express routes shuttle commuters between Queens and Manhattan, under the MTA New York City Bus and MTA Bus brands.[169]\n\n\n\n#### Proposed streetcar[edit]\n\n\nA streetcar line connecting Queens with Brooklyn was proposed by the city in February 2016.[170][171] The planned timeline calls for service to begin around 2024.[172]\n\n\n\n#### Water transit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: East 34th Street Ferry Landing\n\n![](image)Newtown Creek with the Midtown Manhattan skyline in the background\nNew York Water Taxi operates service across the East River from Hunters Point in Long Island City to Manhattan at 34th Street and south to Pier 11 at Wall Street. In 2007, limited weekday service was begun between Breezy Point, the westernmost point in the Rockaways, to Pier 11 via the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Summertime weekend service provides service from Lower Manhattan and southwest Brooklyn to the peninsula's Gateway beaches.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012, ferry operator SeaStreak began running a city-subsidized ferry service between a makeshift ferry slip at Beach 108th Street and Beach Channel Drive in Rockaway Park and piers in Manhattan and Brooklyn.[173] The service was extended multiple times.[174] finally ending on October 31, 2014.[175]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government would begin a citywide ferry service called NYC Ferry to extend ferry transportation to communities in the city that have been traditionally underserved by public transit.[176][177] The ferry opened in May 2017,[178][179] with the Queens neighborhoods of Rockaway and Astoria served by their eponymous routes. A third route, the East River Ferry, serves Hunter's Point South.[180]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\n#### Highways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Air Train JFK path above the Van Wyck Expressway\nQueens is traversed by three trunk east–west highways. The Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495) runs from the Queens Midtown Tunnel on the west through the borough to Nassau County on the east. The Grand Central Parkway, whose western terminus is the Triborough Bridge, extends east to the Queens/Nassau border, where the roadway continues as the Northern State Parkway. The Belt Parkway begins at the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, and extends east into Queens, past Aqueduct Racetrack and JFK Airport. On its eastern end at the Queens/Nassau border, it splits into the Southern State Parkway which continues east, and the Cross Island Parkway which turns north.[181]\n\n\nThere are also several major north–south highways in Queens, including the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (Interstate 278), the Van Wyck Expressway (Interstate 678), the Clearview Expressway (Interstate 295), and the Cross Island Parkway.[181]\n\n\nQueens has six state highways that run west–east largely on surface roads. From north to south, they are New York State Route 25A (Northern Boulevard), New York State Route 25B (Hillside Avenue), New York State Route 25 (Queens Boulevard, Hillside Avenue, and Braddock Avenue), New York State Route 24 (Hempstead Avenue), and New York State Route 27 (Conduit Avenue). The only state highway that primarily uses an expressway is New York State Route 878, which uses the Nassau Expressway in southern Queens.[181]\n\n\n\n#### Streets[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross-street signs for a single-named boulevard and a co-named avenue in Queens\nThe streets of Queens are laid out in a semi-grid system, with a numerical system of street names (similar to Manhattan and the Bronx). Nearly all roadways oriented north–south are \"Streets\", while east–west roadways are \"Avenues\", beginning with the number 1 in the west for Streets and the north for Avenues. In some parts of the borough, several consecutive streets may share numbers (for instance, 72nd Street followed by 72nd Place and 72nd Lane, or 52nd Avenue followed by 52nd Road, 52nd Drive, and 52nd Court), often confusing non-residents.[182] Also, incongruous alignments of street grids, unusual street paths due to geography, or other circumstances often lead to the skipping of numbers (for instance, on Ditmars Boulevard, 70th Street is followed by Hazen Street which is followed by 49th Street). Numbered roads tend to be residential, although numbered commercial streets are not rare. A fair number of streets that were country roads in the 18th and 19th centuries (especially major thoroughfares such as Northern Boulevard, Queens Boulevard, Hillside Avenue, and Jamaica Avenue) carry names rather than numbers, typically though not uniformly called \"Boulevards\" or \"Parkways\".\n\n\nQueens house numbering was designed to provide convenience in locating the address itself; the first half of a number in a Queens address refers to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or lot number from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th Street and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This pattern does not stop when a street is named, assuming that there is an existing numbered cross-street. For example, Queens College is situated at 65–30 Kissena Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance is 65th Avenue.[182]\n\n\nMany of the village street grids of Queens had only worded names, some were numbered according to local numbering schemes, and some had a mix of words and numbers. In the early 1920s, a \"Philadelphia Plan\" was instituted to overlay one numbered system upon the whole borough. The Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens, worked out the details. Subway stations were only partly renamed, and some, including those along the IRT Flushing Line (7 and <7>​ trains), now share dual names after the original street names.[183] In 2012, some numbered streets in the Douglaston Hill Historic District were renamed to their original names, with 43rd Avenue becoming Pine Street.[184]\n\n\nThe Rockaway Peninsula does not follow the same system as the rest of the borough and has its own numbering system. Streets are numbered in ascending order heading west from near the Nassau County border, and are prefixed with the word \"Beach.\" Streets at the easternmost end, however, are nearly all named. Bayswater, which is on Jamaica Bay, has its numbered streets prefixed with the word \"Bay\" rather than \"Beach\". Another deviation from the norm is Broad Channel; it maintains the north–south numbering progression but uses only the suffix \"Road\", as well as the prefixes \"West\" and \"East\", depending on location relative to Cross Bay Boulevard, the neighborhood's major through street. Broad Channel's streets were a continuation of the mainland Queens grid in the 1950s; formerly the highest-numbered avenue in Queens was 208th Avenue rather than today's 165th Avenue in Howard Beach & Hamilton Beach. The other exception is the neighborhood of Ridgewood, which for the most part shares a grid and house numbering system with the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. The grid runs east–west from the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch right-of-way to Flushing Avenue; and north–south from Forest Avenue in Ridgewood to Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn before adjusting to meet up with the Bedford-Stuyvesant grid at Broadway. All streets on the grid have names.\n\n\n\n#### Bridges and tunnels[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of bridges and tunnels in New York City\n\n![](image)The Triborough Bridge connects Queens with Manhattan and The Bronx.\nQueens is connected to the Bronx by the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Triborough Bridge (also known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), and the Hell Gate Bridge. Queens is connected to Manhattan Island by the Triborough Bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, as well as to Roosevelt Island by the Roosevelt Island Bridge.\n\n\nWhile most of the Queens/Brooklyn border is on land, the Kosciuszko Bridge crosses the Newtown Creek connecting Maspeth to Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The Pulaski Bridge connects McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint to 11th Street, Jackson Avenue, and Hunters Point Avenue in Long Island City. The J. J. Byrne Memorial Bridge (a.k.a. Greenpoint Avenue Bridge) connects the sections of Greenpoint Avenue in Greenpoint and Long Island City. A lesser bridge connects Grand Avenue in Queens to Grand Street in Brooklyn.\n\n\nThe Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, built in 1939, traverses Jamaica Bay to connect the Rockaway Peninsula to Broad Channel and the rest of Queens.[185] Constructed in 1937, the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge links Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn's longest thoroughfare, with Jacob Riis Park and the western end of the Peninsula.[186] Both crossings were built and continue to be operated by what is now known as MTA Bridges and Tunnels.

Since then, it's steadily attracted more and more attendees and, last year averaged 10,000 people a night. Those thousands of New Yorkers weren't just hungry for new food, but for new points-of-view. 'When I first started, it was all about how can we attract people with an event that's as affordable and diverse as possible,' says Night Market founder John Wang. 'We've now been able to represent over 85 countries, and I'm constantly hearing examples of people branching out and trying things they've never heard of before.\"\n123. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** DiNapoli, Thomas Peter II; Bleiwas, Kenneth B., Deputy Comptroller (December 2013). \"An Economic Snapshot of Queens\" (PDF).
