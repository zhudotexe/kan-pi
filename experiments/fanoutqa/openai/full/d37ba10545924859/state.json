The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division. Since 2004, the team's home stadium has been Citizens Bank Park, located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7][8][9][10]\n\n\nThe Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008), eight National League pennants (the first of which came in 1915), and made 15 playoff appearances. As of November 6, 2022, the team has played 21,209 games, winning 10,022 games and losing 11,187.[11]\n\n\nSince the first modern World Series was played in 1903, the Phillies have played 120 consecutive seasons and 140 seasons since the team's 1883 establishment. The Phillies were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to win a World Series, with their first championship coming in 1980. Since the start of the Divisional Era in 1969, however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB's most successful teams, winning 11 division titles (including five consecutive such titles from 2007 to 2011), eight National League pennants, and two World Series championships. \n\n\nThe franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts, in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, beginning with Recreation Park (1883\u20131886) and continuing at Baker Bowl (1887\u20131938); Shibe Park (which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938\u20131970); Veterans Stadium (1971\u20132003), and now Citizens Bank Park (2004\u2013present).\n\n\nBecause of, and in spite of, their longevity and rabid fan base, the Phillies are a team historically associated with futility. They were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses; the team holds the world record for most ever losses by a single team in all of professional sports.[12] Yet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to have won over 10,000 games in their history. Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise's greatest player of all time.[13] Over the team's history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been awarded entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies' Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown. The Double-A affiliate is the Reading Fightin Phils, who play in Reading. The Class-A affiliates are the Jersey Shore BlueClaws, who play in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, and the Clearwater Threshers, who play at BayCare Ballpark.\n\n\nThe team's spring training facilities are in Clearwater, Florida.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Philadelphia Phillies\n\n### Philadelphia Quakers (1883\u20131889)[edit]\n\n\n![Team photograph of the 1888 Philadelphia Quakers](image)The 1888 Philadelphia Quakers team\nIn 1883, sporting goods manufacturer Al Reach (a pioneering professional baseball player) and attorney John Rogers won an expansion National League franchise for Philadelphia, one of what is now known as the \"Classic Eight\" of the National League. They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester baseball team, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the \"Phillies\" from the start, and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which stands as the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester[14] ended up with the 1883 Quakers.[15]\n\n\nIn 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as a manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes.[16]\n\n\nIn 1887, the team began to play at the newly constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds, later renamed National League Park. The stadium would become known as Baker Bowl in 1923. Despite a general improvement from their dismal beginnings, they never seriously contended for the title.\n\n\n\n### Becoming the Phillies (1890\u20131917)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1915 World Series and City Series (Philadelphia)\n\n![Photograph of Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, resting a bat on his right shoulder, taken from his left side](image)Grover Cleveland Alexander, Phillies pitcher from 1911 to 1917 and again in the 1930 season\nThe nickname \"Phillies\" first appeared in *The Philadelphia Inquirer* on April 3, 1883, in the paper's coverage of an exhibition game by the new National League club and was the team's accepted nickname from the start. This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.[17]\n\n\nThe franchise's standout players in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major-league record (since tied by several others) with four home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899.[16]\n\n\nWith the birth of the more lucrative American League (AL) in 1901, the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. While their former teammates would thrive (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in 1902\u2014the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. \n\n\nTo add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits.[16] In 1904, the team finished with a record of 52\u2013100, making them the first team in franchise history to have lost 100 games.\n\n\nThe Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set the 20th century single-season record for home runs with 24. They finished the season with a record of 90\u201362, seven games ahead of the Boston Braves. The Phillies went up against the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, opening the series at home with a victory. The Phillies struggled against a strong Red Sox pitching lineup and surrendered the next four games, losing the series four games to one. \n\n\nThe team continued to dominate the National League in 1916 but fell short of capturing a second consecutive pennant. The team finished two and a half games out of first place with a record of 91\u201362. Alexander won his second consecutive triple crown and posted 16 shutouts, tying the single-season major league record.\n\n\nIn 1917, Alexander had been traded to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Prendegrast and catcher Pickles Dillhoefer, when owner William Baker refused to increase his salary. Baker was known for running the Phillies very cheaply; for instance, during much of his tenure, there was only one scout in the entire organization. The Phillies finished the 1917 season in second place with a record of 87\u201365, ten games behind the New York Giants.\n\n\n\n### Three decades of struggle (1918\u20131948)[edit]\n\n\n![Street view photograph of the entrance to Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1938 to 1970](image)Shibe Park, renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953, was the Phillies' home field from 1938 to 1970.\nThe effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, 13 games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record, which came in 1932. The team finished higher than sixth only twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished eighth (last place) a total of 17 times and seventh seven times, with 12 seasons in which they lost at least 100 games. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. The team's primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O'Doul, and Chuck Klein, who won the Triple Crown in 1933.\n\n\nBaker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years earlier, Mallen had married a leather goods and shoe dealer, Gerald Nugent. With the support of Baker's widow, Nugent became team president. Baker's widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in complete control.[16] Unlike Baker, Nugent badly wanted to build a winning team, however, he did not have the financial means to do so. He was forced to trade what little talent the team had to make ends meet, and often had to use some creative financial methods to field a team at all.[18]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Baker Bowl proved to be a fertile hitting ground for Phillies opponents as well, and in 1930, the team surrendered 1199 runs, a major-league record still standing today. Once considered one of the finest parks in baseball, it was not well maintained from the 1910s onward. For instance, until 1925, the Phillies used a flock of sheep to trim the grass. Fans were often showered with rust whenever one of Klein's home runs hit girders. The entire right field grandstand collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A's Shibe Park (five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927.\nThe Phillies tried to move to Shibe Park on a permanent basis as tenants of the A's. However, Baker Bowl's owner, Charles W. Murphy, at first refused to let the Phillies out of their lease. He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened to condemn the dilapidated park. Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 3,000 a game.\n\n\nThe lowest point came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a 43\u2013111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. A year later, they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring training. Nugent realized he did not have enough money to operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale.\n\n\nAfter lumber baron William D. Cox purchased the team with a group of investors for $190,000 and a $50,000 note on March 15, 1943,[19] the Phillies rose out of last place for the first time in five years. As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. Eventually, Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies, and he was banned from baseball by baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis on Nov. 23, 1943. The new owner, Bob Carpenter Sr., scion of the Delaware-based duPont family, bought the team with his son for an estimated $400,000 that same day \u2013 November 23, 1943.[19] The Carpenters tried to polish the team's image and way of doing business. Carpenter Sr. named his son, Bob Carpenter, Jr., team president. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team's nickname.\n\n\n\n#### Philadelphia Blue Jays[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 1944 season, the team held a fan contest soliciting a new team nickname. Management chose \"Blue Jays\", the fan submission of Elizabeth Crooks, who received a $100 war bond as compensation.[20] The Phillies would later claim in the 2000s that the Blue Jays moniker was never official,[21] however news reports in 1944 note that Phillies management said that the Blue Jays name was as an official \"additional nickname\", meaning that the team had two official nicknames simultaneously, the Phillies and the Blue Jays.[20][22][23]\n\n\nThe Phillies' official adoption of Blue Jays as a second official nickname led to a dispute with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, whose nickname is and was Blue Jays. Wilson Shaffer, the school's athletic director, criticized the Philadelphia team for adopting his university's moniker, and said that Philadelphia should use the blue jay's scientific name instead and be known as the Philadelphia Cyanocitta Cristata. Similarly, the university's student council, citing the Philadelphia team's long track record of failure, passed a resolution demanding \"suitable satisfaction\" for what they perceived as theft and sullying of the Blue Jays name. Carpenter, Jr., responded by criticizing Johns Hopkins' baseball record and promised to make the students proud of the Blue Jays name by having his Philadelphia baseball team win many games.[22]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia team added three minor league clubs before the start of the 1946 season and named them all Blue Jays: the Class C Salina Blue Jays, Class C Schenectady Blue Jays and Class D Green Bay Blue Jays. \n\n\nHowever, the new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular, and although the team in the 2000s claimed that it was quietly dropped by 1949,[21] news reports at the time indicate that the nickname, which \"never caught on anyway\", was not officially dropped by the team until January 1950.[23]\n\n\nCoincidentally, the Phillies would play a team called the Blue Jays (who wasn't based in Philadelphia but in Toronto) in the 1993 World Series with the defending world champion Blue Jays winning in six games.\n\n\n(The Blue Jays moniker would be used by Toronto's MLB club when it started play in 1977.[21])\n\n\n\n### Fightin\u2019 Phils (1949\u20131970)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1950 World Series, Jim Bunning's perfect game, and Whiz Kids (baseball)\n\n![A sketch portrait of Robin Roberts the Phillies' pitcher from 1948 to 1961](image)Robin Roberts, Phillies' pitcher from 1948 to 1961\n![](image)Richie Ashburn, Phillies' center fielder from 1948 to 1959\n![Team photograph of the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies](image)The 1964 Philadelphia Phillies team\nLike Cox, Bob Carpenter Jr. was not afraid to spend the money it took to build a contender. He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system, and the Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia had been an \"A's town\" for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most years since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans.\n\n\nThings started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81\u201373 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter Sr., who had died in June and left Bob Jr. in full control of the team.\n\n\nThe 1950 Phillies led the National League standings for most of the season and were dubbed the \"Whiz Kids\". In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when Dick Sisler\u2019s dramatic tenth inning home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team.\n\n\nIn contrast, the Philadelphia Athletics finished last in 1950, and longtime manager Connie Mack retired. The team struggled for four more years with only one winning season before abandoning Philadelphia under the Johnson brothers, who bought out Mack. They began to play in Kansas City in 1955.[24] As part of the deal selling that team to the Johnson brothers, the Phillies bought Shibe Park, where both teams had played since 1938.[25] Many thought that the \"Whiz Kids\", with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come.[26][27] However, the team finished with a 73\u201381 record in 1951 and finished nine and a half games out of first place in 1952, with an 87\u201367 record. The Phillies managed to end up in third place in 1953 with an 83\u201371 record, however, they would fail to break .500 from 1954 to 1957.\n\n\nIt became apparent that the flash and determination of the Whiz Kids would not return when the team finished last place in the National League from 1958 to 1961. Manager Eddie Sawyer abruptly quit the team after the season opener in 1960, and was replaced by Gene Mauch.\n\n\nThe team's competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. Things started to turn around for the team in 1962, when the team finished above .500 for the first time in five years. Gene Mauch was named National League Manager of the Year that season and won it again in 1964. The team improved in 1963, when the team finished the season with an 87\u201375 record. There was confidence that the team would soon become contenders for a return to the World Series. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Dick Allen. The team was 90\u201360 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. However, the Phillies lost 10 games in a row and finished one game out of first, losing the pennant to the St. Louis Cardinals. The \"Phold of '64\" is frequently mentioned as the worst collapse in sports history.[28]\n\n\nOne highlight of the 1964 season occurred on Father's Day, when Jim Bunning pitched a perfect game against the New York Mets, the first in Phillies' history.[29]\n\n\nFor the rest of the decade, the team finished no higher than fourth place in the NL standings which came during the 1966 season. In the 1969 season, the Phillies finished fifth in the newly created NL East Division, with a record of 63\u201399.\n\n\nBy the late 1950s, Carpenter decided the Phillies needed a new home. He never wanted to buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was no way he could make money playing there. He sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles' owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a $1\u00a0million loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. The stadium was deteriorating and there was inadequate parking. Attendance began to drop by 1967 and the team started to plan for a new stadium. \n\n\nThe Phillies remained at Connie Mack Stadium until 1970. In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2\u20131. When the game was finished several fans in attendance began to remove items from the ballpark, such as chairs, outfield panels and baseball equipment from the dugouts.\n\n\n\n### Glory days (1971\u20131984)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1980 World Series, 1983 World Series, and Hot Pants Patrol\n\n![Photograph of Veterans Stadium the Phillies' home from 1971 to 2003](image)Veterans Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1971 to 2003\n![Portrait of Phillies' third baseman Mike Schmidt looking at the camera and holding a bat across his chest](image)Mike Schmidt, Phillies' third baseman from 1972 to 1989 and a 1995 Hall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Steve Carlton, Phillies' pitcher from 1972 to 1986 and a 1994 Hall of Fame inductee\nThe Phillies opened the new Veterans Stadium in 1971. The team wore new maroon uniforms to accentuate the change. The stadium was built in South Philadelphia, making it the first time the team was not located in North Philadelphia. The new stadium, along with nearby John F. Kennedy Stadium and the Spectrum, established the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. \n\n\nPitcher Rick Wise hurled a no-hitter and in the same game hit two home runs against the Cincinnati Reds in 1971. That same season, Harry Kalas joined the Phillies broadcasting team. \n\n\nIn 1972, the Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired Steve Carlton won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins) and was awarded his first NL Cy Young Award and won it again in 1977. Bob Carpenter Jr. retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. \n\n\nThe Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With players such as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, catcher Bob Boone, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976\u201378). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them over the top.\n\n\n\n#### 1980 World Series champions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1980 World Series\n\nThe Phillies won the National League East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they had to defeat the Houston Astros. In a memorable NLCS, with four of the five games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2\u20131 but battled back to squeeze past the Astros on a 10th-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first NL pennant in 30 years.[30] The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 3\u20131 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia.\n\n\nFacing the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies won their first World Series championship ever in six games thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1980, also won the World Series Most Valuable Player award on the strength of his 8-for-21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. This final game was also significant because it remains \"the most-watched game in World Series history\" with a television audience of 54.9\u00a0million viewers.[31] Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the Major Leagues from 1903 to 1960 to win a World Series.[32] Carlton captured his third NL Cy Young Award with a record of 24\u20139.\n\n\nAfter their series win, Ruly Carpenter, who had been given control of the team in 1972 when his father stepped down as team president, sold the team for $32.5\u00a0million in 1981 to a group that was headed by longtime Phillies executive Bill Giles.\n\n\nThe Phillies returned to the playoffs in 1981, which were split in half due to a players' strike. In five games, they were defeated in the first-ever National League Division Series by the Montreal Expos. Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive NL Most Valuable Player award that year. In 1982, the team finished three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the East Division, narrowly missing the playoffs. Carlton captured his fourth career NL Cy Young Award that year with 23 wins. \n\n\nFor the 1983 season, the Phillies returned to the playoffs and beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games. John Denny was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, *Philadelphia Daily News* sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the \"Wheeze Kids\".[33]\n\n\nIn 1984, the team finished fourth in the NL East with a record of 81\u201381. Mike Schmidt still remained a dominant force on the team by leading the National League in both home runs and runs batted in.\n\n\n\n### Years of struggle (1985\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1985 season was the first time the team finished below .500 since 1974. The team had some success in 1986 despite having released star pitcher Steve Carlton due to injuries. They went on to finish second in the division with a record of 86\u201375. Mike Schmidt led the National League in home runs and runs batted in that year and also won his third National League Most Valuable Player award, sixth Silver Slugger award and tenth Gold Glove.\n\n\nIn 1987, closer Steve Bedrosian was named the NL Cy Young Award winner. \n\n\nInjuries caused Mike Schmidt to miss most of the 1988 season and he retired from baseball after playing in only 42 games in 1989, thus, the last member of the 1980 championship team was gone.\n\n\nIn 1990, Terry Mulholland lost a perfect game in the seventh inning when a San Francisco Giants' batter reached base on a throwing error. The next batter grounded into a double play. Thus, Mulholland faced the perfect-game maximum of 27 batters, but did not qualify for a perfect game. He was credited, however, with a no-hitter.[34]\n\n\nDuring this time, the Phillies often struggled to attract more than 25,000 people to Veterans Stadium, the biggest in the National League at the time (at over 62,000 seats). Even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment.\n\n\n\n### Macho Row (1992\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1993 World Series\n\n![Photograph of Phillies' catch Darren Daulton looking to his left](image)Darren Daulton, Phillies' catcher in the 1983 season and from 1985 to 1997\nBefore the 1992 season, the organization decided to shed the maroon uniform and logo and use colors similar to those used during the days of the \"Whiz Kids\". The season ended with the Phillies at the bottom of the standings\u2014last place in the National League East. However, their fortunes were about to change.\n\n\nThe 1993 Phillies were led by stars such as Darren Daulton, John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, and Curt Schilling. The team was dubbed \"Macho Row\" for their shaggy, unkempt, and dirty look. Their character endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following season. \n\n\nThe team powered their way to a 97\u201365 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17\u20135. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.\n\n\nThey beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series.[35] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies' loss.[36]\n\n\nThe 1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike was a blow to attendance and on-field success, as was the arrival of the Atlanta Braves in the division due to league realignment. Several players from the 1993 team were either traded or left the team soon after.\n\n\n\n### Rebuilding years (1996\u20132005)[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of the interior of Citizens Bank Park showing the field and seatring](image)Citizens Bank Park, home field of the Philadelphia Phillies since 2004\nThe team drafted third baseman Scott Rolen in the second round of the 1993 amateur draft. He had reached the majors by 1996 and was named National League Rookie of the Year in 1997. After becoming frustrated with management he demanded a trade and was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2002.\n\n\nFormer Phillie Larry Bowa was hired as manager for the 2001 season, and led the Phillies to an 86\u201376 record, their first winning season since the 1993 World Series year. They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the end, they finished two games out of first. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year.\n\n\nThe Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the only blemish being an 80\u201381 season in 2002. On December 6, 2002, Jim Thome, a free agent, signed a six-year, $85\u00a0million contract with the team.[37]\n\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, the team drafted players who would soon become the core of the team including Jimmy Rollins, Pat Burrell, Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, and Cole Hamels. In 2004, the Phillies moved to their new home, Citizens Bank Park,[38] across the street from Veterans Stadium.\n\n\nCharlie Manuel took over the club's reins from Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by Pat Gillick in November 2005. Gillick reshaped the club as his own, bringing in players such as Shane Victorino, Jayson Werth, and Jamie Moyer.\n\n\n\n### The Golden era (2006\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2008 World Series, 2009 World Series, and Roy Halladay's perfect game\n\n![](image)Jimmy Rollins, Phillies' shortstop from 2000 to 2014\nRyan Howard won the NL Most Valuable Player Award for the 2006 season and Jimmy Rollins won the award the following year. After the franchise lost its 10,000th game in 2007,[12] its core of young players responded by winning the National League East division title, but they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the Division Series.[39] After the 2007 season, they acquired closer Brad Lidge through a trade with the Houston Astros.\n\n\n\n#### 2008 World Series champions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 World Series\n\nSee also: Curse of Billy Penn\n\nThough the Phillies were named in some publications as the favorites to repeat as division champions in 2008, they did not get off to the blazing April start that many had hoped for. Still, they managed their first winning opening month since 2003, and only their fourth since their last World Series appearance.\n\n\n\nChase Utley and Brad Lidge represented the team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game,[40] with Utley garnering the most votes of all National League players.[41] In a move to bolster their starting rotation in preparation for the pennant race, the Phillies traded three minor league players to the Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17.[42]\n\n![](image)Cole Hamels, Phillies' pitcher from 2006 to 2015, was named MVP of the 2008 World SeriesOn September 27, the Phillies clinched the National League East for the second year in a row. They won the NLDS three games to one against the Milwaukee Brewers, and they defeated the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4\u20131. As the National League champions, the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays, winning the series 4 games to 1. Game 5 began on Monday, October 27, and was suspended after the top of the 6th inning, with the scored tied 2-2. The game resumed Wednesday, October 29, with the Phillies winning the game 4-3 and capturing their second world series in franchise history. Prior to this, there had never been a rain-shortened game in World Series history, and this was the first suspension. Cole Hamels won the Most Valuable Player Award for both the NLCS and the World Series. \n\n\nPat Gillick retired as general manager after the 2008 season and was succeeded by one of his assistants, Rub\u00e9n Amaro Jr. After adding outfielder Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez to replace the departed Pat Burrell, the Phillies retained the majority of their core players for the 2009 season. In July, they signed three-time Cy Young Award winner Pedro Mart\u00ednez and acquired 2008 American League Cy Young winner Cliff Lee before the trade deadline. On September 30, 2009, they clinched a third consecutive National League East Division title for the first time since the 1976\u201378 seasons.\n\n\n\nThe team beat the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS to become the first Phillies team to win back-to-back pennants and the first National League team since the 1996 Atlanta Braves to have an opportunity to defend their World Series title. However, the Phillies were unable to repeat the 2008 World Series victory; they were defeated in the 2009 series by the New York Yankees, four games to two. In recognition of the team's recent accomplishments, *Baseball America* named the Phillies its Organization of the Year.[43]\n\n![Photograph of Chase Utley, Phillies' second baseman from 2003 to 2015 running](image)Chase Utley, Phillies' second baseman from 2003 to 2015On December 16, 2009, they acquired starting pitcher Roy Halladay from the Toronto Blue Jays for three minor-league prospects,[44] and traded Cliff Lee to the Seattle Mariners for three prospects.[45] On May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched a perfect game against the Florida Marlins.[d] In June 2010, the team's scheduled series against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre was moved to Philadelphia, because of security concerns for the G-20 Summit. The Blue Jays wore their home white uniforms and batted last as the home team, and the designated hitter was used.[46] The game was the first occasion of the use of a designated hitter in a National League ballpark in a regular-season game; Ryan Howard was the first player to fill the role.[47]\nThe 2010 Phillies won their fourth consecutive NL East Division championship[48][49] despite a rash of significant injuries to key players.[50] After dropping seven games behind the Atlanta Braves on July 21, Philadelphia finished with an MLB-best record of 97\u201365.[51] The streak included a 20\u20135 record in September, the Phillies' best September since winning 22 games that month in 1983,[52] and an 11\u20130 run in the middle of the month.[53] The acquisition of pitcher Roy Oswalt in early August was a key step, as Oswalt won seven consecutive games in just over five weeks from August 11 through September 17.[53] The Phillies clinched the division on September 27, behind a two-hit shutout by Halladay.[54]\n\n![Photograph of Ryan Howard, Phillies' first baseman from 2004 to 2016](image)Ryan Howard, Phillies' first baseman from 2004 to 2016In Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series, Halladay threw the second no-hitter in Major League Baseball postseason history, leading the Phillies over the Cincinnati Reds, 4\u20130. (The first was New York Yankees pitcher Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.[55]) Halladay's no-hitter was the fifth time a pitcher has thrown two no-hitters in the same season, and was also the first time that one of the two occurred in the postseason. The Phillies went on to sweep the Reds in three straight games. \n\n\nIn the 2010 National League Championship Series, the Phillies fell to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants in six games. Halladay was named the 2010 NL Cy Young Award winner.\n\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2011 season, the Phillies signed pitcher Cliff Lee to a five-year deal, bringing him back to the team and forming a formidable rotation of Halladay, Lee, Hamels, Oswalt, and Blanton. Including Vance Worley, who replaced Joe Blanton due to injury. The rotation combined for a win\u2013loss record of 71\u201338, and an earned run average of 2.86, the best in the majors that year. Commentators called it one of the best rotations ever assembled.[56][57][58][59] Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed two nicknames by fans and media: the \"Phantastic Phour\" and \"The Four Aces\".[58] On September 17, 2011, the Phillies won their fifth consecutive East Division championship,[60] and on September 28, during the final game of the season, the team set a franchise record for victories in a season with 102 by beating the Atlanta Braves in 13 innings, denying their division rivals a potential wild card berth.[61] Yet the Phillies lost in the NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals\u2014the team that won the National League Wild Card as a result of the Phillies beating the Braves. The Cardinals subsequently beat the Brewers in the NLCS and won the 2011 World Series in seven games over the Texas Rangers. \n\n![](image)Roy Halladay, Phillies' pitcher from 2010 to 2013 and a 2019 Hall of Fame inducteeThe 2012 Phillies experienced an up and down season. They played .500 ball through the first two months, but then slumped through a 9\u201319 stretch in June where they ended up at the bottom of the NL East by mid-season. With any hope dimming, the Phillies traded key players Shane Victorino and Joe Blanton to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Hunter Pence to the San Francisco Giants before the trade deadline. A hot start in the second half of the season put the Phillies back on the postseason hunt, but any hope was eventually extinguished with a loss to the Washington Nationals on September 28, costing the Phillies the postseason for the first time since 2006.\n\n\nThe Phillies' win\u2013loss record never went below .500 during this time; and the team won the NL East five years in a row from 2007 to 2011.[62]\n\n\n\n### End of an era (2013\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 season, the team struggled again and was unable to consistently play well for the majority of the season. On August 16, 2013, with the team's record at 53\u201368, the Phillies fired manager Charlie Manuel, who had managed the team since 2005,[63] and promoted third-base coach Ryne Sandberg to interim manager. Manuel had spent over nine years as manager, leading Philadelphia to its first World Series victory in nearly 30 years and amassing an overall record of 780\u2013636 to become the manager with the most wins in the franchise's history. The 2013 Phillies ended up with a record of 73\u201389, their first losing season since 2002. In the off-season, pitcher Roy Halladay retired from baseball.\n\n\nIn the 2014 season, one of the few bright spots was the September 1 game against a division rival, the Atlanta Braves, when starter Cole Hamels and relievers Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon combined for a no-hitter at Turner Field and a 7\u20130 victory over Atlanta. In the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft the Phillies selected pitcher Aaron Nola with the 7th overall pick. The team could not gain momentum during the season and finished last in the NL East, the first time they had done so since 2000. During the off-season, Jimmy Rollins waived his no-trade clause and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, while Cliff Lee pitched his last game and was sidelined for the entire 2015 season due to injury. \n\n\nIn 2015, attendance began to drop as the team showed little improvement and it was clear that the remnants of the 2008 World Series team would soon be departing. Sandberg resigned as manager and bench coach Pete Mackanin was brought in as interim manager. Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5\u20130 at Wrigley Field, on July 25, striking out 13 and giving up only two walks.[64] It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965, and first at Wrigley Field since the Cubs' Milt Pappas in 1972.[65] Hamels was dealt to the Texas Rangers, six days later.[66][67] The following month saw the departure of Chase Utley who was traded to the Dodgers. In September, general manager Rub\u00e9n Amaro Jr. was fired and Andy MacPhail was brought in as the interim general manager.[68] The team once again finished last in the NL East with a record of 63\u201399. McPhail was officially named the organization's President of Baseball Operations during the off season.[69] The team then hired Matt Klentak as the new general manager. \n\n\nIn 2016, the team finished fourth in the NL East, only winning eight more games than they had the previous year, with a 71\u201391 record. The 2016 season was the last for both Ryan Howard and Carlos Ruiz in a Phillies' uniform. Ruiz was traded to the Dodgers in late August, reuniting him with Chase Utley. The team decided to not exercise their club option on Howard, thus making him a free agent. \n\n\nOn September 29, 2017, Pete Mackanin was fired as manager. The Phillies announced Gabe Kapler as their new manager on October 30, 2017.[70] Kapler had been the Director of Player Development for the Los Angeles Dodgers since November 2014. He led the Phillies in the right direction in the first half of the 2018 season, as they had a 59\u201348 record at the July 31st trade deadline and were leading the NL East division by 1.5 games over the Atlanta Braves.[71] However, a late-season collapse where they went 21\u201334 from August to the end of the season led to the Phillies finishing with an 80\u201382 record and third in the division. Aaron Nola amassed a record of 17\u20136 with a 2.37 earned run average and 0.975 WHIP.[72] He finished third in the National League Cy Young race, behind the Nationals' Max Scherzer and the winner, the Mets' Jacob DeGrom.[73]\n\n\n\n### Building a winning team (2019\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 World Series\n\n![](image)In 2019, the Phillies signed right fielder and designated hitter Bryce Harper to a 13-year, $330 million contract.\nThe Phillies intended to start targeting valuable free agents as soon as the 2018 season was over. Owner John Middleton said they were willing to \"spend stupid money\".[74] During the off-season, the Phillies signed Andrew McCutchen, David Robertson, and made the splash of the offseason by signing Bryce Harper to a 13-year, $330\u00a0million deal, taking him away from the division rival Washington Nationals. The team also made many trades, including trading for the Mariners' shortstop Jean Segura and the Marlins' catcher J.T. Realmuto.[75] The Phillies got off to a hot start the first two months, going 33\u201322 but collapsed from there. They were eliminated from the playoffs on September 24 in the first game of a day-night double-header against Harper's former team and the eventual World Series champions, the Nationals, on their way to finishing with a record of 81\u201381. Owner John Middleton fired Manager Gabe Kapler on October 10, 2019, after ten days of intense deliberations with insiders and outsiders alike.[76]\n\n\nOn October 24, 2019, the Philadelphia Phillies announced Joe Girardi as their 55th manager of the team, signing a three-year deal with the Phillies with an option for the 2023 season.[77]\n\n\nThe team failed to get a winning season in the COVID-shortened 2020 season and finished with a 28-32 record and failed to enter the playoffs, and the Miami Marlins, a team sometimes ridiculed as weaker than Phillies, ended up getting in playoffs in 2020, so on October 3, 2020, Matt Klentak was relieved from General Manager.[78] On December 11, 2020, the Phillies hired Dave Dombrowski as the President Of Baseball Operations.[79] On December 22, 2020, Dombrowski hired Sam Fuld as the General Manager.[80]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Phillies finished the season with an 82-80 record, the first winning season since 2011, but failed to make the playoffs. One major highlight of the season was Bryce Harper winning the NL Most Valuable Player Award for the 2021 season. The team targeted high profile free agents during the offseason and improved their lineup by signing outfielders Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos. \n\n\nThe Phillies got off to a sluggish 22\u201329 start to the 2022 season. On June 3, the Phillies fired manager Joe Girardi and replaced him with bench coach Rob Thomson, who was named the team's interim manager.[81] The Phillies ended the 2022 season 87\u201375, reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2011. \n\n\nIn the postseason, the Phillies traveled to St. Louis to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Wild Card Series for a best of three series, winning in two games.[82] They went on to eliminate the defending World Champion Atlanta Braves three games to one in the National League Division Series, advancing to the National League Championship Series where they would face the San Diego Padres. The Phillies won the series four games to one and would advance to the 2022 World Series.[83] Bryce Harper was named MVP of the NLCS. On October 10, the Phillies also removed the interim role of Thomson and named him the team's manager.\n\n\nThe Phillies faced the American League champion Houston Astros in a best of seven World Series that began October 28 at Minute Maid Park in Houston. The Astros entered the series as the top seeded team in the American League and with an undefeated record in the postseason of 7-0.[84] Game 1 ended with the Phillies winning the game in extra innings by a score of 6-5, with catcher J.T. Realmuto hitting the game winning home run in the top of the 10th inning.[85] The Astros would even the series at 1-1 in Game 2, with the series going to Philadelphia for the first time since 2009. Game 3 at Citizens Bank Park was originally scheduled to take place on October 31, but was postponed until the following day due to rain, which also moved the rest of the series games back by a day. The Phillies would take Game 3 by a score of 7-0, which was a result of the team hitting five home runs in the first five innings of the game, the first time this had occurred in World Series history.[86] All five home runs were given up by Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., which became a record for most home runs surrendered by a pitcher in a World Series game.[87] In Game 4, the Astros answered back by winning the game 5-0 and throwing a combined no-hitter, the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and just the second no-hitter of any type in a World Series after Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.[88] The Astros won the next two games, winning the series four games to two. The Phillies' game six loss, coming shortly after the Philadelphia Union fell in the championship game of the MLS Cup, made Philadelphia the first American city to lose two major professional sports championship title games in the same day. Later the Philadelphia Eagles would also lose a third final in a major sport coming from the Super Bowl LVII when they lost to another south team Kansas City Chiefs thus making the first time all three teams in the same city lose three consecutive finals in history.[89]\n\n\n\n## Team uniforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major League Baseball uniforms\n\n### Current uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe current team colors, uniform, and logo date back to 1992. The main team colors are red and white, with blue serving as a prominent accent. The team name is written in red with a blue star serving as the dot over the \"i\"s, and blue piping is often found in Phillies' branded apparel and materials. The team's home uniform is white with red pinstripes, lettering and numbering. The road uniform is traditional grey with red lettering/numbering. Both bear a script-lettered \"Phillies\" logo, with the aforementioned star dotting the \"i\"s across the chest, and the player name and number on the back. The uniform's front script has undergone minor changes over the years.[90] Hats are red with a single stylized \"P\".[91] The uniforms and logo are very similar to those used during the \"Whiz Kids\" era from 1950 to 1969.\n\n\nThe Phillies and the St. Louis Cardinals are the only MLB teams to use chain stitching in their chest emblems.\n\n\nIn 2008, the Phillies introduced an alternate, cream-colored uniform during home day games\u2014a tribute to their 125th anniversary. The uniforms are similar to those worn from 1946 through 1949, featuring red lettering bordered with blue piping and lacking pinstripes.[92] The accompanying cap is blue with a red bill and a red stylized \"P\". The uniforms were announced on November 29, 2007, when Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, pitcher Cole Hamels, and Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts modeled the new uniforms.[93]\n\n\nFor the 2009 season the Phillies wore black, circular \"HK\" patches over their hearts in memory of broadcaster Harry Kalas, who died April 13, 2009, just before he was to broadcast a Phillies game in Washington, D.C. From Opening Day through July 26, 2009, the Phillies wore 2008 World Champions patches on the right sleeve of their home uniforms to celebrate their World Series victory the season prior. After the death of Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts on May 6, 2010, the Phillies wore a black patch with a white \"36\" on the sleeves of their jerseys in memory of Roberts for the remainder of the 2010 season. Number 36 had been retired previously by the team in 1962 to honor Roberts. For the 2011 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch with a \"B\" in honor of minority owners Alexander and John Buck, who died in late 2010. For the 2014 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch with initials \u201cCB\u201d in honor of former owner Claire Betz, who died during the offseason. For the 2015 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch with a white \"SLB\" in memory of minority owner Sara L. Buck, who died on August 23, 2014. For the 2017 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch on their sleeves featuring the \"baseball stitched\" center swirl \"P\" used from 1970 to 1991 inside the white silhouette of a capital \"D\" in memory of former manager Dallas Green, who led the franchise to its first World Series championship and died on March 22, 2017.[94] Following the death of former chairman, minority-owner, and president David Montgomery on May 8, 2019, the Phillies added a black circular patch with white \"DPM\" letters in memory of Montgomery for the remainder of the 2019 season.[95] For the 2021 season, the Phillies wore a patch with the number \"15\" on it in honor of former player Dick Allen, who died the previous year.[96]\n\n\nIn 2016, the Phillies added a red alternate uniform, similar to their spring training uniforms, to be used for mid-week afternoon games. It was unofficially retired following the 2017 season, after which the Phillies revived their powder blue throwbacks as an alternate uniform to be used on select Thursday home games. The red alternates were brought back for select road games in 2021, and became the team's preferred uniform during \"getaway day\" road games.\n\n\nThe Phillies are one of four teams in Major League Baseball that do not display the name of their city, state, or region on their road jerseys, joining the Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, and the Tampa Bay Rays. Until 2022, the Phillies were the only team that also displayed the player's number on one sleeve, except on the alternate jersey, in addition to the usual placement on the back of the jersey. Since 2023, the sleeves on the Phillies' primary uniforms were left blank in anticipation of a future uniform sponsor.\n\n\n\n![Ryan Howard wearing the current Phillies' white home uniform with red pinstripes and the Harry Kalas patch in 2009](image)\nRyan Howard wearing the current Phillies' home uniform (with Harry Kalas patch in 2009)\n![Jim Thome wearing the Phillies' grey road uniform.](image)\nJim Thome wearing the Phillies' grey road uniform\n![Photograph of Joe Blanton wearing the Phillies' alternate cream-colored uniform with a Kalas patch](image)\nJoe Blanton wearing the alternate Phillies' home uniform (with Kalas patch in 2009)\n![Darick Hall wearing the Phillies' powder blue alternate throwback uniform](image)\nDarick Hall wearing the Phillies' alternate throwback uniform\n![Didi Gregorius wearing the Phillies' alternate red uniform](image)\nDidi Gregorius wearing the Phillies' alternate red uniform\n\n### Batting practice[edit]\n\n\nThe Phillies were an early adopter of the batting practice jersey in 1977, wearing a maroon v-necked top with the \"Phillies\" script name across the chest, as well as the player name and number on the back and a player number on the left sleeve, all in white. Larry Bowa, Pete Rose, and Mike Schmidt wore this maroon batting jersey in place of their road jersey during the 1979 All-Star Game in Seattle. Currently, during spring training, the Phillies wear solid red practice jerseys with pinstriped pants for Grapefruit League home games. The red jerseys are worn with grey pants on the road.\n\n\n\n### Former uniforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Phillies turn back the clock games\n\nFrom 1970 to 1991, the Phillies sported colors, uniforms, and a logo that were noticeably different from what had come before, or since, but that were widely embraced by even traditionally minded fans. A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies \"P\" that, thanks to its unique shape and \"baseball stitched\" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. It was while wearing this uniform style and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983.[90] Its continued popularity with fans is still evident. Even today, Phillies' home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets emblazoned with the iconic \"P\" and burgundy color scheme. The current team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era. Additionally, this uniform also marked the first appearance of \"racing stripes\" on a baseball uniform (striping going down the jersey shoulders, the side of the pants and up to the sides of the jersey up to the armpit), which would be seen on several other MLB teams for the next quarter-century.\n\n\n\n### Controversial uniform changes[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, the Phillies' front office modified the uniform into an all-burgundy version with white trimmings, to be worn for Saturday games.[97] They were called \"Saturday Night Specials\" and were worn for the first and last time on May 19, 1979,[98] a 10\u20135 loss to the Montreal Expos.[99] The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players alike was negative, with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. As such, the idea was hastily abandoned.[100] Mike Schmidt did wear the uniform during the MLB All-Star Tour of Japan following the 1979 season. During the closing ceremonies at Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003, there was a procession of former players during the post-game ceremony, most in uniform. Larry Christenson, the starting pitcher in the original game, came out wearing this old burgundy uniform, and was the only one to do so. The Phillies wore this jersey again for the 40th anniversary of the original game on July 27, 2019. Christenson threw out the ceremonial first pitch. They lost to the Atlanta Braves 15\u20137.[101]\n\n\nAnother uniform controversy arose in 1994, when the Phillies introduced all-blue caps on Opening Day that were to be worn for home day games only.[102] The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well to fans. A compromise was reached: the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games.[103] In all, the Phillies wore the \"unlucky\" blue caps for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5\u20132 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29).[104] A slightly different blue cap (with a red bill) was introduced in 2008 as part of the alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nThe Phillies had several notable rivalries through history as they often clashed frequently against the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers during the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s. The Phillies often faced heated postseason matchups against both teams, meeting the Dodgers five times in the NLCS; while also meeting the Braves twice in the NLDS and once in the NLCS.\n\n\n\n### New York Mets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry\n\n![Photograph of the Phillies playing division rival New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park](image)The Phillies play division rival New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park on September 29, 2017\nThe rivalry between the New York Mets and the Phillies has been said to be among the \"hottest\" rivalries in the National League.[105][106] The two National League East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, division, and wild card races.\n\n\nAside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season,[107] as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011.[108] The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining.\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Pirates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phillies\u2013Pirates rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League.[109][110][111] The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered National League play in their fifth season of 1887, four years after the Phillies.[112]\n\n\nThe Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969\u20131993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s,[112][113] the Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.[114]\n\n\nAfter the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other in only two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.[111] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.[115] The rivalry between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League is also fiercely contested.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Washington Nationals/Montreal Expos[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nationals\u2013Phillies rivalry\n\nThe Phillies' rivalry with the Washington Nationals extends back during their original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise's relocation to Washington DC in 2005; the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington's proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019; star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent.[117][118] The Nationals later managed to win the 2019 World Series during the first year of Harper's absence.[119] The Phillies currently lead the series 482-445, but the Nationals lead the postseason series; when the Expos managed a 3-2 victory over the Phillies during the 1981 NLDS.\n\n\n\n### Historical rivalries[edit]\n\n\n#### City Series: Philadelphia Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City Series (Philadelphia)\n\nThe City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at Oakland Coliseum, the Athletics did not bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.[120]\n\n\nThe first City Series was held in 1883 between the Phillies and the American Association's Athletics.[121] When the Athletics first joined the American League, the two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No City Series was held in 1901 and 1902 due to legal warring between the National and American Leagues.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Philadelphia Phillies roster* v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| Active roster\n | Inactive roster\n | Coaches/Other\n |\n| **Pitchers**\n**Starting rotation**\n* 27 Aaron Nola\n* 61 Cristopher S\u00e1nchez\n* 55 Ranger Su\u00e1rez\n* 22 Spencer Turnbull\n* 99 Taijuan Walker\n* 45 Zack Wheeler\n\n**Bullpen**\n* 46 Jos\u00e9 Alvarado\n* 58 Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez\n* 23 Jeff Hoffman\n* 50 Orion Kerkering\n* 66 Jos\u00e9 Ruiz\n* 30 Gregory Soto\n* 25 Matt Strahm\n\n\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 13 Rafael March\u00e1n\n* 21 Garrett Stubbs\n\n**Infielders**\n* 28 Alec Bohm\n* 3 Bryce Harper\n* 33 Edmundo Sosa\n* 5 Bryson Stott\n* 37 Weston Wilson\n\n**Outfielders**\n* 8 Nick Castellanos\n* 35 David Dahl\n* 9 Whit Merrifield\n* 19 Cristian Pache\n* 18 Johan Rojas\n\n**Designated hitters**\n* 12 Kyle Schwarber\n |  | **Pitchers**\n* 49 Kolby Allard\n* 68 Max Castillo\n* 43 Yunior Marte ![](image)\n* 63 Michael Mercado\n* 57 Nick Nelson\n* 56 Luis F.

Manuel and Dallas Green are the only Phillies' managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980 against the Kansas City Royals; and Manuel in 2008 against the Tampa Bay Rays.[124] Charlie Manuel is the longest-tenured manager in franchise history, with 1,416 games of service in parts of nine seasons (2005\u20132013).[125] The records and accomplishments of Phillies' managers since 1991 are shown below \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **WPct** | Winning percentage: number of wins divided by number of games managed\n |\n| **PA** | Playoff appearances: number of years this manager has led the franchise to the playoffs |\n| **PW** | Playoff wins: number of wins this manager has accrued in the playoffs\n |\n| **PL** | Playoff losses: number of losses this manager has accrued in the playoffs\n |\n| **WS** | World Series: number of World Series victories achieved by the manager\n |\n| \u2020 *or* \u2021 | Elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (\u2021 denotes induction as manager)[126] |\n| \u00a7 | Member of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n| #[a] | Manager | Years | Wins | Losses | Ties | WPct | PA | PW | PL | WS | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 47 | Jim Fregosi | 1991\u20131996 | 431 | 463 | 0 | .482 | 1 | 6 | 6 | 0 | [127][128] |\n| 48 | Terry Francona | 1997\u20132000 | 285 | 363 | 0 | .440 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [129] |\n| 49 | Larry Bowa\u00a7[b] | 2001\u20132004 | 337 | 308 | 0 | .522 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [130] |\n| 50 | Gary Varsho | 2004 | 1 | 1 | 0 | .500 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [131] |\n| 51 | Charlie Manuel\u00a7 | 2005\u20132013 | 780 | 636 | 0 | .551 | 5 | 27 | 18 | 1 | [132][133][134][135] |\n| 52 | Ryne Sandberg\u2020 | 2013\u20132015 | 119 | 159 | 0 | .428 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | [136] |\n| 53 | Pete Mackanin | 2015\u20132017 | 174 | 238 | 0 | .422 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  |\n| 54 | Gabe Kapler | 2018\u20132019 | 161 | 163 | 0 | .497 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  |\n| 55 | Joe Girardi |  2020\u20132022 | 132 | 141 | 0 | .484 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  |\n| 56 | Rob Thomson |  2022\u2013present | 173 | 128 | 0 | .575 | 2 | 16 | 7 | 0 |  |\n\n\n*Statistics current through April 28, 2024* \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Phillies award winners and league leaders\n\nSix Phillies have won Most Valuable Player Awards during their career with the team. Mike Schmidt leads with three wins, with back-to-back MVPs in 1980 and 1981, and in 1986 as well. Chuck Klein (1932), Jim Konstanty (1950), Ryan Howard (2006), Jimmy Rollins (2007), and Bryce Harper (2021) all have one.[137] Pitcher Steve Carlton leads the team in Cy Young Award wins with four (1972, 1977, 1980, and 1982), while John Denny (1983), Steve Bedrosian (1987), and Roy Halladay (2010) each have one.[137] Four Phillies have won Rookie of the Year honors as well. Jack Sanford won in 1957, Dick Allen in 1964. Third baseman Scott Rolen brought home the honors in 1997, while Howard was the most recent Phillies' winner in 2005.[138] In doing so, Howard became only the second player in MLB history to win Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in consecutive years, Cal Ripken Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles being the first.[139]\n\n\nOf the 18 players who have hit four home runs in one game, three were Phillies at the time (more than any other team).[140] Ed Delahanty was the first, hitting his four in Chicago's West Side Park on July 13, 1896. Chuck Klein repeated the feat nearly 40 years later to the day, on July 10, 1936, at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. Forty years later, on April 17, 1976, Mike Schmidt became the third, with his hits in Chicago at Wrigley Field.\n\n\n\n### Hall of Famers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame\n\n*See footnote*[141]\n\n\n| Philadelphia Phillies Hall of Famers\n |\n| --- |\n| Affiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n |\n| \n\n**Philadelphia Phillies**\n| Grover Cleveland Alexander \\*Sparky Anderson**Richie Ashburn** \\*Dave Bancroft \\*Chief BenderDan Brouthers**Jim Bunning**\n |  | **Steve Carlton** \\*[142]Roger ConnorEd Delahanty \\*Hugh DuffyJohnny EversElmer FlickJimmie FoxxPat Gillick\n |  | Roy Halladay[143]Billy Hamilton \\*Bucky HarrisFerguson JenkinsHughie JenningsJim KaatTim Keefe**Chuck Klein** \\*\n |  | Nap LajoiePedro Mart\u00ednez[144]Tommy McCarthyJoe MorganKid NicholsTony P\u00e9rezEppa Rixey**Robin Roberts** \\*\n |  | Scott Rolen \\* Ryne Sandberg**Mike Schmidt**[145]\\*Casey StengelJim ThomeSam Thompson \\*Lloyd WanerHack WilsonHarry Wright \\*\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n* Players and managers listed in **bold** are depicted on their Hall of Fame plaques wearing a Phillies cap insignia.\n* \\* Philadelphia Phillies listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*\n |\n\n\n### Ford C.

Of the eight players with retired numbers, seven were retired for their play with the Phillies and one, 42, was universally retired by Major League Baseball when they honored the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color barrier. \n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| RichieAshburnCF, TVRetired 1979[147] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| JimBunningRHPRetired 2001[148] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| DickAllen1B, 3BRetired 2020 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| MikeSchmidt3BRetired 1990[149] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| SteveCarltonLHPRetired 1989[150] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| RoyHalladayRHPRetired 2021 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| RobinRobertsRHPRetired 1962[151] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| JackieRobinson2BRetired by MLB 1997[152] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Grover C.AlexanderRHPHonored 2001[a][153] |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| ChuckKleinRFHonored 2001[b][154] |\n\n |\n\n\n### Wall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame\n\nFrom 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one former Phillie and one former member of the Philadelphia Athletics per year. Since 2004 they have inducted one Phillie annually. Players must be retired and must have played at least four years with the Phillies or Athletics. In March 2004, the Athletics plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack located across the street from Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies' inductees to the Wall of Fame are listed below (note that there was no inductee for the 2017 season, as Pete Rose was intended to be inducted, but was not due to controversial allegations):\n\n\nThe Wall of Fame was located in Ashburn Alley at Citizens Bank Park from 2004 to 2017, until the 2018 season when it was relocated to a more spacious location behind the stadium's left-field scoreboard.\n\n\n\n![](image)Chuck Klein, 1980 Wall of Fame inductee\n![A dark bronze plaque listing the names and positions of members of the Centennial team in gold lettering](image)Phillies Centennial Team, 1983 Wall of Fame inductees\n![Mike Schmidt's bronze 1990 Wall of Fame plaque](image)Mike Schmidt, 1990 Wall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Dick Allen, 1994 Wall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Tug McGraw, 1998 Wall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Garry Maddox, 2001 Wall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Pat Burrell, 2015 Wall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Jim Thome, 2016 Wall of Fame inductee\n![](image)Bobby Abreu, 2019 Wall of Fame inductee\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u2020\n | Member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |\n| **Bold** | Recipient of the Hall of Fame's Ford C.

The broadcasts were discontinued on the former AM flagship station WPHT 1210 in 2016.[199] Scott Franzke provides play-by-play on the radio, with Larry Andersen, Michael Bourn, Chad Durbin, Erik Kratz, and Kevin Stocker as color commentators. Meanwhile, NBCUniversal (a unit of Philadelphia-based Comcast) handles local television broadcasts through its properties NBC Sports Philadelphia and WCAU (NBC Channel 10). WCAU broadcasts are syndicated to WHP-DT2 in Harrisburg and WQMY-TV in Wilkes-Barre. Tom McCarthy calls play-by-play for the television broadcasts, with John Kruk, Ruben Amaro Jr,[200] Ben Davis, and Mike Schmidt[201] providing color commentary.\n\n\nSpanish language broadcasts are on WTTM (1680 AM)[202] with Oscar Budejen on play-by-play, and Bill Kulik on color commentary.\n\n\nOther popular Phillies broadcasters through the years include By Saam (1939\u20131975), Bill Campbell (1962\u20131970), Richie Ashburn (1963\u20131997), and Harry Kalas (1971\u20132009).[203] Kalas, a 2002 recipient of the Ford Frick Award and an icon in the Philadelphia area, called play-by-play in the first three and last three innings on television and the fourth inning on the radio until his death on April 13, 2009.\n\n\nAt Citizens Bank Park, the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named \"Harry the K's\" in Kalas' honor. After his death, the Phillies' TV broadcast booth was renamed \"The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth\". It is directly next to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named \"The Richie 'Whitey' Ashburn Broadcast Booth\". When the Phillies win at home, Kalas' rendition of the song \"High Hopes\", which he would sing when the Phillies had clinched a playoff berth or advanced in the playoffs, is played as fans file out of the stadium. In addition, when a Phillies player hits a home run, a recording of Kalas' famous \"That ball is outta here!\" home run call is played. The sole exception is Chase Utley, once the subject of another famous Kalas call, \"Chase Utley, you are The Man!\", which was played when Utley hit a homer.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Phillies unveiled a statue of Harry Kalas at Citizens Bank Park. It was funded by Phillies' fans and designed and constructed by a Phillies' fan.\n\n\nThe Phillies' public-address (PA) announcer is Dan Baker, who started in the 1972 season.[204][205]\n\n\nIn 2011, the Phillies spent $10\u00a0million to upgrade the video system at Citizens Bank Park, including a new display screen in left field, making it the largest in the National League at 76 feet high and 97 feet wide.[206][207]\n\n\n\n## Community[edit]\n\n\n### Charitable contributions[edit]\n\n\nSince 1984, the Phillies have supported research related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) with the \"Phillies Phestival\".[208] The team raised over US$750,000 for ALS research at their 2008 festival, compared with approximately $4,500 at the inaugural event in 1984;[208] the event has raised over $10\u00a0million in its history.[209] The ALS Association of Philadelphia is the Phillies' primary charity,[210] and the hospitals they support include Pennsylvania Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, and Hahnemann University Hospital.[208] Former Phillies' pitchers Geoff Geary, who lost a friend to the disease,[211] and Curt Schilling, who retired with the Boston Red Sox,[212] are still involved with the Phillies' cause.\n\n\n\n### Education and anti-drug programs[edit]\n\n\nThe Phillies have a reading incentive program called Phanatic About Reading, which is designed to encourage students from kindergarten to eighth grade to read for a minimum of 15 minutes a night. This reading program is designed to help students with their literacy skills and comprehension. Phillies Phundamentals is another educational program, offered through after-school and summer camps, that is designed to make learning fun and support academic skills by using baseball.\n\n\nThe Phillies celebrate teachers during their annual Teacher Appreciation Night.[213]\n\n\nThe \u201cCut Out Overdoses\u201d anti-drug campaign, sponsored by Mothers Against Prescription Drug Abuse (MAPDA) and Emergent Biosolutions, manufacturer of the overdose antagonist Narcan, highlights the drug overdose problem through special communications programs at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies. (There are identical programs supported by both the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds.) In 2020, the stadium, fan-empty due to the coronavirus pandemic, featured \u201ccut-out\u201d cardboard figures of fans filling the stands. Clicking on one of the silhouettes leads to the anguished story of the overdose death of an individual, written by family members. The story also encourages readers to take a stand by learning more about opioid-reversal medication and making a donation to MAPDA. The site reports that an American dies from an accidental opioid overdose every 15 minutes, over 35,000 people annually.[214]\n\n\n\n### Fan support and reputation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phillies fans, who have a reputation for occasional unruly behavior, brawl with New York Mets fans at Shea Stadium in September 2007\nPhillies' fans have earned a reputation over the years for their occasional unruly behavior. In the 1960s, radio announcers for visiting teams would frequently report on the numerous fights breaking out in Connie Mack Stadium.[215] Immediately after the final game at the old park, many fans ran onto the field or dislodged parts of the ballpark to take home with them.[216] Later, at Veterans Stadium, the 700 Level gained a reputation for its \"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness\".[217] Phillies fans are famously known for their reputation for being the \"Meanest Fans in America\".[218]\n\n\nPhillies' fans are known for harsh criticism of their own stars such the 1964 Rookie of the Year Richie Allen and Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. The fans, however, are just as well known for heckling the visiting team. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Burt Hooton's poor performance during game three of the 1977 NLCS[219] has often been attributed to the crowd's taunting.[220] J. D. Drew, the Phillies' first overall draft pick in the amateur draft of 1997, never signed with the Phillies following a contract dispute with the team, instead re-entering the draft the next year to be drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals.[221] Phillies fans were angered over this disrespect and hurled debris, including two D batteries, at Drew during an August 1999 game.[222]\n\n\nMany sportswriters have noted the passionate presence of Phillies fans. Allen Barra wrote that the biggest roar he ever heard from Philadelphia fans was in 1980 when Tug McGraw, in the victory parade after the World Series, told New York fans they could \"take this championship and shove it.\"[223]\n\n\nWhen the Phillies moved to Veterans Stadium, they hired a group of young ladies to serve as ushers. These women wore maroon-colored outfits featuring hot pants and were called the Hot Pants Patrol.[224] The team also introduced a pair of mascots attired in colonial garb, named Philadelphia Phil and Phyllis. In addition to costumed characters, animated Phil and Phyllis figures mounted on the center-field facade would \"hit\" the Liberty Bell after a Phillies home run. This pair of mascots never achieved any significant level of popularity with fans and were eventually discontinued.[224] In 1978, the team introduced a new mascot, the Phillie Phanatic, who has been called \"baseball's best mascot\", which has been much more successful and has become closely associated with the marketing of the team.[225]\n\n\nIn Phillies' fan culture, it is also not unusual to replace an \"f\" with a \"ph\" in words, such as the Phillie Phanatic.[226]\n\n\nThe club surpassed 100 consecutive sellouts on August 19, 2010, selling out over 50% of their home games and averaging an annual attendance of over 3.1\u00a0million fans since moving to Citizens Bank Park;[227] on April 3, 2011, the team broke the three-game series attendance record at the ballpark, having 136,254 fans attend the opening weekend against the Houston Astros.[228]\n\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Phillies led the league in attendance with 3,680,718 and 3,565,718 fans, respectively, coming out to watch Phillies baseball.[229][230][231][232][233]\n\n\nThe Phillies now boast active international support groups on social media, with a Philadelphia Phillies' UK Facebook group starting in August 2015 and UK Phillies' Twitter account created in May 2017.[234][235] In March 2018 a Phillies' France account launched in French.[236]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters\n* List of Philadelphia Phillies first-round draft picks\n* List of Philadelphia Phillies Opening Day starting pitchers\n* List of Philadelphia Phillies seasons\n* Sports in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Dell Technologies Suite Level\". *Phillies.com*.

The team plays its home games at the Wells Fargo Center located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Founded in 1946 and originally known as the **Syracuse Nationals**, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only eight (out of 23) to survive the league's first decade. The team is owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer having owned the team since 2011.\n\n\nThe 76ers have had a prominent history, with many Hall of Fame players having played for the organization, including Dolph Schayes, Hal Greer, Wilt Chamberlain, Chet Walker, Billy Cunningham, George McGinnis, Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Bobby Jones, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, and Allen Iverson. They have won three NBA championships, with their first coming under their previous name, the Syracuse Nationals, in 1955. The second title came in 1967, a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in 1983, won by a team led by Erving and Malone. The 76ers have only been back to the NBA Finals once since then: in 2001, where they were led by Iverson and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. Chamberlain, Erving, Malone, Iverson and Joel Embiid have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the 76ers, for a total of seven MVP awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Philadelphia 76ers\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Together, both men would spend their entire careers with the team. Together the pair won a championship in 1955.\n\n![](image)The 1958\u201359 Syracuse Nationals\nIn 1946, Italian immigrant Danny Biasone established the Syracuse Nationals of the National Basketball League (NBL) in Syracuse, New York, for $5,000.[8] While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns, the Nationals put together a 21\u201323 record, finishing in fourth place. In the playoffs, the Nationals were beaten by the Rochester Royals in four games. In their second season, 1947\u201348, the Nationals struggled, finishing in fifth place with a 24\u201336 record. Despite their record, they made the playoffs, and were swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in three straight games.\n\n\nSeveral teams began to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger was laid. The Nationals \"recipe for success\" began by recruiting Leo Ferris.[9] Staying in the NBL, Ferris signed Al Cervi to be player-coach and outbid the New York Knicks for the services of Dolph Schayes who made his professional debut,[10] leading the Nationals to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40\u201323. In the playoffs the Nationals defeated the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in two straight games. In the semifinals, the Nationals lost to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, when the NBL and the BAA merged into the NBA, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were brought into the NBA.\n\n\nThe Nationals were an instant success in the NBA, winning the Eastern Division in the 1949\u201350 season, with a league-best record of 51\u201313. In the playoffs the Nationals continued to play solid basketball, beating the Philadelphia Warriors in two games. Moving on to the Eastern Finals, the Nationals battled the New York Knickerbockers, beating their big-city rivals in a three-game series. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals faced fellow NBL alums the Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nationals lost just their second home game of the season 68\u201366. The Nationals did not recover, as they fell behind 3\u20131 before falling in six games.\n\n\nDespite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League before the 1950\u201351 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season, 1950\u201351, the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in fourth place with a record of 32\u201334. In the playoffs the Nationals played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the first-place Warriors in two straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91\u201389. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought five-game series, losing the finale by just two points.\n\n\nCervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the 1951\u201352 season by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40\u201326 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals knocked off the Warriors again in a three-game series. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals fell to the Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in four games.\n\n\nThe Nationals finished in second place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952\u201353 season, with a record of 47\u201324. In the playoffs, the Nationals faced the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87\u201381. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals took the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111\u2013105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.[11]\n\n\nThe Nationals acquired Alex Groza, and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953\u201354 season. Once again the Nationals battled for the Division title falling two games short with a 42\u201330 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals won all four games of a round-robin tournament involving the three playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals beat the Celtics in two straight games. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals lost to the Lakers in a hard-fought seven-game series where the two teams alternated wins throughout.\n\n\nWith the NBA struggling financially and down to just 8 teams during the 1954\u201355 season, Nationals owner Biasone suggested the league limit the amount of time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nationals' general manager Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league-wide. In the first season of the shot clock, the Nationals would take first place in the East with a 43\u201329 record. After a first-round bye the Nationals would beat the Celtics in four games to reach the NBA Finals for the second straight season. In the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons.[12] As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3\u20132 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nationals kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109\u2013104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92\u201391 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hal Greer joined the Nationals in 1958 and spent his entire 15-season career with the franchise; he won a championship with the team in 1967.\nComing off their NBA Championship the Nationals struggled during the 1955\u201356 season, needing a tiebreaker over the Knickerbockers to avoid finishing in last place and make the playoffs with a 35\u201337 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals stunned the Celtics winning the first-round series in three games by taking the final two games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals played solid basketball again as they pushed the Warriors to a decisive fifth game. The Nationals' reign as defending champions ended with a 109\u2013104 loss in Philadelphia.\n\n\nThe Nationals got off to a slow start as coach Cervi was fired and replaced by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the 1956\u201357 season in second place with a record of 38\u201334. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics.\n\n\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957\u201358 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. That did not matter on the court as the Nationals held their own finishing in second place with a 41\u201331 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n\nDespite a mediocre 35\u201337 record for the 1958\u201359 season the Nationals made the playoffs again by finishing in third place. In the playoffs, the Nationals swept the Knickerbockers in two straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Celtics, alternating wins before losing by 5 points in Game 7.\n\n\nPlaying in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Celtics, Wilt Chamberlain of the Warriors, Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks and Elgin Baylor of the Lakers, the Nationals held their own posting a solid 45\u201330 record, while finishing in third place after the 1959\u201360 regular season. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost a three-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors.\n\n\nWith the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960\u201361 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38\u201341 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games.\n\n\nSchayes missed 24 games during the 1961\u201362 season and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41\u201339 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121\u2013104 victory.\n\n\nWith an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade; however, with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr, the Nationals remained a strong contender, finishing in second place for the 1962\u201363 season, with a record of 48\u201332. In the playoffs the Nationals faced the Cincinnati Royals, getting off to a 2\u20131 series lead. Needing one win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals lost two straight, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131\u2013127.\n\n\n\n### Relocation to Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Convention Hall, previous home of the Philadelphia Warriors from 1952 to 1962; home of the Sixers from 1963 to 1967\nThe playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963, would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors Irv Kosloff and Ike Richman purchased the team from Danny Biasone and moved the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the Warriors, who had moved to San Francisco. Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".[13][1] The name comes from the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776, although \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing.[14] The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last half-century \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\n\n\nFor their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall, with an occasional game at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).\n\n\n\n### 1964\u20131967: Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain joined the Sixers in 1965 and led the team to the NBA title in 1967.\nIn the 1964\u201365 season, the 76ers acquired the legendary Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors; Chamberlain had been a high school legend at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and began his career with the Warriors while they still played in Philadelphia. The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110\u2013109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer's pass was stolen by John Havlicek, the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship. On December 3, 1965, in the midst of a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.[15]\n\n\n\n#### 1966\u201367: First title in Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nLed by head coach Alex Hannum, the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46\u20134,[16] en route to a record of 68\u201313, the best record in league history at the time.[17] Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, and Greer, along with all-stars Chet Walker, Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"\u2014a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966\u201367 Sixers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration in October 1980.\n\n\n\n### 1967\u20131976: Fall of the 76ers[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1967\u201368 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games.\n\n\nAt the end of the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the 76ers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and general manager Jack Ramsay did not want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. However Chamberlain\u2019s replacement at center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.\n\n\nWhile the rapidly declining 76ers continued to contend for the next three seasons, they never got past the second round. In 1971\u201372, only five years after winning the title, the 76ers finished 30\u201352 and missed postseason play for the first time in franchise history.\n\n\n\n![](image)Billy Cunningham played nine seasons with the Sixers, and would later coach them for eight more seasons.\nThe bottom fell out in the 1972\u201373 season. Ramsay left for the expansion Buffalo Braves, but the Sixers had trouble finding a replacement; Al McGuire and Adolph Rupp turned them down. Kosloff was so desperate for a replacement that he took out an ad in *The Philadelphia Inquirer.* It was answered by Roy Rubin, longtime head coach at Long Island University.[18][19] For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the ABA on the same day Rubin was introduced as head coach. This left the Sixers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and a few months later set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record following the 20-game losing streak was 4\u201358, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9\u201373 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the \"Nine and 73-ers\". Rubin was fired after 51 games and a 4-47 record; as it turned out, it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5\u201326 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. Only six years after tallying the most wins in NBA history, the 1972\u201373 squad notched the fourth-fewest wins in NBA history, and still the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and would remain the lowest until the 2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats finished 7\u201359 for a .106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. The 76ers of 1972\u201373 are generally considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history. In 2007, NBA historian Kyle Wright argued that the 1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks and 1997\u201398 Denver Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers, who won 15 games, were actually poorer teams due to much weaker schedules.[20]\n\n\nThe next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975\u201376 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence.\n\n\n\n### 1976\u20131987: Julius Erving era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Julius Erving played 11 seasons with the 76ers (1976\u20131987), and played in four NBA Finals, ultimately winning in 1983.\nThe Sixers finally came all the way back in 1976\u201377, in large part due to the ABA\u2013NBA merger. The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing a $5 million to the Knicks for \"invading\" the New York area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. So, when the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million\u2014roughly the cost of NBA membership\u2014the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. on May 28, 1976.[21]\n\n\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2\u20130 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers\u2014who were coached by former 76ers' coach/general manager Jack Ramsay\u2014only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\n\n\nThat led to the 1977\u201378 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost 4\u20132. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3\u20133 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden. This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120\u2013106 victory and becoming the third NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading the series 3\u20131. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting \"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), but nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers).[22] The team lost the 1982 Finals in six games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n#### 1982\u201383: Third NBA championship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Moses Malone won MVP honors in 1983, the same year he led the 76ers to their first title in 16 years.\nHarold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981. On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the 1982\u201383 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Led by Hall of Famers Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, and All-Stars Andrew Toney and Bobby Jones, they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"\u2014in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with the minimum 12 games.[*citation needed*] Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") \u2013 a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12\u20131 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000\u201301 Lakers, who went 15\u20131 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016\u20132017 Golden State Warriors, who won the title with a 16\u20131 playoff record. The Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last major-pro championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Arrival of Charles Barkley[edit]\n\n\nAfter a disappointing 1983\u201384 season, which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984\u201385 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways.[24] The Sixers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984\u201385 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54\u201328 record and the second round of the 1986 playoffs, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.\n\n\nOn June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft (which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant) to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson, Jeff Ruland, and Cliff Robinson, none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty.\n\n\nOn the night of the 1986\u201387 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the Sixers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45\u201337 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first-round series that went the distance.\n\n\n\n### 1987\u20131992: Charles Barkley era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Charles Barkley would spend eight seasons with the Sixers.\nIn 1987\u201388, with the team's record at 20\u201323, Guokas was fired and replaced by assistant coach Jim Lynam. Lynam finished the season 16\u201323, to bring Philadelphia's overall mark to 36\u201346. For the first time since the 1974\u201375 season, the Sixers failed to reach the playoffs. Philadelphia selected Charles Smith with its first pick (third overall) in the 1988 NBA draft, then traded his rights to the Los Angeles Clippers for their first pick (sixth overall), and Hersey Hawkins. In five seasons with the 76ers, Hawkins would average 19 points per game, and was the team's all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted and made when he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Dana Barros, Sidney Green and draft picks in 1993.\n\n\nIn 1988\u201389, Philadelphia returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept in the first round by the New York Knicks. In 1989\u201390, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53\u201329 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the 1991\u201392 season, the 76ers went 35\u201347 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.[25]\n\n\n\n### 1992\u20131996: Dark ages[edit]\n\n\nLynam relinquished his head coaching position to become general manager following the 1991\u201392 season, and hired Doug Moe to fill the vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the Sixers posting a 19\u201337 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32\u201376 record at the helm. Following the 1993\u201394 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful as a head coach for the San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42\u2013122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford, players at the end of their careers such as LaSalle Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones\u2014drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers\u2014had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ed Snider purchased the 76ers in 1996.\nStarting with the 1990\u201391 season, and ending with the 1995\u201396 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995\u201396 season, when they finished with an 18\u201364 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.\n\n\nMany 76ers fans call these years \"The Dark Ages\". After many years of misfortune, there was a bright spot. The team won the lottery for the top pick in the 1996 NBA draft. Questions remained, but with the first pick, the Sixers found their \"Answer\": Allen Iverson.\n\n\n\n### 1996\u20132006: Allen Iverson era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of career achievements by Allen Iverson\n\nWith new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the CoreStates Center, things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22\u201360 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996\u201397 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by \"playing the right way\", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997\u201398. Early in the 1997\u201398 season, the Sixers traded Jerry Stackhouse, who had been the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft, to the Detroit Pistons. In exchange, Philadelphia received Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff, defensive standouts who would have an impact in the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, Eric Snow, was added in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics in January 1998.\n\n\nPrior to the 1998\u201399 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28\u201322 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3\u20131, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49\u201333, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the Sixers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where it seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000\u201301.\n\n\n\n#### 2000\u201301 season: NBA Finals loss to the Lakers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iverson won Most Valuable Player honors in 2001 while leading the 76ers to the NBA Finals.\nDuring the 2000\u201301 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41\u201314 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kuko\u010d, and Pepe S\u00e1nchez to Atlanta (S\u00e1nchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56\u201326, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989\u201390 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79\u201378, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back and won the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121\u201388 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88\u201387 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80\u201374. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110\u2013100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34\u201325 second-quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23\u20134 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108\u201391 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11\u20130 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56\u201326 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\n\n\n\n![](image)Larry Brown, who coached the 76ers from 1997 to 2003, was named Coach of the Year in 2001.\nIn Game 1, the Lakers jumped out to an 18\u20135 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94\u201394 tie at the end of regulation before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13\u20132 run for a 107\u2013101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98\u201389. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the Sixers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96\u201391. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100\u201386 win in Game Four and a 108\u201396 victory in Game Five.\n\n\nIn addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000\u201301 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year (Aaron McKie).\n\n\n\n#### Departure of Larry Brown[edit]\n\n\nThe 76ers went into the 2001\u201302 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43\u201339 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3\u20132 by the Boston Celtics. In the 2002\u201303 season, the 76ers sprinted to a 15\u20134 start, but a 10\u201320 swoon left them 25\u201324 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48\u201334, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\n\nOn Memorial Day, 2003, Brown abruptly resigned as head coach, taking over the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers, in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff Van Gundy and Eddie Jordan, the 76ers hired Randy Ayers, an assistant coach under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21\u201331. Chris Ford took over, but the 76ers finished the 2003\u201304 season at 33\u201349, missing the playoffs for the first time in six years. Iverson, who was at odds with Ford throughout the interim coach's tenure, played only 48 games in a stormy, injury-plagued season.\n\n\n\n#### Arrival of Andre Iguodala[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andre Iguodala was drafted by the 76ers in 2004\nFor the 2004\u201305 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings, with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to complement Iverson. Andre Iguodala, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA draft, was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43\u201339 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown.\n\n\nThough in the 2004\u201305 season the 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks, who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. The coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the 2005\u201306 season. A 2\u201310 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38\u201344 record.\n\n\nWith the opening of the 2006\u201307 season, the 76ers started out hot, going 3\u20130 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. They stumbled through the first half of the season and did not recover, finishing 35\u201347, good for third in the Atlantic Division, and ninth in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana).\n\n\nOn December 5, 2006, disappointed with the direction the team was headed, Allen Iverson gave the 76ers management an ultimatum: *find players who will help support me or trade me.* This was confirmed via an in-game interview with team owner, Ed Snider.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2006\u20132011: Post-Iverson era[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**. **Specifically, This section is excessive detailed in comparison to sections of this article of equal, or more, importance**.

Then, on January 11, the 76ers' general manager Billy King announced that the Sixers and aging forward Chris Webber had agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1\u00bd seasons, which is $7 million less than he would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter. The moves allowed the 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned leader of the team, and evaluate whether they saw him as a franchise player. They finished the year 35\u201347.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThaddeus Young was the 76ers' first draft pick in the post-Iverson era.\n![](image)\nElton Brand signed for five years with the Sixers in 2008.\n\nIn 2007, the Sixers drafted small forward Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick. On December 4, 2007, the Sixers fired King and replaced him with Nets' general manager Ed Stefanski.[27]\n\n\nWith Iguodala, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. They were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4\u20132. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the Sixers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on make the playoffs and a 40\u201342 record.\n\n\nOn July 9, 2008, the 76ers signed power forward Elton Brand to a five-year, $79.795 million contract,[28] after trading Rodney Carney[29] and renouncing their rights to all their unrestricted free agents.[30] Brand had originally opted out of his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, looking to re-sign with them.[31] But the 76ers offered him more money (he regarded their offer as the \"Philly-Max\") and a better chance at winning an NBA championship by playing in the Eastern Conference. This move has been the subject of controversy since there were rumors that he and Baron Davis had made a friendly agreement to play together for the Clippers.[32] The team later signed free agent point guard Royal Ivey of the Milwaukee Bucks,[33] Kareem Rush from the Indiana Pacers,[34] and then signed former Sixer Theo Ratliff after Jason Smith's injury. Donyell Marshall was signed on September 2, 2008, after he stated to his agent that he wanted to go back home and end his career in Philadelphia.[35] Rush, Ivey, Ratliff and Marshall were all paid the veteran's minimum salary, but they were to be contributors to a team on the rise. During the off-season, they also re-signed restricted free agents Lou Williams and Andre Iguodala for five years/$25 million[36] and six years/$80 million, respectively.[37]\n\n\nThe Sixers started the year with a 9\u201314 record before firing head coach Maurice Cheeks on December 13. Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo took over and the Sixers gradually improved. They finished the season with a 41\u201341 record, with a 32\u201327 record under DiLeo. Brand's first season with the Sixers ended early with a right shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite the loss of Brand, the Sixers still managed to fight their way into the playoffs. However, they did not find much success, as they were knocked out of the first round by the Orlando Magic; the Sixers had led 2\u20131 after three games, but the Magic won three straight to eliminate the Sixers from the playoffs. It was also during this season that the Sixers played one home game at their old home, the Wachovia Spectrum. The Sixers won 104\u2013101 over the Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009. The game was played to provide the final curtain call on the Spectrum, which was scheduled to be imploded on New Year's Eve 2009.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iverson during his second stint\nFollowing the playoff loss, Tony DiLeo returned to his front office job, creating a head coaching vacancy. Former Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan was introduced as the 76ers' new coach on June 1, 2009.[38] In the 2009 off-season, the Sixers drafted UCLA point guard Jrue Holiday with the 17th pick. The Sixers also traded power forward Reggie Evans to the Toronto Raptors for a three-point specialist, small forward Jason Kapono, who had won back-to-back three-point shootouts in 2007 and 2008.[39] The off-season also marked the return of the 1977\u201397 76ers logo, along with a redesigned court and new uniforms updating the 1980s ones.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Iverson's brief return[edit]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2009, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they had signed Iverson to a one-year prorated $1.3 million non-guaranteed contract.[41] The 76ers were 5\u201313 at the time and had lost Williams for at least 30 games to injury.[42] Iverson made his \"re-debut\" for the 76ers against the team he was traded to, the Denver Nuggets, to a thunderous ovation from the sell-out crowd, scoring 11 points, with six assists and five rebounds.[43] The euphoria that greeted Iverson's return to the 76ers faded quickly. On February 22, Iverson announced he was leaving the 76ers indefinitely to attend to his daughter's illness, and a few weeks later the 76ers announced that Iverson would not return for the rest of the season. The 76ers finished the season with a record of 27\u201355, their first 50-loss season since 1998. Most cited the reason behind this as the players' inability to play within Eddie Jordan's Princeton offense, with several players unhappy with his system. Hours after the 76ers' last game at Orlando on April 14, the team fired Jordan after one season. He was the fourth coach to be fired after one season or less since Larry Brown left the team in 2003.[44]\n\n\n\n### Josh Harris ownership (2011\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Doug Collins was hired by the 76ers as head coach in 2010. He previously played for the team in the 1970s.\nOn May 20, 2010, TNT analyst Doug Collins was named head coach of the 76ers.[45] Collins played for the Sixers for his entire NBA career after being the first overall pick in the 1973 draft, and had previously coached the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and the Washington Wizards. The 76ers had the sixth-best odds at receiving the top pick in the 2010 draft, and they managed to land the second overall pick, beating out the Warriors, Kings, Timberwolves, and Nets, who all had better odds. They used that draft pick to select Ohio State University's Evan Turner.\n\n\nThe Sixers started the season with an uninspiring 3\u201313 mark, but started turning things around, to finish with a 41\u201341 record. They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.\n\n\nOn July 13, 2011, Comcast-Spectacor reached an agreement to sell the 76ers to an investment group led by Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris for $280\u00a0million.[46][47] Other members of the group included David Blitzer, Art Wrubel, Jason Levien, Adam Aron, Martin Geller, David Heller, James Lassiter, Marc Leder, Michael Rubin, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Erick Thohir.[48][49] Harris decided to retain head coach Doug Collins and president of basketball operations Rod Thorn but fired Ed Stefanski, who served as general manager since 2007.\n\n\n\n![](image)Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris led an investment group that purchased the team for $280\u00a0million in 2011.\nFor the season, the Sixers had their best start since 2000\u201301 with a 20\u20139 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. They finished the rest of the season 15\u201322, giving them a 35\u201331 record. Attributed to their lack of a true go-to scorer,[*citation needed*] the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing streak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season.\n\n\nPhiladelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the first-seeded Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4\u20132 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4\u20133. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, given credit for winning the regular season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an effort to re-tool for the upcoming season, The 76ers selected Maurice Harkless, and Arnett Moultrie (via trade with Miami) in the 2012 NBA draft. The Sixers then used their amnesty clause on Brand, traded for Dorell Wright, signed Nick Young, Kwame Brown, and Ivey, and re-signed Spencer Hawes, while Lavoy Allen, Williams, and Jodie Meeks left through free agency. On August 9, 2012, the 76ers agreed to a four-team trade with the Los Angeles Lakers, the Magic, and the Nuggets. In the trade that sent six-time All-Star Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Philadelphia agreed to send 2011 first-round pick Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107, 2012 first-round draft pick Harkless, and a future first-round draft pick to Orlando, as well as All-Star swingman Iguodala to Denver. In exchange, they received Jason Richardson from the Magic and All-Star center Andrew Bynum from the Los Angeles Lakers.[50]\n\n\nThe Sixers started the 2012\u201313 season with high expectations with the help of Bynum and the growth of the young Sixers. Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, in relation to the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the Sixers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on both knees.[51] Bynum was not the only Sixer to suffer through injuries. On February 8, Richardson also went through a season-ending knee surgery.[52] Holiday, Thaddeus Young, Nick Young, and Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Turner and Hawes were the only Sixers to play in every game during the season. The Sixers started the season 12\u20139 but stumbled through a tough stretch and could not recover. The Sixers finished the season 34\u201348, missing the playoffs for the first time since Collins had taken over as head coach.\n\n\nOn April 18, Collins resigned as 76ers coach, citing his declining health and need to spend time with his grandchildren. He stayed with the team as an adviser.[53] Soon after, general manager DiLeo had \"cut ties\" with the team. On May 11, it was announced that Sam Hinkie, who had previously worked for the Houston Rockets, would replace DiLeo as general manager.[54] On July 8, it was announced that Adam Aron had stepped down as CEO and was being replaced by Scott O'Neil.\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132016: \"The Process\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brett Brown as the 76ers' head coach in 2015\nFollowing the 2012\u201313 season, the Sixers, led by Hinkie, chose to shift in the direction of rebuilding the franchise. In an interview, Sixers guard Tony Wroten would refer to the major rebuilding culture surrounding Philadelphia as \"The Process\".[55][56] The first move of this new plan was executed during the 2013 draft, when the Sixers agreed in principle to trade Jrue Holiday and the 42nd pick in the draft, Pierre Jackson, to the New Orleans Pelicans for Nerlens Noel and the Pelicans' 2014 first-round pick. The trade was later made official on July 12.[57] The trade was seen by some[*who?*] as somewhat surprising, as Holiday had been the team's marquee player and was coming off a season that saw him make his first NBA All-Star Game. Additionally, Noel was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered while in college, strongly indicating that he would not be able to make an immediate impact for the Sixers as he would be inactive to start the season. The Sixers used the 11th pick in the draft to select Michael Carter-Williams as Holiday's replacement as the starting point guard. The Sixers chose Arsalan Kazemi with the 54th overall pick, making Kazemi the first Iranian chosen in the NBA draft.[58]\n\n\nFollowing the Holiday trade, many of the team's returning players were either waived or left the team in free agency, most notably Andrew Bynum; of the 15 players on the team's roster during their final game of the 2012\u201313 season, only six remained with the team by January 1, 2014. In their place were a number of young prospects, many coming from the NBA Development League or signing with the Sixers after playing limited roles on other teams. Further moves at the trade deadline on February 20, 2014, saw the exits of veterans Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, and Lavoy Allen, all of whom were key rotational players.\n\n\nThe 76ers had a 3\u20130 start that included wins over the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and a Chicago Bulls team with high expectations. The Sixers struggled heavily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record,[59] and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season.[60] The Sixers finished the season with a 19\u201363 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win\u2013loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Milwaukee Bucks finished worse with a 15\u201367 record.\n\n\nCarter-Williams led all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, joining Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson as the only rookies to accomplish this feat.[61] He also won the player of the week award in his first week, being the second rookie after Shaquille O'Neal to accomplish that.[62] He went on to win the Rookie of the Year award, becoming the first rookie drafted 10th or later to win the award since Mark Jackson in 1987 for the New York Knicks.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were considered to be centerpieces of the Sixers future.\nIn the 2014 NBA draft, the Sixers selected Joel Embiid with the third overall pick and traded with the Orlando Magic for Croatian prospect Dario \u0160ari\u0107, the twelfth pick of the draft. Neither prospect was expected to make an immediate impact for the Sixers, as Embiid was recovering from a stress fracture in the navicular bone, while \u0160ari\u0107 would likely spend one or more years playing in the Turkish Basketball League.[63] In the second round, the Sixers selected K. J. McDaniels, Jerami Grant, Jordan McRae, and Serbian prospect Vasilije Mici\u0107. The Sixers also traded a second-round pick to re-acquire Jackson from the Pelicans.[64]\n\n\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Sixers traded Thaddeus Young to Minnesota in the Kevin Love to Cleveland trade, and received the Heat's 2015 first-round draft pick, Luc Mbah a Moute and Alexey Shved, leaving only two players with three years of experience on the Sixers remaining.\n\n\nOn November 29, 2014, the 76ers lost to the Dallas Mavericks 103\u2013110 and set a franchise record for losses to start the season, as they fell to a record of 0\u201316.[65] After losing their next game against the San Antonio Spurs to make it 0\u201317, the 76ers were on the verge of tying the NBA record of 18 straight losses to start a season if they lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 3, but they broke their losing streak and won their first game of the 2014\u201315 season with an 85\u201377 victory at Minnesota.[66]\n\n\nA new training complex was opened in Camden, New Jersey, in September 2016. In three deals at the 2015 NBA trade deadline, the 76ers traded Carter-Williams and McDaniels for JaVale McGee, Isaiah Canaan, and three draft picks, including a protected 2015 first-round pick originally owned by the Los Angeles Lakers. The Sixers finished the season with an 18\u201364 record, tied with the second-worst in franchise history since 1995\u201396. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win\u2013loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Timberwolves fared worse with a 16\u201366 record and Knicks fared second with 17\u201365 record.\n\n\n\n![](image)Jerry Colangelo joined the team's front office in 2015.\nOn May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, where they selected Duke center Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick. The 76ers also signed JP Tokoto with the 58th overall pick. On November 27, the 76ers lost to the Houston Rockets 116\u2013114, giving them a 27-game losing streak dating back to the previous season, which became the longest losing streak in professional sports. During the same game, the Sixers set a franchise record of 16 three pointers made during the losing effort. On December 1, the 76ers beat the Lakers at home by a score of 103\u201391, but not before setting a league record 28 consecutive losses dating to the 2014\u201315 season. In doing so, the 76ers also managed to avoid setting a new NBA record of most losses to begin a season. They instead tied the old record of 18 losses set by the then-New Jersey Nets in the 2009\u201310 season.[67]\n\n\nOn December 8, the 76ers announced that they would hire Jerry Colangelo, Chairman of the Board of Directors for USA Basketball, as the Special Advisor to the Managing General Partner and Chairman of Basketball Operations.[68] In the first move the team made after hiring Colangelo, they traded two second-round draft picks to the Pelicans in return for point guard Ish Smith.[69] On March 1, 2016, the 76ers, at the time with a record of 8\u201351, missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. The 76ers finished the season 10\u201372.\n\n\n\n#### 2016\u20132020: Colangelo era[edit]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2016, Sam Hinkie resigned by way of a 7,000 word letter of resignation.[70] On April 10, 2016, Bryan Colangelo, the son of Jerry Colangelo, was named president of basketball operations.[71] In the NBA Draft Lottery, the Philadelphia 76ers earned the first pick in the draft, after they had a 25% chance of earning the spot.\n\n\nOn June 23, 2016, following the 2015\u201316 season, and after the 76ers were awarded the first overall pick in the 2016 draft, the team selected LSU Point Forward Ben Simmons first overall. The Sixers also selected French basketball player Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot and Turkish basketball player Furkan Korkmaz with the 24th and 26th picks in the 2016 NBA draft respectively.[72] Many consider the 2016 NBA Draft a turning point for the 76ers after their three seasons of not being competitive resulted in the franchise garnering the first overall pick, the first time the team owned the first since 1996 when the 76ers selected point guard Allen Iverson first overall.[73] The Sixers subsequently traded for another number one pick in the 2017 NBA draft, choosing Markelle Fultz.[74]\n\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season was the most successful season since the 2011\u201312 season as the team finished the regular season in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 52\u201330 winning record and clinched a playoff spot.[75] The season also saw the 76ers reaching a franchise-record 16-game winning streak.[76] In the First Round of the playoffs, the Sixers defeated the Heat in five games, to win their first playoff series since the 2011\u201312 season.\n\n\nFollowing a controversy involving fake Twitter accounts, the 76ers parted ways with general manager Bryan Colangelo on June 7, 2018.[77] The team promoted Elton Brand from executive vice president of basketball operations to fill the vacant general manager role on September 18, 2018.[78]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, the 76ers traded \u0160ari\u0107, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.[79]\n\n\nOn February 6, 2019, the 76ers acquired forward Tobias Harris, as well as Boban Marjanovi\u0107 and Mike Scott, in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, sending Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a protected 2020 first-round pick, Miami's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and Detroit's 2021 and 2023 second-round picks to the Clippers.[80] The 76ers completed the season as the third seed. In the playoffs, they beat the Brooklyn Nets in five games in the first round and faced the second-seeded Toronto Raptors in the second round. The series went to seven games, which the 76ers lost 4\u20133, when Kawhi Leonard made a game-winning buzzer-beater in game 7 in Toronto.\n\n\nIn the off-season, Jimmy Butler left to sign with the Miami Heat in a sign and trade that brought Josh Richardson to Philadelphia. The team also signed Al Horford.\n\n\nOn November 25, 2019, the 76ers made history by signing a sports betting partnership with Fox Bet, the joint venture of online gambling operator The Stars Group and broadcaster Fox Sports. While the NBA has struck a number of partnerships with betting operators following the 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal betting ban, the Fox Bet deal marked the first partnership between a betting operator and an individual NBA team.[81]\n\n\nThe Sixers started off the 2019\u201320 season with an opening day win at home against the rival Boston Celtics. Before the season, they were expected to be another championship contender, as they were in the past two seasons, especially with Kawhi Leonard having left the conference. They had one of the worst away records in the NBA, but their league-best home record, with only 2 losses, kept the team afloat in the playoff race.\n\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the 76ers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[82] The Sixers started the bubble in the sixth seed, tied with the Pacers, who had the tiebreaker. The regular season finished with the 76ers in the sixth seed, a notable decrease in position from the previous two seasons. In the first round of the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated by the Celtics in a 4\u20130 sweep. Head coach Brett Brown was fired on August 24, 2020.\n\n\n\n#### 2020\u2013present: Morey era[edit]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2020, the 76ers hired Doc Rivers as their new head coach.[83] On November 2, the 76ers hired Daryl Morey to be their president of basketball operations.[84] The 76ers went 49\u201323 and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference, capturing the division title for the first time in 20 years. In the opening round, they defeated the Washington Wizards in five games but lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the Conference Semifinals in seven games.[85] Franchise player Joel Embiid, placed second in the voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2020\u201321 regular season behind first-placed winner Nikola Joki\u0107.[86]\n\n\nAfter the Game 7 loss to the Hawks in which Ben Simmons controversially passed on an open dunk to tie the game, Simmons demanded a trade and held out from participating in training camp.[87][88] The 76ers fined Simmons for conduct detrimental to the team, reportedly in excess of $19 million.[89]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2022, the 76ers acquired James Harden and Paul Millsap from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Simmons, Andre Drummond, Seth Curry, and two first-round picks.[90] The 2021\u201322 season finished with a 51\u201331 record, led by Embiid, Harden, and second-year shooting guard Tyrese Maxey. Embiid won the scoring title averaging 30.6 points per game.[91] In a repeat of the previous season's MVP race, Embiid finished second in the 2021\u201322 NBA Most Valuable Player Award contest behind Nikola Joki\u0107.[92]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2022, the 76ers announced 76 Place at Market East, a new 18,600 seat arena to be developed in Center City, Philadelphia.[93]\n\n\n\n## Team identity[edit]\n\n\n* ![Primary logo, 1963 to 1977](image)\n\nPrimary logo, 1963 to 1977\n* ![Primary logo, 1977 to 1996](image)\n\nPrimary logo, 1977 to 1996\n* ![Primary logo, 2009 to 2015](image)\n\nPrimary logo, 2009 to 2015\n* ![Wordmark logo, 2015 to present](image)\n\nWordmark logo, 2015 to present\n\n\n### 1963\u20131978[edit]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers' original logo featured a stylized red \"7\" and blue \"6\" with 13 blue stars above the \"7\" to represent the original 13 American colonies. During this period the franchise employed many uniform changes.\n\n\nThe original uniform featured \"PHILA\" in front and the aforementioned 13 stars encircling the \"76\" on the shorts and the uniform number at the back. Monochrome red letters were emblazoned on either the blue road or white home uniform, and were written in a similar manner as the logo.[94]\n\n\nDuring the 1965\u201366 season, the Sixers experimented with a two-tone design. The home white uniform now had a thick red band across the abdomen, while the road uniform featured red tops and blue shorts. \"PHILA\" was positioned below the uniform number. Players disliked the design and was replaced after only one season.[94][95]\n\n\nThe Sixers unveiled a cleaner design for the 1966\u201367 season, with \"PHILA\" in red block letters and trimmed in either white or blue. \"PHILA\" was also moved back above the number. The logo and stars were removed in favor of simple side stripes. Initially, the Sixers wore blue uniforms on the road, but in 1968, they changed back to red uniforms with \"PHILA\" in white with blue trim.[94][96]\n\n\nFor the 1970\u201371 season, the Sixers tinkered with their red uniforms, switching the color scheme on the letters to blue with white trim. Meanwhile, the white uniform received a more radical makeover, featuring the full name \"Seventy Sixers\" in red cursive lettering with blue trim. This set lasted for only one season.[94][96][97]\n\n\nThe 1971\u201372 season saw the Sixers return to wearing blue uniforms on the road. After sporting \"PHILA\" on the chest for eight seasons, the uniform now read \"Sixers\" in Art Deco style lettering, rendered in white on the road and red at home. Numbers were either white or blue with red trim. Contrasting side stripes were added and extended through the uniform, and either red or white stars were placed on each side. Prior to the 1976\u201377 season, the Sixers tweaked the uniform, now sporting a block \"Sixers\" wordmark and rounded numbers. The following season, the \"Sixers\" wordmark was changed to Bookman Old Style; on both iterations, \"Sixers\" became blue with red trim on the white uniform, with an additional outline on the latter.[94][98]\n\n\n\n### 1978\u20131997[edit]\n\n\nIn 1977, the Sixers logo was tweaked to include a white basketball with blue outlines and the suffix \"-ers\" in blue, completing the team nickname. The following season saw the team go back to basics with their uniforms.\n\n\nStarting with the 1978\u201379 season, the Sixers wore a cleaner uniform design reminiscent of their late 1960s outfits. Side stripes were eliminated and the team logo was emblazoned on the right leg. The road uniform color was changed back to red (with the lettering scheme similar to the 1968\u201370 red uniforms), and the numbers revert to a block letter style.[94][99]\n\n\nBefore the 1991\u201392 season, the Sixers experimented with a more radical uniform design. The front featured a blue wave with red, white and blue stars, and \"Sixers\" in Helvetica was affixed above the blue wave. The full city name \"Philadelphia\" was also added above the team name. The numbers contained drop shadows.[94][100]\n\n\nAfter wearing the graphic-laden design for three seasons, the Sixers changed to a more basic look entering the 1994\u201395 season. The design contained thick blue stripes within either thin red or white stripes, and the letters were changed to a more classic rounded style. Numbers were now rendered in blue on both uniforms with either white or red trim, and the white uniform again featured \"Sixers\" in red letters with white and blue trim.[94][101]\n\n\n\n### 1997\u20132009[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the Sixers drastically changed their logo and colors in an effort to appeal to the more youthful hip-hop-oriented culture. Red, white and blue were retained, but only as trim colors. Instead, the Sixers used black, silver and gold as its core colors, with the logo now featuring 76ers in gold, a single silver star within the 7, and a streaking basketball below the logo.\n\n\nThe black road uniforms remained largely unchanged throughout this span, with the letters in white with red trim. The white home uniform, on the other hand, featured some subtle changes. While the letters were in black with red trim, the \"Sixers\" logo was initially gold, but in 2000, the color was changed as black. Also in 2000, the black background and red outline within the \"Sixers\" logo were removed. A blue alternate uniform was introduced in the same year, with the letters in white with red trim; the arm piping was removed after only one season. All three designs contained a gold star on the neckline, added the alternate \"streaking 76\" logo on the shorts, and featured the \"Sixers\"logo written in the same manner as the logo, with the silver star affixed atop the \"I\".[94][102]\n\n\nIn 2006, the Sixers replaced the blue alternates with a red one, bringing back the \"PHILA\" logo for the first time since 1971. As with the other uniforms, the \"PHILA\" wordmark was shaped similarly to the team logo, with the silver star atop the \"I\". White numbers with black trim were placed on this uniform, along with a silver star on the neckline and blue and white striping. The next season saw some minor tweaks to the black and white uniforms, which now featured the same striping patterns as the red alternate along with the silver star.[94][102]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132015[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, while the previous logo was still in use, the 1977\u201397 Sixers logo was revived to coincide with the team's 60th anniversary (counting the Syracuse years). After that, the team decided to bring back a modern version of said logo, with the addition of a red square and 'Philadelphia' inside a blue rectangle below it, although the partial logo without the square, city name and rectangles was also used.[103]\n\n\nThe white uniform featured \"Sixers\" in blue and numbers in red, both returning to a block letter style. The red uniform contained both the \"Sixers\" and the uniform number in white. In 2011, a blue alternate uniform was introduced, mirroring that of the red uniform. After 2013, the blue uniform became the primary road set. All three designs employed a more subtle striping along the arms and legs.[104][102]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nA new version of the classic 76ers logo was unveiled for the 2015\u201316 season, featuring a slight tilt to the white basketball and a roundel featuring the city name and six stars. A secondary \"Dribbling Ben Franklin\" logo was also introduced.[105]\n\n\nThe home white, away blue and red alternate uniforms featured a mix of classic styles used in previous uniforms. The home white and away blue uniforms featured the 'PHILA' wordmark as homage to the late 1960s uniforms, while the red alternates featured the 'SIXERS' wordmark in tribute to the 1980s uniforms. Side stripes featuring seven stars on one side and six on the other pay homage to the 1970s uniforms, while the shoulder piping was a callback to the 1980s uniforms. The inscription 'PHILA TOUGH' is sewed on the bottom of all uniforms.[106]\n\n\nThe switch to Nike in 2017 saw the Sixers make some slight tweaks to their uniform set. The blue \"Icon\" uniform and the white \"Association\" uniform now feature a red drop shadow on the lettering, and the inscription 'Brotherly Love' replaced 'PHILA TOUGH' near the manufacturer's tag.[107][108] The Sixers also released their new red \"Statement\" uniform, featuring a script \"Sixers\" wordmark, off-centered numbers and blue drop shadows.[109] Prior to the 2019\u201320 season the red uniforms were tweaked to feature a script \"Phila\" wordmark.[110]\n\n\nOn May 16, 2023, the 76ers president of basketball operations, Daryl Morey, announced that Doc Rivers would be dismissed from his position as head coach after three seasons, stating that \"We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.\"[111]\n\n\n\n### City and Earned uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe team's first annual \"City\" uniform features an ornate \"Phila\" lettering, blue numbers with red drop shadows, and other elements inspired from the American Declaration of Independence in 1776.[112] Their second \"City\" uniform, inspired by the 1976 film *Rocky*, shows thirteen stars to represent the Thirteen Colonies. It was based on Rocky because it was from \"'76\".[113]\n\n\nBy virtue of qualifying for the 2018 playoffs, the Sixers were also given an \"Earned\" uniform in the 2018\u201319 season. The Sixers' \"Earned\" uniforms were similar to the *Rocky* \"City\" uniforms, except that the base was white and the lettering and stars were in blue.[114]\n\n\nThe Sixers' \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season paid homage to the Liberty Bell, featuring an ornate \"Philadelphia\" wordmark and red serifed numbers. The gold bell silhouette is prominently featured on the beltline.[115] The 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Allen Iverson era and the Boathouse Row landmark, featuring a black base with red, blue and white accents. The Boathouse Row illustration is drawn in white above \"Philadelphia\" in white with blue drop shadows. The numbers, also in white with blue drop shadows, are placed on the left chest.[116]\n\n\nThe Sixers' \"Earned\" uniform for 2021 (after qualifying in the 2020 playoffs) featured a blue silhouette of the Liberty Bell on a white background, with white numbers placed in the middle.[117]\n\n\nIn commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniforms featured elements of previous uniform designs (a.k.a. \"Mixtape\"). The Sixers' edition featured a navy blue base and red lettering taken from the 1972\u201377 uniforms. Red, orange, green and blue blocks on each side paid tribute to the team's former home, the Spectrum, and also represented fan support for each of Philadelphia's \"Big Four\" teams (red representing the Phillies, orange representing the Flyers, green representing the Eagles, and blue representing the 76ers). The Spectrum center court logo, featuring the arena silhouette at the center, adorned the shorts, and the \"S\" from that logo was placed on the waist.[118]\n\n\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform centered around Philadelphia's Greek translation of the \"City of Brotherly Love\", which was inscribed in front of the uniform. The mostly minimalist style uniform has a white base, red text and striping, and blue trim, and was inspired by the city's love of basketball in all levels.[119]\n\n\n\n## Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Franklin the Dog with a fan at 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend\n### Franklin the Dog[edit]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Franklin the Dog was introduced as the new Philadelphia 76ers mascot to 400 fans and media at The Franklin Institute. After spending the weekend in New York City for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game as the newest NBA mascot, he then was introduced at the Wells Fargo Center in his first game on February 19, 2015.\n\n\nPreviously in the 1980s, the Philadelphia 76ers mascot was Big Shot.[120] He was then replaced with Hip Hop, a rabbit that usually, during time-outs or halftime, would do slam dunks. After the 2011 lockout, Hip Hop would not return.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 76ers\u2013Celtics rivalry\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain being defended by Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics\nThe rivalry between the 76ers and Boston Celtics is the earliest dated rivalry in the NBA. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs, playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve.[121] It is considered to be the second-greatest rivalry in the NBA, next to the Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry.[122] The rivalry first peaked when Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell of the Celtics played each other from 1965 to 1968. The 1966\u201367 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 81-game season (a record since broken by the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous \"Boston's Dead!\" chants.\n\n\nThe 76ers went through a rebuilding period through the early 1970s, and came back to relevance during the 1976\u201377 season, in which they defeated the Celtics en route to a Finals appearance. Both teams would peak in the 1980s, with every single Eastern Conference Championship between 1980 and 1987 belonging to either the 76ers or Celtics. The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 1980s took the fight to the Celtics; neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 1980s, and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 1990s.\n\n\nThe rivalry was reborn in the 2000s. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3\u20132. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4\u20133. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125\u2013124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the 76ers.

The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Lincoln Financial Field in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7]\n\n\nThe franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Since their formation, the Eagles have appeared in the playoffs 29 times, won 16 division titles (including 12 in the NFC East), appeared in four pre-merger NFL Championship Games, winning three of them (1948, 1949, and 1960), and appeared in four Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl LII at the end of the 2017 season.\n\n\nAs of 2023, 13 individuals affiliated with the Eagles have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Chuck Bednarik, Bell, Bob Brown, Harold Carmichael, Brian Dawkins, Sonny Jurgensen, Greasy Neale, Tommy McDonald, Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Dick Vermeil, and Reggie White.\n\n\nThe team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by *Sports Illustrated*,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers dates back to 1933 and is known as the \"Battle of Pennsylvania\".[10]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles rank among the best teams in the NFL for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season.[11][12]\n\n\nThe Eagles are owned by Jeffrey Lurie, who bought the team from previous owner Norman Braman for $195 million on May 6, 1994. As of 2023, the Eagles franchise value has increased to $4.9 billion, according to *Forbes*, making them the 10th-most valuable team in the NFL.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Philadelphia Eagles\n\n### NFL in Philadelphia (1899\u20131931)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Yellow Jackets\n\nThe Frankford Athletic Association was organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club. The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons, the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In spite of winning the NFL championship in 1926, midway through the 1931 season, the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.[14]\n\n\n\n### Bell and Wray era (1933\u20131940)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bert Bell and Lud Wray\n\n![](image)Shibe Park, the Eagles' home field, which they shared with baseball's Phillies in 1940 and then from 1942 to 1957\n![](image)Philadelphia Municipal Stadium, the Eagles' home field from 1936 to 1939 and again in 1941\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the National Football League granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray, who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell\u2013Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly $67,000 USD in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.[15] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies,[15] Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities. Not only was there Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster.\n\n\nIn the 1933 NFL season, the Eagles were one of three teams, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the now defunct Cincinnati Reds, to join the NFL as expansion teams. Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at Penn. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, to begin playing at the Baker Bowl.\n\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York City, and lost the game 56\u20130.[16] The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things.\n\n\nIn 1935, Bell proposed an annual college draft to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent.[17] Between 1927, when the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league, and 1934, three teams, the Chicago Bears, New York Giants, and Green Bay Packers, won all but one title with the exception of the Providence Steam Roller, which won in 1928. By 1936, the Eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. Bell assumed the head coaching position and led the team to a record of 1\u201311, last place in the league.\n\n\nFrom 1936 to 1939, the Eagles played at Municipal Stadium in South Philadelphia. In 1940, Bell balked at a 66% rent increase plus 10% of the gate receipts proposed by the City of Philadelphia for use of Municipal Stadium and signed a lease for Shibe Park, which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954. At Connie Mack Stadium, the Eagles were also able to play night games, since lights were installed at the stadium the year before.[18] In the 1941 season, the Eagles played their home opener at Municipal Stadium, and then moved to Shibe Park.[19][20][21] To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management erected stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20-feet high, these east stands included 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged the park's capacity to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000.[22] The Eagles finished the 1937 season 2\u20138\u20131 and continued to struggle over the next three seasons.\n\n\n\n### Thompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941\u20131969)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Happy Hundred\n\nIn December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson,[23] and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.[24] In a series of events known as the *Pennsylvania Polka*,[23] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.[25] Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.[26] Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Greasy Neale years (1941\u20131950)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1947 NFL Championship Game, 1948 NFL Championship Game, 1949 NFL Championship Game, and Greasy Neale\n\nAfter assuming ownership, Thompson promptly hired Greasy Neale as the team's head coach. During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2\u20138\u20131 record. In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2\u20139.\n\n\n\n##### Steagles (1943)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steagles\n\nFurther information: 1943 Philadelphia Eagles season and 1944 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5\u20134\u20131 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\n\nIn 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history. After two second-place finishes in 1945 and 1946, the team reached the NFL Championship game for the first time in 1947. Van Buren, Pete Pihos, and Bosh Pritchard fought valiantly, but the young team lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28\u201321 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1948)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1948 NFL Championship Game and 1948 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\n![](image)Steve Van Buren, Eagles halfback from 1944 to 1951, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965.\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, Eagles linebacker and center from 1949 to 1962, was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\n![](image)Pete Pihos, Eagles tight end from 1947 to 1955, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1970.\nUndeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game. With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7\u20130. The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown. Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion.\n\n\nPrior to the start of the 1949 season, the Eagles were sold by Thompson to a syndicate of 100 buyers, known as the \"Happy Hundred\", each of whom paid $3,000 for a share of the team. While the leader of the \"Happy Hundred\" was noted Philadelphia businessman James P. Clark, one unsung investor was Leonard Tose.[28]\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1949)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1949 NFL Championship Game\n\nIn 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year. The Eagles were favored by a touchdown,[29][30][31] and won 14\u20130 for their second consecutive title game shutout. Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground.[32] Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL Draft. An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\n\nIn 1950, the Eagles opened the season against the AAFC champion Cleveland Browns, who, along with two other AAFC franchises, had just joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never recovered from the loss, and finished the 1950 season 6\u20136.\n\n\nFollowing the 1950 season, Greasy Neale retired and was replaced by Bo McMillin. Two games into the 1951 season, McMillin was forced to retire following a diagnosis of terminal stomach cancer. Wayne Millner finished out the season before being replaced by Jim Trimble.\n\n\nWhile the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and younger players like Bobby Walston and Sonny Jurgensen occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the total talent necessary for true greatness during most of the 1950s.\n\n\nAfter the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field had a vastly expanded seating capacity for the Eagles. While Connie Mack Stadium had a capacity of 39,000, Franklin Field's capacity was 60,000.[33] In 1969, the grass field at Franklin Field was replaced by AstroTurf, making Franklin Field the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf.\n\n\n\n#### Buck Shaw years (1958\u20131960)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1960 NFL Championship Game and Buck Shaw\n\nIn 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams. During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1960)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1960 NFL Championship Game, Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident, and The Hit (Chuck Bednarik)\n\n![](image)Franklin Field, the Eagles' home field from 1958 to 1970\nThe Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled *They Pay Me to Catch Footballs*, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\nOn November 20, 1960, at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, Bednarik launched a tackle against New York Giants' running back Frank Gifford, which has come to be known as The Hit, a tackle that is routinely ranked as one of the hardest and most vicious hits in NFL history. With the game tied 10 to 10 in the fourth quarter, Gifford caught a short pass over the middle and was immediately hit by Bednarik with a clothes line tackle so hard that it dropped Gifford to the ground unconscious. Gifford was removed from the field on stretcher and transported to a local hospital by ambulance, where he remained for ten days. Gifford was diagnosed with a deep concussion that resulted in his retirement from the game for 18 months.[34] On the 100th anniversary of the NFL's founding, the NFL ranked Bednarik's tackle the 44th greatest play in league history.[35]\n\n\nOn December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game and dealt the formidable Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense. Fittingly, the game ended as Bednarik tackled a struggling Jim Taylor and refused to allow him to stand until the last seconds had ticked away.[36]\n\n\nVan Brocklin came to Philadelphia and agreed to play through 1960 with an understanding that, upon his retirement as a player, he would succeed Shaw as head coach. Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach Nick Skorich instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion Minnesota Vikings. Back-up quarterback Sonny Jurgensen became the Eagles' starter for the 1961 season; they finished a half-game behind the New York Giants for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10\u20134 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil.\n\n\nThe 1962 team, decimated by injury, managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss to the Packers. The off-field chaos continued through 1963, as the 65 shareholders remaining from the original Happy Hundred sold the team to Jerry Wolman, a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club.[37][38]\n\n\nIn 1964, Wolman hired former Cardinals and Washington Redskins coach Joe Kuharich to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons the team failed to make the playoffs and the failures of the team over this period were highlighted by the Santa Claus incident, when fans pelted a Santa Claus with snowballs during a halftime Christmas pageant. The team had only one winning season, in 1966, finishing second in the NFL Eastern Conference. The Eagles lost to the Baltimore Colts 20\u201314, in the post-season's third place consolation game, the Playoff Bowl, which was held at the Orange Bowl in Miami. The Eagles finished 6\u20137\u20131 in 1967. In the following season, the Eagles fell even further in the standings, recording a 2\u201312 record in 1968.\n\n\n\n### Leonard Tose era (1969\u20131984)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Leonard Tose\n\n![](image)Veterans Stadium in South Philadelphia, the Eagles' home field from 1971 to 2002, which they shared with baseball's Phillies\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million,[39] the equivalent of $134\u00a0million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24\u201341\u20131 record during his five-year reign. Tose then named former Eagles wide receiver Pete Retzlaff the team's general manager and Jerry Williams as its new head coach.\n\n\nWith the merger of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East Division with the New York Giants, Washington Redskins, and Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles' heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating back to 1933, and is often cited as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.[8][40][41] 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3\u201310\u20131.\n\n\nIn 1971, the Eagles moved to Veterans Stadium, which had just been constructed and was initially acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering. After a 3\u201310\u20131 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas, and San\u00a0Francisco to open the 1971 season, Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback Norm Snead to the Minnesota Vikings in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman Pete Liske and raw Rick Arrington. Khayat lost his first two games but won six of the season's last nine, thanks largely to the efforts of the Eagles' defense, led by all-pro safety Bill Bradley, who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).\n\n\nThe team regressed in 1972 to finish 2\u201311\u20131, and Khayat was released. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the Kansas City Chiefs (which had had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the Houston Oilers 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker Tom Dempsey. The latter game had been called the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl,\" because the loser, in finishing last in the league, would gain the first overall pick in the 1973 NFL Draft, which was then presumed to be Nebraska wingback Johnny Rodgers, the Heisman Trophy winner. With their loss, the Oilers got first pick and took University of Tampa defensive end John Matuszak, who later faced Philadelphia in Super Bowl XV. With the second overall pick, the Eagles selected USC tight end Charle Young.\n\n\nKhayat was replaced by offensive guru Mike McCormack for the 1973 season. Aided by the skills of quarterback Roman Gabriel and towering young wide receiver Harold Carmichael, they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense.\n\n\nNew general manager Jim Murray also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker Bill Bergey in 1974. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4\u201310 1975 season.\n\n\n\n#### Dick Vermeil years (1976\u20131982)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Miracle at the Meadowlands and Super Bowl XV\n\n![](image)Dick Vermeil, Eagles head coach from 1976 to 1982, led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XV against the Oakland Raiders in 1981.\n![](image)Wilbert Montgomery, Eagles running back from 1977 to 1984, in the 1980 NFC championship game against the Dallas Cowboys at Veterans Stadium\nIn 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the struggling Eagles, who had managed only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.[42] Vermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the Eagles finished 1976 with the same 4\u201310 record as in 1975. In 1977, the first seeds of hope began to emerge. The team obtained hard-throwing quarterback Ron Jaworski in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charle Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator Marion Campbell, began earning a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting in the league.\n\n\n1978 saw one of the great moments in Eagles history, The Miracle at the Meadowlands, when Herman Edwards returned a fumble by Giants' quarterback Joe Pisarcik for a touchdown with 20 seconds left in the game, resulting in a 19\u201317 Eagles victory.[43] The Eagles would edge into the playoffs with a 9\u20137 season. Young running back Wilbert Montgomery became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a season.[44] In 1979, the Eagles tied for first place with an 11\u20135 record, as Montgomery shattered team rushing records with a total of 1,512 yards.\n\n\nIn 1980, the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the Dallas Cowboys, in the NFC Championship Game. The game was played in cold conditions before faithful fans at Veterans Stadium. Led by an outstanding rushing performance by Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is one of the most memorable in Eagles history, and a gutsy game from fullback Leroy Harris, who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in Super Bowl XV with a 20\u20137 victory.[45]\n\n\nThe Eagles traveled to New Orleans for Super Bowl XV, where they were heavily favored over the Oakland Raiders, who had squeaked into the playoffs as a wild-card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with Tose's imprudent decision to bring comedian Don Rickles into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty. The final score was 27\u201310. Journeyman quarterback Jim Plunkett was named the game's MVP.[46]\n\n\nThe team got off to a promising start in the 1981 season by winning their first six games. They ended up 10\u20136 to earn a wild-card berth. However, their hopes to repeat as NFC champs were dashed in the wild-card round by the New York Giants, who won 27\u201321.\n\n\nAfter the Eagles finished 3\u20136 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout\".\n\n\nDefensive coordinator Marion Campbell replaced Vermeil as head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia struggled through the mid-1980s, marked by flagging fan participation. The team failed to make the playoffs in 1983 and 1984. The team nearly moved to Phoenix, Arizona at the end of the 1984 season.[47]\n\n\n\n### Norman Braman era (1985\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Norman Braman\n\nIn 1985, Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65\u00a0million (equal to $184\u00a0million today) to pay off his more than $25\u00a0million ($71\u00a0million today) in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos.[48] The team again struggled during the 1985 season, and Campbell was fired after week 16, to be replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach Fred Bruney for the season's last game.\n\n\nIn the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to the Memphis Showboats' elite pass rusher Reggie White.\n\n\n\n#### Buddy Ryan years (1986\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Body Bag Game, Bounty Bowl, and Buddy Ryan\n\n![](image)Jerome Brown, Eagles defensive end from 1987 to 1991, was named to the 1990 and 1991 Pro Bowl teams before dying in a tragic car accident in June 1992 at age 27.\n![](image)Reggie White's Eagles jersey on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio\nIn 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude sparked team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher attitudes.[49] Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. Randall Cunningham took his place and, despite a 5\u201310\u20131 season, began showing considerable promise. 1987 saw another strike, which shortened the season by one game.[50] The substitutes who had filled in for the strikers performed poorly and were crushed 41\u201322 by the Dallas Cowboys. After the strike, the regular Eagles' 1987 team won a 37\u201320 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7\u20138, of which three games had been played by substitutes.\n\n\nThe Eagles reached the playoffs in 1988, but lost to the Chicago Bears, the team that Ryan had helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator. The game became known as the \"Fog Bowl\", due to the inclement weather during the game. The Eagles lost, 20\u201312.[51]\n\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team never made it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to Eagles fans, as the team was widely regarded as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end Keith Jackson; and running back Keith Byars. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.[52]\n\n\nThe two 1989 matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1\u201315 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson by placing a bounty on their kicker, and by Eagles fans throwing snowballs at him at Veterans Stadium.[53] On November 12, 1990, during a *Monday Night Football* game at the Vet, the Eagles defeated the Washington Redskins by a score of 28\u201314, as the defense scored three of the team's four touchdowns. This game, more lopsided than its score would indicate, was subsequently labeled the Body Bag Game in reference to the number of injuries Eagles players inflicted on the Redskins and the physically tough play of the Eagles in the game. In the game, the Eagles knocked out the starting Washington quarterback, and then seriously injured his replacement. Running back Brian Mitchell, who would later be signed by the Eagles, was called upon to finish the game as the Redskins' quarterback.[54] Washington returned to Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs to defeat the Eagles 20\u20136, ending their season.\n\n\nRyan was fired on January 7, 1991 and was replaced by offensive coordinator Rich Kotite.[55] The team started the 1991 season with the loss of starting quarterback Randall Cunningham due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback Jim McMahon assumed the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top-rated defense in the league, the team failed to make the playoffs by finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10\u20136.\n\n\nOn June 25, 1992, All Pro defensive tackle Jerome Brown was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base dedicated the 1992 season to \"bring it home for Jerome\".[56] The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11\u20135 record to earn a wild-card playoff spot. Kotite led the Eagles to a victory over the New Orleans Saints in the wild-card game but then fell to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. Another blow to the team was the loss of all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season.\n\n\nAmong the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback Randall Cunningham, tight end Keith Jackson, and running back Herschel Walker. But what was known as the Gang Green defense, led by Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner, Wes Hopkins, Mike Golic, Byron Evans, Eric Allen, Andre Waters, and Mark McMillian, defined the team. In 1993, Kotite's Eagles fell apart after a promising start and miss the playoffs, ending the regular season 8\u20138.\n\n\n\n### Jeffrey Lurie era (1994\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jeffrey Lurie\n\nBy 1994, team owner Norman Braman had become largely unpopular among local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185\u00a0million. The club is now estimated to be the 21st most valuable sports team, worth $3.4\u00a0billion, as evaluated in 2021 by *Forbes*.[57]\n\n\nIn Lurie's first season as owner in 1994, the team went 7\u20139 and again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and replaced by San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes, who successfully lured 49ers star Ricky Watters to join the team as a free agent.\n\n\nIn 1995, Rhodes's first season, the Eagles got off to a slow start by losing three of their first four games but subsequently rebounded to finish with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles, playing at home, overwhelmed the Detroit Lions 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter. However, the Eagles were again eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys by a score of 30\u201311. This would be Randall Cunningham's last game as an Eagle. Cunningham scored the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years.\n\n\n1995 marked the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of Rodney Peete, leading to friction between the two. Earlier, rumors had circulated that Lurie and Rhodes had tried to trade Cunningham to the Arizona Cardinals. However, no such trade materialized and Cunningham retired shortly after the season.\n\n\nIn 1996, the Eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic kelly green to a darker midnight green. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a week-5 Monday night game at Veterans Stadium against the rival Cowboys witnessed a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by Ty Detmer and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the 49ers) in the playoffs. In the 1996 NFL draft, future fan-favorite and hall-of-famer Brian Dawkins was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led fans and local media to cast blame on high-priced free agents (Irving Fryar, Watters, Troy Vincent, and Guy McIntyre) for not stepping up in big games, especially in the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.[58]\n\n\nAfter a see-saw 6\u20139\u20131 campaign in 1997, the bottom fell out in 1998. The Eagles suffered a 3\u201313 record, their worst since 1972, and were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics. Home attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt, and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterback coach Andy Reid as head coach.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Andy Reid years (1999\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Andy Reid, Super Bowl XXXIX, and Miracle at the New Meadowlands\n\n![](image)Andy Reid, Eagles head coach from 1999 to 2012, led the Eagles to Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots in 2004.\n![](image)Brian Dawkins, Eagles safety from 1996 to 2008, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018\n![](image)Donovan McNabb, Eagles quarterback from 1999 to 2009 and Andy Reid's first draft selection as Eagles head coach in the 1999 NFL Draft\n![](image)DeSean Jackson played for the Eagles from 2008 to 2013 and then again from 2019 to 2020; his December 19, 2010, punt return against the New York Giants, known as the Miracle at the New Meadowlands, is considered one of the greatest plays in NFL history.[60]\n![](image)LeSean McCoy, Eagles running back from 2009 to 2014\n![](image)Fletcher Cox, Eagles defensive tackle since 2012\nThe Eagles reemerged as a predominant NFL team under the leadership of new head coach Andy Reid, who was hired away from the Green Bay Packers, where he was the Packers' quarterback coach. Reid's first notable step was drafting Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft. The Eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the Eagle to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted Cleveland Browns. Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans. The drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year.\n\n\nThe 1999 season was largely a rebuilding year for the Eagles, who won only five games. The team, which routinely sells out its home games in Philadelphia, had two 1999 home games that failed to sell out, resulting in local TV blackouts. Another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare Philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game. \n\n\nThe Week 5 home game at Veterans Stadium on October 10, 1999 against the Dallas Cowboys represented the last play of Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin's career. In the game, Irvin was driven into the turf by Eagles safety Tim Hauck, which left Irvin lying motionless. Some Eagles fans responded with applause, giving further rise to Philadelphia's reputation as unduly aggressive and hostile fans. Irvin was transported from the field by stretcher and then by ambulance to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Irvin, who was diagnosed with a potentially threatening cervical spine injury and forced to announce his NFL retirement after the injury, later said the Philadelphia fans were applauding his departure rather than his serious injury.[61] The team finished the season with a record of 5\u201311.\n\n\nThe 2000 regular-season opener in Dallas on September 3 became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\". Kickoff temperature in Texas Stadium was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set in a 1997 Cowboys\u2013Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had prepared for the predicted heat by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved successful as the Eagles won 44\u201314 while multiple Cowboys players had been consigned to the bench, unable to handle the torrid climate while the Eagles had no players benched. The game was also significant as marking the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East. The team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the playoffs as a wild card, which restored fan optimism. After brushing aside the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21\u20133, the Eagles moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose 20\u201310 to the New York Giants. After compiling an 11\u20135 record in 2001, the Eagles reached the playoffs again, this time at the top of their division. In a near rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the Buccaneers in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the Bears 33\u201319 at Soldier Field. In the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the St. Louis Rams, who defeated them 29\u201324.\n\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the Eagles to a 12\u20134 season in 2002. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship game, but lost at home 27\u201310 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the last game at Veterans Stadium.\n\n\nIn the opening game of the 2003 season, the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first regular-season game ever played at their new home, Lincoln Financial Field. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season and then reached the conference championship game. In doing so, the Eagles became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown receptions all year by their wide receivers, which tied the league-low since the regular-season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the New York Giants' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch; the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Eagles beat the Green Bay Packers 20\u201317 in overtime thanks in part to a late-game completion from McNabb to Freddie Mitchell on an iconic play that has come to be known as 4th and 26. They lost the NFC Championship game to the Carolina Panthers 14\u20133. Panthers cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. had three interceptions in the game.[62]\n\n\nThe Eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver Terrell Owens, and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers, on March 16, 2004.[63] The 2004 season began with a bang as Owens caught three touchdown passes from McNabb in their season opener against the New York Giants. Owens ended up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury in a December 19 game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles' 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row. The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1997 San Francisco 49ers. Their final two regular-season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost both, yet still finished the season with a 13\u20133 record. McNabb had his best season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded Minnesota Vikings. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), Brian Westbrook dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and Freddie Mitchell performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the Atlanta Falcons, McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27\u201310, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they faced the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14\u201314 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left sealed their fate, as the Patriots won 24\u201321.\n\n\nThe team took a step back in 2005 with a 6\u201310 record, failing to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1999 season. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4\u20132 then losing three in a row, before he finally succumbed to injury and missed the rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games and was eventually cut.\n\n\nIn 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil. However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10\u20136 record. They won the Wild Card game against the New York Giants, but lost in the Divisional Round to the New Orleans Saints. The 2007 season would end with the Eagles finishing 8\u20138 and failing to make the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. However in 2008, the team finished the season with a 9-6-1 record, making the playoffs with a wild card berth, The team upset the Minnesota Vikings in the first round, winning the game 26-14. The team then went on to defeat the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 23\u201311 en route to their sixth NFC Championship Game. In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles rallied from down 24\u20136 at halftime to up 25\u201324 in the fourth quarter, but they lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 32\u201325 after quarterback Kurt Warner scored a touchdown with just under three minutes remaining in regulation.\n\n\nEntering the 2009 season, the Eagles signed quarterback Michael Vick.[64] On December 6, 2009, Andy Reid became only the fifth coach in NFL history to win 100 or more games with a single team in a single decade (the other four are Tom Landry, Don Shula, Tony Dungy, and Bill Belichick.[65] McNabb finally had a complete receiving corps, between first-round draft pick Jeremy Maclin, DeSean Jackson's 1,000-yard season, and Brent Celek ranking among the top 5 tight ends in the league. Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end Trent Cole stepped up and became the dominant force on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5\u20134, then won six straight. After a shutout by the Dallas Cowboys in week 17, the Eagles failed to secure a first-round bye, and with a record of 11\u20135, they were the NFC's sixth seed. In their January 2010 wild card game, the Eagles played against their divisional foes for the second consecutive week, losing 34\u201314 to hand Dallas their first playoff win since December 1996.\n\n\nOn January 11, 2010, General Manager Tom Heckert, Jr. was hired away by the Cleveland Browns; he was replaced by Howie Roseman, who was promoted from Vice President of Player Personnel. On March 5, 2010, Brian Westbrook was cut from the Eagles after eight seasons with the team. On April 4, 2010, the team traded long-time starting quarterback Donovan McNabb to the Washington Redskins in exchange for a second-round draft pick.[66] Kevin Kolb was immediately named the starter for the 2010 season, but after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Packers, Vick took over as the starter. Week 4 saw the return of McNabb to Philadelphia. The Redskins got a touchdown early in the first quarter. After that, both offenses sputtered and the Eagles had to settle for two field goals. But things rapidly fell apart when Vick injured his ribs and chest late in the first quarter when two Redskins defensive backs crushed him from both sides while running near the end zone. Kolb was once again brought out to play, but delivered an uninspiring performance. He managed a touchdown pass in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough. A two-point conversion attempt after the touchdown failed, and Washington won 16\u201312. In Week 15, the Eagles beat New York in a stunning upset by overcoming a 21-point deficit in the second half. In the closing seconds of the game, DeSean Jackson returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown to win 38\u201331. This became known as the Miracle at the New Meadowlands.[67] Vick led the Eagles to their sixth NFC East division title in ten seasons. With a record of 10\u20136, the Eagles clinched the third seed. In the wild card round, the Eagles lost 21\u201316 to the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers.\n\n\nThe 2011 season for the Eagles was a major disappointment. The off-season was marred by a lockout that began in March after the NFL's collective bargaining agreement expired, making practices, trades, and free agency impossible. During the draft, the Eagles did comparatively little. After the lockout ended in July, the team embarked on a rash of high-profile FA signings, including Raiders CB Nnamdi Asomugha, Dolphins RB Ronnie Brown, Giants WR Steve Smith, Packers TE Donald Lee, Titans DE Jason Babin, and Packers DT Cullen Jenkins. Meanwhile, Kevin Kolb, displeased at losing the starting quarterback job to Michael Vick in 2010, was traded to Arizona for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Replacing him as 2nd-stringer was ex-Titans quarterback Vince Young. Young created a lot of hype by calling Philadelphia the \"Dream Team\".[68] The team managed to finish only 8\u20138 and missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn 2012, the Eagles started off winning three of their first four games but lost their next eight, which eliminated them from the playoff hunt. They won only one of their last four games. After a loss to the New York Giants on December 30, 2012, head coach Andy Reid was fired after fourteen seasons with the team.[69]\n\n\n\n#### Chip Kelly years (2013\u20132015)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zach Ertz, Eagles tight end from 2013 to 2021\nOn January 16, 2013, after a 4\u201312 season, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach.[70] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick the starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's fast-paced spread offense. The 2013 season proved very successful for the Eagles. While a hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1\u20133 start, his backup Nick Foles led the team to a 10\u20136 regular-season record and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles had thrown 19 touchdowns, just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game, with seven, against the Oakland Raiders, which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third-highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season-high set back in 1948. Following the 2013 season, the Eagles released Pro-Bowl wide receiver DeSean Jackson due to his poor \"work ethic and attitude\", as well as speculation of his involvement in gang-related activities.[71] The team signed All Pro safety Malcolm Jenkins to a three-year contract, worth $16.25 million.\n\n\nThe Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games and come back to win.[72] Nick Foles struggled with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6\u20132 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his replacement by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles. The Eagles held the divisional title from Week 1 to Week 15. After going 9\u20133 with a crucial win over Dallas, the Eagles lost their next three, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3\u201311 Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\nFollowing the 2014 season, Chip Kelly was given total control and made some controversial personnel moves. He traded LeSean McCoy, who had become the team's all-time leading rusher after the 2014 season, for linebacker Kiko Alonso, a player Kelly coached at Oregon who had missed the entire 2014 season.[73] He also cut ten-year veteran and starter Trent Cole, who was still a consistent threat on defense and was second only to legend Reggie White on the Eagles all-time sack list.[74] He also traded the highly successful Nick Foles for Sam Bradford, who had missed the entire 2014 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.[75] Kelly tried to re-sign Jeremy Maclin, who had stepped up as the team's leading wide receiver, but Maclin signed with the Kansas City Chiefs instead. However, the Eagles also acquired league leading rusher DeMarco Murray,[76] which not only helped the Eagles, but hurt their rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. They also obtained Super Bowl champion Byron Maxwell,[77] who left the Seattle Seahawks in free agency to sign a six-year, $63 million contract. The first two games of the 2015 season were dismal, as they lost both. Bradford had a poor 2\u20134 TD-INT ratio, Maxwell was constantly beaten by Falcons receiver Julio Jones, and Murray was held to 11 yards on 21 carries. After Murray was injured, Ryan Mathews rushed for over 100 yards in a Week 3 win against the New York Jets. Kelly made Murray the unquestioned starter and although Murray's play improved over the season, he never regained his dominant form and was held to a career-low average of 3.6 yards per carry.\n\n\nOn December 29, 2015, with one game left in the season, head coach Chip Kelly was released by the Eagles after a 6\u20139 record. Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur was named interim head coach for the final game against the rival New York Giants, which Shurmur won 35\u201330.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Doug Pederson years (2016\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl LII, Philly Special, and Double Doink\n\n![](image)Doug Pederson, Eagles head coach from 2016 to 2020, led the team to its first Super Bowl win on February 4, 2018, in Super Bowl LII.\nThe Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016. Pederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after having spent the four seasons before those with the Eagles. He served as a quality control assistant coach for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He had been praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the prior several seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense.[79][80]\n\n\nAt the end of the 2015 season, the Eagles were slated for the 13th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. They traded that pick, Byron Maxwell, and Kiko Alonso to the Miami Dolphins for the eighth overall pick. Later, they traded the eighth overall pick, their third- and fourth-round picks, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2018 second-round pick to the Cleveland Browns for the second overall pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick. They used the second overall pick to draft North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz. On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season, for a 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick. Following the trade, the Eagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season.[81]\n\n\nFirst-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3\u20130 record to start the season. His rookie quarterback started with five touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. After a Week 4 bye, they lost four out of the next five games, including losses to every team in their division. They also lost right tackle Lane Johnson to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss against the Lions, which damaged Carson Wentz's hot start. In those four defeats, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points.[82] Pederson and the Eagles won just three of their final seven games. Although Wentz started off the season well, he finished with a TD\u2013INT ratio of 8:7. The rookie head coach-quarterback tandem led the Eagles to a 7\u20139 record, finishing last in the division.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl LII champions (2017)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Super Bowl LII\n\nSee also: Curse of Billy Penn and Philly Special\n\n![](image)Nick Foles, Eagles quarterback from 2012 to 2014 and from 2017 to 2018, was Super Bowl LII's Most Valuable Player.\n![](image)Jason Kelce, Eagles center since 2011, at the championship parade in Philadelphia on February 8, 2018\n![](image)Malcolm Jenkins, Eagles safety from 2014 to 2019, holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy at the Eagles' February 2018 Super Bowl LII parade in Center City Philadelphia.\nThe Eagles had a 13\u20133 record in 2017, including a nine-game winning streak. In a week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback Carson Wentz left the game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and backup Nick Foles, who had been re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season. Foles's first start was a comeback from a 20\u20137 deficit against the New York Giants where he scored four touchdowns to win 34\u201329. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games. Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16. Foles led the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15\u201310. In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings 38\u20137, despite having been betting underdogs. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns. The Eagles traveled to Minneapolis to compete in Super Bowl LII, their third attempt at a title, against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 2005.\n\n\nWith Foles at the helm, the game's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles in just three plays: a short pass from Foles to Nelson Agholor, a 36-yard run up the middle by LeGarrette Blount, and a 34-yard touchdown pass from Foles to Alshon Jeffery on the left side of the field. The ensuing extra-point attempt from Elliott was missed wide right, which made the score 9\u20133 in favor of the Eagles. The Patriots responded by advancing the ball to the Philadelphia 11-yard line on their next drive, which was set up by a 50-yard completion from Brady to Danny Amendola, and the quarter ended.[83]\n\n\nIn the second quarter, Philadelphia faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line with 38 seconds left. Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a trick play similar to one that had failed for the Patriots earlier. It would be the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots. The scoring play came to be known as the Philly Special.[83] New England's only lead was by one point in the fourth quarter, 33\u201332, but the Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz to take the lead. The last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by Jake Elliott to make the final score 41\u201333.\n\n\nThe Eagles won their first Super Bowl and Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years. Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.[84] The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.[85]\n\n\nThe game set many other Super Bowl records as well, including fewest punts from both teams (one), and most yards gained by a team (613 for New England).[86]\n\n\nBefore the 2018 season started, many injuries plagued the team, including quarterback Carson Wentz, who was still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that he had sustained during the previous season. Nick Foles was named the starting quarterback to begin the season,[87] and helped the team win their opening game against the Atlanta Falcons, 18\u201312. Wentz returned as the starting quarterback in week 3 after Foles had led the team to a 1\u20131 record.[88] Injuries continued to be a major problem throughout the season, especially on defense as Jalen Mills, Ronald Darby, and Rodney McLeod all suffered season-ending injuries.[89][90][91] Wentz suffered a fractured vertebra in his back after a week 14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys,[92] and Foles was again named the starter for remainder of the season.[93] The Eagles' 4\u20136 record after 10 games seemed to give them little chance of making the playoffs, but the team managed to win 5 of their last 6, including upsets over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans. The Eagles finished the season with a 9\u20137 record and made the playoffs as the sixth seed.\n\n\nIn the Wild Card game against the Chicago Bears, Foles threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a 16\u201315 win. With ten seconds left, Bears kicker Cody Parkey missed a potential game-winning field goal that became known in NFL lore as the Double Doink. This sent the Philadelphia Eagles to an NFC Divisional matchup against the New Orleans Saints. The Eagles offense initially performed well, ending the first quarter with a 14\u20130 lead. The Eagles would not score again after the Saints defense rallied, forcing Foles to throw two interceptions. The Eagles ended up losing by a score of 20\u201314, ending their opportunity to repeat as Super Bowl champions.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Eagles matched their 9\u20137 record from 2018. They won 4 straight games against divisional opponents to close the season, clinching the NFC East in Week 17 with a 34\u201317 win over the New York Giants[94] and clinched a playoff berth for the third consecutive season. Carson Wentz started his first playoff game in the Wild Card round against the Seattle Seahawks, but left the game early in the first quarter after suffering a concussion on a controversial helmet-to-helmet hit by Jadeveon Clowney.[95] Backup quarterback Josh McCown finished the game even after suffering a torn hamstring in the second quarter.[96] The Eagles lost to the Seahawks 17\u20139, ending their season.[97]\n\n\nThe Eagles opened the 2020 season with consecutive losses to the Washington Football Team and Los Angeles Rams. In week 3, the Eagles tied with the Cincinnati Bengals after controversially punting the ball instead of attempting a potential 64-yard game-winning field goal late in overtime.[98] The decision was widely criticized by sports media and fans as they accused head coach Doug Pederson of settling for a tie, rather than playing to win.[99] Once again, injuries continued to plague the team as almost every offensive starter had suffered an injury throughout the season,[100] and the team fielded 14 different offensive line combinations in 16 games.[101] The team entered the bye week with a 3\u20134\u20131 record and proceeded to lose their next four games. During their week 13 match-up against the Green Bay Packers, rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts entered the game in the third quarter in relief of Wentz after poor play.[102] Hurts would later be named the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after a career-worst season performance by Wentz.[103][104] Hurts led the Eagles to a 24\u201321 victory against the New Orleans Saints in week 14. This would be the team's last win of the 2020 season as they lost their next three games, finishing with a 4\u201311\u20131 record and missing the playoffs for the first time in four seasons.\n\n\nDuring the 2020 off-season, defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz announced that he would step down from his position.[105] A day later, linebackers coach Ken Flajole left his position on the team.[106] After a disappointing 2020 season, Doug Pederson met with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie to discuss the future of the team. Pederson proposed changes to the coaching staff that were described by internal reporters as \"underwhelming\" and out of line with Lurie's vision for the team.[107][108]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2021, the Eagles announced that they had fired Pederson.[109] In a statement, Lurie described the move as in the best interests of both Pederson and the team.[110] Pederson became just the first head coach to be fired within three years of winning a Super Bowl since the Baltimore Colts fired Don McCafferty after the 1972 NFL season.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Nick Sirianni years (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl LVII\n\n![](image)Jalen Hurts, Eagles quarterback since 2020\nThe Eagles hired former Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni as their next head coach on January 21, 2021.[112] During the offseason, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Carson Wentz to the Colts for a 2021 third-round draft pick and a 2022 conditional second-round pick.[113] In doing so, Wentz was reunited with Frank Reich, head coach of the Colts who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two years in Philadelphia, including during their Super Bowl\u2013winning season in 2017. The Eagles absorbed a $33.8-million dead-cap hit for trading Wentz.[114]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 NFL Draft, the Eagles selected Heisman Trophy\u2013winning wide receiver DeVonta Smith with the 10th overall pick,[115] and maneuvered around the draft to gain an extra first-round selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.[116] Smith was a highly touted prospect out of the University of Alabama, and was the first Heisman winner the Eagles drafted in over fifty years.[117] The drafting of Smith also reunited him with Jalen Hurts, his first quarterback at Alabama.\n\n\nAfter training camp, Hurts was officially named the Eagles' starting quarterback for the 2021 season by head coach Sirianni. After starting the season 2\u20135, the Eagles went 7\u20133 in their last ten games, clinching a playoff berth in week 17 after a victory over the Washington Football Team along with a loss by the Minnesota Vikings and win by the San Francisco 49ers.[118] The Eagles finished the season with the #1 rushing offense; It was the best rushing offense since the 1985 Chicago Bears, and the best in the franchise history since the 1949 Eagles team. They lost in the wild card game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31\u201315.[119]\n\n\nThe Eagles went on to win their first eight games of the 2022 season, and earned the top seed in the NFC with a 14\u20133 overall record.[120] They went on to beat the Giants 38\u20137 in the Divisional round, followed by a 31\u20137 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game, earning them their fourth Super Bowl appearance.[121] However, despite erasing a late 8-point deficit, they ultimately lost on a late field goal to the Kansas City Chiefs, 38\u201335.[122]\n\n\n\n## Championships[edit]\n\n\n### NFL championships (pre-Super Bowl era)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1948 | Greasy Neale | Shibe Park (Philadelphia) | Chicago Cardinals | 7\u20130 | 9\u20132\u20131\n |\n| 1949 | Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (Los Angeles) | Los Angeles Rams | 14\u20130 | 11\u20131\n |\n| 1960 | Buck Shaw | Franklin Field (Philadelphia) | Green Bay Packers | 17\u201313 | 10\u20132\n |\n| **Total NFL Championships won: 3** |  |\n\n\n### Super Bowl championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | LII | U.S. Bank Stadium (Minneapolis) | New England Patriots | 41\u201333 | 13\u20133\n |\n| **Total Super Bowls won: 1** |  |\n\n\n### NFC championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | Veterans Stadium (Philadelphia) | Dallas Cowboys | 20\u20137\n |\n| 2004 | Andy Reid | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Atlanta Falcons | 27\u201310\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Minnesota Vikings | 38\u20137\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | San Francisco 49ers | 31\u20137\n |\n| **Total NFC Championships won: 4** |  |\n\n\n### Division championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\n\nIn 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look. Both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996, when the primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-like style, and the lettering changed from calligraphic to block letters.[125] The eagle head is the only NFL logo to \u201cface left\u201d which causes the right side of the logo to present a stylized \u201cE\u201d.\n\n\nSince 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after a bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular-season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th-anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \"throwback\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.[126]\n\n\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[127] In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\n\nFor the 2012 season, Nike took over from Reebok as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\n\n\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\n\n\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the NFL Color Rush program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the New England Patriots, after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\n\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\n\n\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the Carolina Panthers. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\n\n\nDuring Week 10 of the 2021 season, the Eagles paired their white uniforms with the alternate black pants against the Denver Broncos, marking the first time the black pants were paired with a different colored uniform.\n\n\nIn 2022, the Eagles unveiled a new black alternate helmet, which would be worn alongside the all-black uniform. In addition, the team announced that throwback Kelly Green uniforms would return as an alternate uniform starting in the 2023 season.[128] The team originally intended to release the uniforms in 2022, but due to production supply issues, the Eagles elected to delay its release to 2023, with the Kelly Green helmet most likely supplanting the black helmet barring any changes to the NFL's alternate helmet rule.\n\n\nOn June 16, it was released to the media that the Eagles would be changing their wordmark to a more modernized design. The new wordmark would replace the old design immediately however would not be placed on the Team's Jerseys until the 2024 season.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Dallas Cowboys[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry\n\nSee also: Bounty Bowl\n\nThe Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL.[129][130] The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 73\u201355 as of the 2022 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006. There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into Draft Weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe Eagles' rivalry with the New York Giants began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball's Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry and the NHL's Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry. It is ranked by NFL Network as one of the greatest rivalries of all time,[133] *Sports Illustrated* ranks it as the fourth best NFL rivalry of all time,[8] and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the football community.[134] The Eagles lead the all-time series 93\u201388\u20132 after the 2022 NFL season.\n\n\n\n### Washington Commanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Commanders\u2013Eagles rivalry\n\nSee also: Body Bag Game\n\nWhile not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins and Washington Commanders has still been fierce. Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles' inaugural 1933 season, their first meeting did not take place until October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6\u20130 at Fenway Park. Washington currently leads the all-time series 89\u201384\u20136. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall with the Eagles winning 16 of the last 27 matchups.[135]\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry\n\nThe Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35-13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49\u201329\u20133.\n\n\n\n### Atlanta Falcons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles\u2013Falcons rivalry\n\nThe Eagles lead the Atlanta Falcons 21\u201315\u20131, with a 3\u20131 lead in playoff games. The rivalry first emerged after the Falcons upset the Eagles in the 1978 Wild Card Round, and only intensified further during the 2000s thanks to the rivalry between prominent dual-threat quarterbacks Donovan McNabb and Michael Vick. Recently, the Eagles' path to winning Super Bowl LII included a 2017 divisional round victory over the Falcons.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nThough not as famous or historic, there have been talks of an emerging rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. The two teams have played each other 36 times (including 2 postseason games), with the Philadelphia Eagles winning 15 games, the San Francisco 49ers winning 20 games, and tying 1 time;[138] those games were often highly competitive. The rivalry really emerged with the 2023 NFC Championship game where the Eagles routed a 49ers team dealing with numerous injuries (namely to all their quarterbacks) despite having a mostly healthy top-ranked defense and becoming physically aggressive towards their opponent, allowing the Eagles to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl. Since that game, 49ers players and fans have shared their frustrations, igniting what many see as a new rivalry.[139]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Philadelphia Eagles players\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Philadelphia Eagles roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| **Quarterbacks*** 13 Will Grier\n* 1 Jalen Hurts\n* 16 Tanner McKee\n* 7 Kenny Pickett\n\n**Running backs**\n* 26 Saquon Barkley\n* 35 Tyrion Davis-Price\n* 14 Kenneth Gainwell\n* 36 *Kendall Milton*\n* 38 Lew Nichols III\n* 39 *Will Shipley*\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 11 A.

By 2012, the Honor Roll had been retitled as the Eagles Hall of Fame.[144] Players are considered for induction three years after their retirement from the NFL, and there have been 47 inductees into the Eagles Hall of Fame as of 2019.[145]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Eagles Hall of Fame** |\n| Year\n | No.\n | Name\n | Position(s)\n | Tenure\n |\n| 1987 | 60 | Chuck Bednarik | C\u2013LB | 1949\u20131962\n |\n| \u2014 | Bert Bell | Founder-Owner | 1933\u20131940\n |\n| 17 | Harold Carmichael | WR | 1971\u20131983\n |\n| 56 | Bill Hewitt | TE\u2013DE | 1936\u20131939, 1943\n |\n| 9 | Sonny Jurgensen | QB | 1957\u20131963\n |\n| 33 | Ollie Matson | RB | 1964\u20131966\n |\n| 31 | Wilbert Montgomery | RB | 1977\u20131984\n |\n| \u2014 | Earle \"Greasy\" Neale | Head coach | 1941\u20131950\n |\n| 35 | Pete Pihos | TE\u2013DE | 1947\u20131955\n |\n| 54 | Jim Ringo | C | 1964\u20131967\n |\n| 11 | Norm Van Brocklin | QB | 1958\u20131960\n |\n| 15 | Steve Van Buren | HB | 1944\u20131951\n |\n| 53 | Alex Wojciechowicz | C\u2013DT | 1946\u20131950\n |\n| 1988 | 66 | Bill Bergey | LB | 1974\u20131980\n |\n| 25 | Tommy McDonald | WR | 1957\u20131963\n |\n| 1989 | 40 | Tom Brookshier | CB | 1953\u20131961\n |\n| 44 | Pete Retzlaff | TE | 1956\u20131966\n |\n| 1990 | 22 | Timmy Brown | RB | 1960\u20131967\n |\n| 1991 | 76 | Jerry Sisemore | OT | 1973\u20131987\n |\n| 75 | Stan Walters | OT | 1975\u20131983\n |\n| 1992 | 7 | Ron Jaworski | QB | 1977\u20131986\n |\n| 1993 | 28 | Bill Bradley | S\u2013P | 1969\u20131976\n |\n| 1994 | \u2014 | Dick Vermeil | Head coach | 1976\u20131982\n |\n| 1995 | \u2014 | Jim Gallagher | Team Executive | 1949\u20131995\n |\n| 82 | Mike Quick | WR | 1982\u20131990\n |\n| 1996 | 99 | Jerome Brown | DT | 1987\u20131991\n |\n| 1999 | \u2014 | Otho Davis | Head Trainer | 1973\u20131995\n |\n| 1948 NFL Championship team\n |\n| 1949 NFL Championship team\n |\n| 2004 | 76 | Bob Brown | OT | 1964\u20131968\n |\n| 2005 | 92 | Reggie White | DE | 1985\u20131992\n |\n| 2009 | 70 | Al Wistert | OT | 1943\u20131951\n |\n| 12 | Randall Cunningham | QB\u2013P | 1985\u20131995\n |\n| 2011 | 21 | Eric Allen | CB | 1988\u20131994\n |\n| \u2014 | Jim Johnson | Defensive Coordinator | 1999\u20132008\n |\n| 2012 | \u2014 | Leo Carlin | Ticket Manager | 1960\u20131982, 1985-2015\n |\n| 20 | Brian Dawkins | S | 1996\u20132008\n |\n| 23 | Troy Vincent | CB | 1996\u20132003\n |\n| 2013 | 5 | Donovan McNabb | QB | 1999\u20132009\n |\n| 2015 | 36 | Brian Westbrook | RB | 2002\u20132009\n |\n| 55 | Maxie Baughan | LB | 1960\u20131965\n |\n| 2016 | 54 | Jeremiah Trotter | LB | 1998\u20132001, 2004\u20132006, 2009\n |\n| \u2013 | Merrill Reese | Radio Play by Play | 1977\u2013present\n |\n| 2017 | 2 | David Akers | K | 1999\u20132010\n |\n| 2018 | 59 | Seth Joyner | LB | 1986\u20131993\n |\n| 96 | Clyde Simmons | DE | 1986\u20131993\n |\n| 2019 | 83 | Bobby Walston | WR\u2013TE\u2013K | 1951\u20131962\n |\n| 2021 | 72 | Tra Thomas | OT | 1998-2008\n |\n| 69 | Jon Runyan | OT | 2000-2008\n |\n| 2022 | 53 | Hugh Douglas | DE | 1998-2002, 2004\n |\n| 58 | Trent Cole | DE, OLB | 2005-2014\n |\n\n\n### 75th Anniversary Team[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n| Position\n | Player\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Offense\n |\n| QB | Donovan McNabb | 1999\u20132009\n |\n| RB | Steve Van Buren | 1944\u20131951\n |\n| FB | Keith Byars | 1986\u20131992\n |\n| WR | Harold Carmichael | 1971\u20131983\n |\n| Tommy McDonald | 1957\u20131963\n |\n| TE | Pete Pihos | 1947\u20131955\n |\n| LT | Tra Thomas | 1998\u20132008\n |\n| LG | Wade Key | 1970\u20131979\n |\n| C | Chuck Bednarik | 1949\u20131962\n |\n| RG | Shawn Andrews | 2004\u20132009\n |\n| RT | Jon Runyan | 2000\u20132008\n |\n| Defense\n |\n| DE | Clyde Simmons | 1986\u20131993\n |\n| Reggie White | 1985\u20131992\n |\n| DT | Jerome Brown | 1987\u20131991\n |\n| Charlie Johnson | 1977\u20131981\n |\n| OLB | Seth Joyner | 1986\u20131993\n |\n| Alex Wojciechowicz | 1946\u20131950\n |\n| MLB | Chuck Bednarik | 1949\u20131962\n |\n| CB | Eric Allen | 1988\u20131994\n |\n| Troy Vincent | 1996\u20132003\n |\n| FS | Brian Dawkins | 1996\u20132008\n |\n| SS | Andre Waters | 1984\u20131993\n |\n| Special teams\n |\n| K | David Akers | 1999\u20132010\n |\n| P | Sean Landeta | 1999\u20132002, 2005\n |\n| KR | Timmy Brown | 1960\u20131967\n |\n| PR | Brian Westbrook | 2002\u20132009\n |\n| ST | Vince Papale | 1976\u20131979\n |\n| Coach\n |\n| HC | Andy Reid | 1999\u20132012\n |\n\n\n[146]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia Eagles 75th Anniversary Team (2007)\n |\n| --- |\n| Offense | QB\nMcNabb \nRB\nVan Buren \nFB\nByars \nWR\nCarmichael \nMcDonald \nTE\nPihos \nT\nThomas \nRunyan \nG\nKey \nAndrews \nC\nBednarik\n |\n| Defense | DE\nSimmons \nWhite \nDT\nJ.

In 2011, CBS dropped the music on WYSP, renaming it WIP-FM and making it a full simulcast of WIP. By 2020, 610 WIP had changed call letters to WTEL and rebranded to the Philadelphia affiliate for the Black Information Network, while WIP-FM broadcast all Eagles games. In 2017, the Eagles extended their broadcasting contract with WIP-FM through 2024.[147]\n\n\nMerrill Reese, who joined the Eagles in 1976, is the play-by-play announcer, and former Eagles wide receiver Mike Quick, who replaced offense lineman Stan Walters beginning in 1998, is the color analyst. The post-game show, which has consisted of many Philadelphia sports personalities, as of the 2014 season is hosted by Kevin Riley, a former Eagles linebacker and special-teamer, and Rob Ellis. Riley was the former post-game host for the show on 94 WYSP before the WIP change over; Rob Ellis hosts a weekly show nightly from 6\u201310 on 94.1 WIP-FM.\n\n\nSpanish language broadcasts are on WEMG\u00a0Mega 105.7FM\u00a0with Rickie Ricardo on play-by-play, and Oscar Budejen as\u00a0color commentator.\n\n\nIn 2015, the preseason games were being televised on WCAU, the local NBC owned and operated station.\n\n\nDuring the regular season, games are governed by the NFL's master broadcasting contract with Fox, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. Most games can be seen on Fox-owned WTXF-TV. When hosting an AFC team, those games can be seen on CBS-owned KYW-TV.\n\n\n\n## Training camp[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia Eagles training camp at the NovaCare Complex in South Philadelphia in 2019\nThe Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July through mid-August each year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley.[148] In 2013, with the addition of head coach Chip Kelly, the Eagles moved their training camp to the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.[149][150] Training camps were previously held at Chestnut Hill Academy in 1935, Saint Joseph's University in 1939 and 1943, Saranac Lake from 1946 to 1948, Hershey from 1951 to 1967, Albright College from 1968 to 1972, Widener University from 1973 to 1979, and West Chester University from 1980 to 1995.[150]\n\n\n\n## Fight song[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fly, Eagles Fly\n\nThis fight song is heard during Eagles' home games after touchdowns and before the team is introduced prior to kickoff.\n\n\n\n## Eagles' cheerleaders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleaders\n\n![](image)Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleaders in 2008\nThe Eagles have their own cheerleading squad, which performs a variety of dance routines for the fans and the Eagles on the sideline.[151] The squad also releases a swimsuit calendar each year, and is the first squad in the league to release the calendar on the Android and iOS mobile systems.[152][153]\n\n\n\n## Fans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A full house at The Linc for an NFC playoff game against the Green Bay Packers on January 9, 2011\n![](image)An Eagles fan at U.S. Bank Stadium celebrates the Eagles Super Bowl LII victory on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Eagles fans celebrate along Benjamin Franklin Parkway at the Eagles' Super Bowl victory parade in Center City Philadelphia on February 8, 2018\n### Devotion[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the method may vary, studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in the NFL consistently place Eagles fans among the best in the league, noting their \"unmatched fervor.\"[154] American City Business Journals, which conducts a regular study to determine the most loyal fans in the NFL, [155] ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999[156] and 2006.[157] The 2006 study called Eagles fans \"incredibly loyal\", noting that they filled 99.8% of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade.[158] *Forbes* placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008 survey,[159] which was based on the correlation between team performance and fan attendance.[160] ESPN.com placed Eagles fans fourth in the league in its 2008 survey, citing the connection between the team's performance and the mood of the city.[161] The last home game that was blacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being sold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, September 12, 1999, which was Andy Reid's first home game as new head coach of the Eagles.[162]\n\n\nThe studies note that, whether the Eagles have winning or losing teams, fans can be counted on to pack the stadium each year. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 consecutive games, and 70,000 additional fans were on the Eagles' waiting list for season tickets.[161] Despite finishing with a 6\u201310 record in the 2005 season, the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened.[163]\n\n\nEagles fans have also been known to chant the famous, \"E-A-G-L-E-S \u2013 Eagles!\" at Flyers, Phillies, and 76ers games when the team is getting blown out late in a game and a loss is inevitable, signifying their displeasure with the given team's performance, and that they are instead putting their hope into the Eagles.\n\n\nNotable famous fans of the Eagles include actor Bradley Cooper,[164] actor and comedian Kevin Hart,[165] *Jeopardy!* champion Brad Rutter,[166] journalists Jake Tapper[167] and Jesse Watters,[168] morning talk show host Kelly Ripa,[169] TV personality Jim Cramer,[170] and soccer star Carli Lloyd; the latter of whom also appeared at a joint practice of the Eagles with the Baltimore Ravens in 2019 where she nailed a 55-yard field goal attempt.[171] One week later, during an international friendly pitting the United States against Portugal at Lincoln Financial Field, Lloyd celebrated scoring a goal by doing the \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!\u201d chant.[172] The United States ultimately won that match 4\u20130.\n\n\n\n### Bad behavior[edit]\n\n\nAlong with their fierce devotion, Eagles fans have a reputation for bad behavior and sports-related violence, especially when the team plays its rivals.[173]\n\n\nIn 2006, HarperCollins published *If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?*, a book by Jere\u00e9 Longman, in which he describes the fans of the 700 Level at Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for \"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.\"[174]\n\n\nA 1997 game against the San Francisco 49ers in Philadelphia featured so many incidents that, beginning at the following home game, the Eagles appointed a judge, Seamus McCaffery, to preside over a temporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[173] Fan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and \"Eagles Court\" ended in December 2003.[175]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Invincible (2006 film) and Silver Linings Playbook\n\nThe 1976 Philadelphia Eagles season was the subject of the movie *Invincible*. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale, a part-time school teacher, who is a diehard Eagles fan who became an Eagles player. The film differs slightly from true events as the selection process was invitation-only, and Papale had at least some previous playing experience.[176] The film *Silver Linings Playbook* highlights the 2008 Philadelphia Eagles season, and the novel mentions the 2006 team. The film was critically acclaimed and nominated for several awards including 8 Academy Awards.\n\n\nThe award-winning comedy series *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* makes several references to the Philadelphia Eagles, most notably on Season 3, Episode 2, \"The Gang Gets Invincible,\" a reference to the 2006 Wahlberg film.[177]\n\n\nThe Eagles are referenced in the 1978 Academy Award-winning movie *The Deer Hunter*. During a hunting trip in Pennsylvania, Nick and Stan are in a bar, and Nick says, \"Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles never cross the fifty in the next half and Pittsburgh wins by 20!\" Stan responds, \"And I got an extra twenty says the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!\"[178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes' list of the most valuable sports teams\n* List of Philadelphia Eagles seasons\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* Sports in Philadelphia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** For information about Eagles' uniform numbers, see Berman, Zach (November 18, 2016). \"What's in a number?

The Flyers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference.[3] The team plays its home games in Wells Fargo Center in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, an indoor arena they share with the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Part of the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post\u2013Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 1973\u201374 and again in 1974\u201375.\n\n\nThe Flyers' all-time points percentage of 57.1% (as of the 2021\u201322 NHL season[update]) is the third-best in the NHL, behind only the Vegas Golden Knights and Montreal Canadiens.[4] Additionally, the Flyers have the most appearances in the conference finals of all 24 expansion teams (16 appearances, winning 8), and they are second behind the St. Louis Blues for the most playoff appearances out of all expansion teams (40 out of 54 seasons).[4]\n\n\nThe Flyers have played their home games on Broad Street since their inception, first at the Spectrum from 1967 until 1996, and then at the Wells Fargo Center since 1996. The Flyers have had rivalries with several teams over the years. Historically, their biggest adversaries have been the New York Rangers, with an intense rivalry stretching back to the 1970s. They have also waged lengthy campaigns against the New York Islanders in the 1970s and 1980s, the Boston Bruins in the 1970s and 2010s, the Washington Capitals, since their days in the Patrick Division,[5][6] as well as the New Jersey Devils, with whom they traded the Atlantic Division title every season between 1994\u201395 and 2006\u201307, and with their cross-state rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, which is considered by many to be the best rivalry in the league.[7][8][9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### NHL in Philadelphia before 1967[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Quakers, who played during the 1930\u201331 season, was Philadelphia's first NHL franchise.\nPrior to 1967, Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the 1930\u201331 season, when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, playing at The Arena at 46th and Market Streets. The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930\u201331 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4\u201336\u20134, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. The Quakers' dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in 1936.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 1946, a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia, to build a $2.5\u00a0million rink to seat 20,000 where the Phillies' former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets, and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons.[12] The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. However, Peto's group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.[13][14][15]\n\n\nWhile attending a basketball game on November 29, 1964, at the Boston Garden, Ed Snider, the then-vice-president of the Philadelphia Eagles, observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last-place ice hockey team.[16] He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the league, which chose the Philadelphia group \u2013 including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman \u2013 over the Baltimore group.\n\n\nOn April 4, 1966, Putnam announced that there was going to be a name-the-team contest.[17] Details of the contest were released on July 12.[17] The team name was announced on August 3.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years (1967\u20131971)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Spectrum was the home arena for the Philadelphia Flyers from 1967 to 1996.\nThe new teams were hampered by restrictive rules that kept all major talent with the \"Original Six\" teams. In the NHL Expansion Draft, most of the players available were either aging veterans or career minor-leaguers before expansion occurred. Among the Flyers' 20 selections were Bernie Parent, Doug Favell, Bill Sutherland, Ed Van Impe, Joe Watson, Lou Angotti, Leon Rochefort and Gary Dornhoefer. Having purchased the minor-league Quebec Aces, the team had a distinctly francophone flavor in its early years, with Parent, Rochefort, Andre Lacroix, Serge Bernier, Jean-Guy Gendron, Simon Nolet and Rosaire Paiement among others. Beginning play in 1967\u201368, the Philadelphia Flyers made their debut on October 11, 1967, losing 5\u20131 on the road to the California Seals.[18] They won their first game a week later, defeating the St. Louis Blues on the road, 2\u20131.[19] The Flyers made their home debut in front of a crowd of 7,812, shutting-out their intrastate rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, 1\u20130 on October 19.[20] Lou Angotti was named the first captain in Flyers history, while Rochefort was the Flyers' top goal scorer after netting a total of 21 goals. With all six expansion teams grouped into the same division, the Flyers were able to win the division with a sub-.500 record despite being forced to play their last seven home games on the road due to a storm blowing parts of the Spectrum's roof off.[21] However, playoff success did not come so quickly, as the Flyers were upset by St. Louis in a first-round, seven-game series.\n\n\nAngotti left the team in the off-season, being replaced by Van Impe as team captain. Led by Van Impe and the team-leading 24 goals of Andre Lacroix, the Flyers struggled during their sophomore season by finishing 15 games under .500. Despite their poor regular season showing in 1968\u201369, they made the playoffs. They again lost to St. Louis, this time being dispatched in a four-game sweep. Not wanting his team to be physically outmatched again, majority owner Ed Snider instructed general manager Bud Poile to acquire bigger, tougher players.[16] While head coach Keith Allen soon after replaced Poile as general manager, this mandate eventually led to one of the most feared teams to ever take the ice in the NHL. The keystone of those teams was acquired when the Flyers took a chance on a 19-year-old diabetic from Flin Flon, Manitoba, Bobby Clarke, with their second draft pick, 17th overall, in the 1969 NHL Amateur Draft. Keeping to Snider's mandate, the team also drafted future enforcer Dave Schultz 52nd overall.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ed Snider, the team's initial co-owner\nBy the time training camp came around, it was clear that Clarke was the team's best player, and he quickly became a fan favorite. His 15 goals and 31 assists in his rookie season earned him a trip to the NHL All-Star Game. Despite his arrival, the team struggled in 1969\u201370, recording only 17 wins \u2013 the fewest in franchise history and set the NHL team record for most ties in a season (24). They lost the tiebreaker for the final playoff spot to the Oakland Seals, missing the playoffs for the first time.\n\n\nOn December 11, 1969, the Flyers introduced what became one of the team's best-known traditions: playing a recording of Kate Smith singing \"God Bless America\" instead of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before important games. The perception was that the team was more successful on these occasions, so the tradition grew. The move was initially done by Flyers Promotion Director Lou Scheinfeld as a way to defray national tensions at the time of the Vietnam War: Scheinfeld noticed that people regularly left their seats and walked around during the anthem, but showed more respect and often sang along to \"God Bless America\". As of the close of the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers have a record of 100\u201329\u20135 when \"God Bless America\" was sung prior to Flyers home games.[22]\n\n\nIn 1970\u201371, the Flyers had bounced back from the previous season and returned to the playoffs, but were swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round. Even though the team had improved their record in his second season behind the bench, head coach Vic Stasiuk was replaced by Fred Shero in the off-season. The team was involved in a three way trade that sent Bernie Parent to the Toronto Maple Leafs while receiving Rick MacLeish from the Boston Bruins. \n\n\n\n### Broad Street Bullies (1971\u20131981)[edit]\n\n\n\"Broad Street Bullies\" redirects here. For the documentary, see Broad Street Bullies (film).\nThe team began to shift to a more aggressive style of play while also dominating on offense during this time. Bobby Clarke continued to progress as he led the team in scoring in 1971\u201372 and became the first Flyer to win an NHL award, the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. However, in the season's final game, the Flyers needed a win or a tie against the second-year Buffalo Sabres to beat out Pittsburgh for the final playoff spot. The score was tied late in the game, but with just four seconds on the clock, former Flyer Gerry Meehan took a shot from just inside the blue line that eluded Flyers goaltender Doug Favell.[23] The Flyers lost the head-to-head tiebreaker to Pittsburgh and missed the playoffs.\n\n\n![](image)Jersey of Flyers' goaltender Bernie Parent, who played for the Flyers from 1967\u201368 to 1970\u201371 and again from 1973\u201374 to 1978\u201379\nAs it turned out, it was the last time the Flyers missed the playoffs for 18 years. In the 1972\u201373 season the Flyers got rid of the mediocre expansion team label and instead became the intimidating \"Broad Street Bullies\", a nickname coined by Jack Chevalier and Pete Cafone of the *Philadelphia Bulletin* on January 3, 1973,[24] after a 3\u20131 brawling victory over the Atlanta Flames that led Chevalier to write in his game account, \"The image of the fightin' Flyers spreading gradually around the NHL, and people are dreaming up wild nicknames. They're the Mean Machine, the Bullies of Broad Street and Freddy's Philistines.\" Cafone wrote the accompanying headline: \"Broad Street Bullies Muscle Atlanta.\"[25] That same month, Clarke was the youngest player (at that time) in NHL history to be named team captain, replacing Ed Van Impe. Rick MacLeish became the first Flyer to score 50 goals in a season and the Flyers recorded their first winning season.\n\n\nAn overtime goal by Gary Dornhoefer in Game 5 turned the tide of their first-round series with the Minnesota North Stars in the Flyers' favor, as the Flyers got their first playoff series win in six games. However, they were outmatched in the semi-finals by the Montreal Canadiens, losing in five games. After the season, Clarke became the first expansion team player to be awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player.\n\n\n\n#### 1973\u201374 Stanley Cup champions[edit]\n\n\nGoaltender Bernie Parent returned to the franchise in the off-season, and the Flyers proved that the expansion teams could challenge the Original Six in 1973\u201374. The Bullies continued their rough-and-tumble ways, led by Dave Schultz's 348 penalty minutes, and reached the top of the West Division with a record of 50\u201316\u201312. The return of Parent proved to be of great benefit, as he established himself as one of if not the best goaltender in the league after winning 47 games, a record which stood for 33 years.[26] Since the Flyers, along with Chicago, allowed the fewest goals in the league, Parent also shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago's Tony Esposito.\n\n\nCome playoff time, the Flyers swept the Atlanta Flames in four games in the first round. In the Semi-finals, the Flyers faced the New York Rangers. The series, which saw the home team win every game, went seven games. Fortunately for the Flyers, they had home-ice advantage as they advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals by winning Game 7 and in the process made history by becoming the first expansion team to win a playoff series over an Original Six team.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bobby Clarke played for the Flyers from 1969\u201370 to 1983\u201384\nTheir opponent, Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins, took Game 1 in Boston, but Bobby Clarke scored an overtime goal in Game 2 to even the series. The Flyers then won Games 3 and 4 at home to take a 3\u20131 series lead, though Boston won Game 5 to stave off elimination. That set the stage for Game 6 at the Spectrum. Kate Smith appeared in person before Game 6 to sing her rendition of \"God Bless America\", even miming a \"knockout punch\" after her performance. The Flyers picked up the lead early when Rick MacLeish scored a first-period goal. Late in the game, Orr hauled down Clarke on a breakaway, a penalty which assured the Flyers of victory. Time expired as the Flyers brought the Stanley Cup to Philadelphia for the first time. Parent, having shutout Boston in Game 6, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### 1974\u201375 Stanley Cup champions[edit]\n\n\nUnder the 1974\u201375 season, Dave Schultz topped his mark from the previous season by setting an NHL record for penalty minutes with 472. Clarke's efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy. The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of 51\u201318\u201311, the best record in the NHL. After a first-round bye, the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York-area team in the semi-finals, the New York Islanders. The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep after winning the first three games. However, the Islanders fought back by winning the next three games, setting up a deciding seventh game. The Flyers were finally able to shut the door on the Islanders, winning Game 7, 4\u20131.\n\n\nFacing Buffalo in the Stanley Cup Finals, the Flyers won the first two games at home. Game 3, played in Buffalo, went down in hockey lore as \"The Fog Game\" due to an unusual May heatwave in Buffalo that forced parts of the game to be played in heavy fog, as Buffalo's arena lacked air conditioning. The Flyers lost Games 3 and 4, but won Game 5 at home in dominating fashion, 5\u20131. On the road for Game 6, Bob Kelly scored the decisive goal and Parent pitched another shutout (a playoff record fifth shutout) as the Flyers repeated as Stanley Cup champions. Parent also repeated as the playoff MVP, winning a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Rick MacLeish played for the Flyers from 1970\u201371 to 1980\u201381 and again in 1983\u201384\nThe highlight of the 1975\u201376 season had no bearing on the season standings. On January 11 at the Spectrum, the Flyers, as part of the Super Series '76, played a memorable exhibition game against the Soviet Union's dominant Central Red Army team. As the Bullies had put intimidation to good use the past three years, the Flyers' rugged style of play led the Soviets to leave the ice midway through the first period, protesting a hit on Valeri Kharlamov, whom Clarke had slashed on the ankle in the famous Summit Series '72, by Ed Van Impe. After some delay, the Soviets returned after they were warned that they would lose their salary for the entire series. The Flyers went on to win the game rather easily, 4\u20131, and were the only team to defeat the Red Army outright in the series. After that win, the Spectrum became known as the \"most intimidating building to play in and has the most intimidating fans.\" Head coach Fred Shero proclaimed, \"Yes we are world champions. If they had won, they would have been world champions. We beat the hell out of a machine.\"[27]\nThe Flyers recorded the best record in team history (points-wise) with a record of 51\u201313\u201316 and set the record for most consecutive home wins in regulation (20). The LCB line, featuring Reggie Leach at right-wing, Bobby Clarke at center and Bill Barber at left-wing, set an NHL record for goals by a single line with 141 (Leach 61, Clarke 30, Barber 50). Clarke, on his way to a third Hart Trophy, set a club record for points in one season with 119. Heading into the playoffs, the Flyers squeaked past Toronto in seven games and defeated Boston in five games, with Game 5 featuring a five-goal outburst by Leach, the \"Riverton Rifle\", to head to a third-straight appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers did not come close to a third straight championship without an injured Bernie Parent, as they ran into an up-and-coming dynasty in Montreal, and were swept in four-straight games. Despite the loss, Leach was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for scoring a record 19 goals in 16 playoff games.\n\n\nDethroned, the heyday of the Broad Street Bullies began to come to an end, as prior to the 1976\u201377 season, tough-guy Dave Schultz was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. Despite a slight drop-off in performance, the Flyers dominated the Patrick Division with what proved to be their fourth-straight division title. After disposing of Toronto in six games, the Flyers found themselves in the Semi-finals for the fifth consecutive season. Pitted against Boston, the Flyers lost Games 1 and 2 at home in overtime and did not return home as they were swept in four straight games. The Flyers lost their hold on the Patrick Division in 1977\u201378 and settled for second place. After sweeping the Colorado Rockies in two games in the preliminary round, the Flyers moved on to beat Buffalo in five games. They then faced Boston in the semi-finals for the second consecutive season, and lost again, this time in five games. Following the season, the Flyers were stunned when head coach Shero left to become general manager and head coach of the New York Rangers. As compensation for Shero, the Flyers received the Rangers' first-round draft pick in 1978.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bill Barber played for the Flyers from 1972\u201373 to 1983\u201384\nBob McCammon, who had just coached the Flyers' first year American Hockey League (AHL) Maine Mariners farm club to a Calder Cup title, replaced Fred Shero behind the bench. After a slow start in 1978\u201379, the Flyers switched McCammon with Pat Quinn, Shero's previous assistant coach, who had replaced McCammon with the Mariners. Adding to the problems, Bernie Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury. The Flyers rallied under Quinn and finished in second place. Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks in the preliminary round, the Flyers won the series in three games. The Flyers' season came to an end against Fred Shero's Rangers in a five-game quarterfinal loss.\n\n\nThe Flyers began the 1979\u201380 season with a somewhat controversial move by naming Clarke a playing assistant coach and giving the captaincy to Mel Bridgman. While Clarke was against this initially, he accepted his new role. The Flyers went undefeated for a North American professional sports record 35-straight games (25\u20130\u201310), before losing 7\u20131 to the Minnesota North Stars, a record that still stands to this day.[28] The streak started after the team was 1\u20131 on October 14, and ended on January 7, 1980.[29] In doing so, the Flyers wrapped up the Patrick Division title with 14 games to spare and the first overall seed in the playoffs. Their regular season success continued into the playoffs, as the Flyers swept a young Wayne Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers in the first round, then went on to get revenge against Fred \"The Fog\" Shero and his Rangers by beating them in five before disposing of Minnesota in five to lock up a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the Islanders for the Cup, the Flyers ultimately lost in six games on Bob Nystrom's overtime Stanley Cup-winning goal. The end result of the series was marred by controversy, as the Islanders were offside on the play that resulted in their second goal, but the call was not made. Linesman Leon Stickle admitted after the game that he had blown the call. After a tough, five-game preliminary round series win against the Quebec Nordiques, the team's 1980\u201381 season came to an end as they lost in the quarterfinals to the Calgary Flames in seven games.[30]\n\n\n\n### New generation takes over (1981\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\nSoon the last of the Broad Street Bullies guard moved on. Gone were the likes of Leach, MacLeish, Dupont, Kelly, Jimmy Watson and finally Barber and Clarke in 1984, and taking their spots over the next few seasons were young talent such as Brian Propp, Tim Kerr, Dave Poulin, Pelle Lindbergh and Mark Howe, who upon arrival instantly became the Flyers' top defenseman for the next decade. \n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Howe played for the Flyers from 1982\u201383 to 1991\u201392\nOver the next three seasons the team would suffer early playoff exits and manage to win only one playoff game during that span. They were eliminated two years in a row in 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 by the New York Rangers and then were swept by the Washington Capitals in 1983\u201384. Following the loss to Washington, Bobby Clarke retired from play and was named vice-president and general manager of the team. Mike Keenan, a relative unknown at the time, was hired in 1984 to coach the team, and named second-year player Dave Poulin team captain.\n\n\nBehind the goaltending of Pelle Lindbergh (who led the NHL with 40 wins and was the first European to win the Vezina Trophy),[26] the Flyers won a franchise-record 53 games \u2013 best in the NHL \u2013 during the 1984\u201385 season. The Flyers rolled through the playoffs by sweeping the Rangers in three games, defeating the Islanders in five and beating Quebec in six to return to the Stanley Cup Finals. Though they defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Oilers in Game 1 by a score of 4\u20131 at home, Edmonton won the next four games in a row and the series.\n\n\nA month into the 1985\u201386 season, Pelle Lindbergh was killed in a car accident. The team rallied and showed perseverance by garnering the best record in the Wales Conference and matching their win total (53) from the previous year. Tim Kerr scored 58 goals and the defense pairing of Howe and Brad McCrimmon led the League in plus-minus, a +85 and a +83, respectively. Bob Froese filled in admirably in net for Lindbergh, being named a second Team All-Star and sharing the William M. Jennings Trophy with teammate Darren Jensen. Despite their regular season success, an emotionally exhausted Flyers team lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Rangers in five games.\n\n\nDuring the 1986\u201387 season, the Flyers were rejuvenated by the ascension of 22-year-old goaltender Ron Hextall.[26] In his rookie season, he became the third Flyers goaltender to win the Vezina Trophy, joining Parent and Lindbergh. With Hextall providing the critical stops at crucial times, the Flyers captured a third-straight Patrick Division title, and were able to gain revenge on the Rangers by beating them in six games in the division semifinals, as well as surviving a tough seven-game test from a gritty Islanders club, in the division finals. The Flyers then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in a fiery six-game series (notable for a famous bench-clearing brawl during the Game 6 warmup) to win the Wales Conference and return to the Stanley Cup Finals. As was the case two seasons prior, the Flyers became decimated by injuries, the most significant of which was losing Kerr for the remainder of the playoffs. After falling behind three games to one in the Stanley Cup Finals, the Flyers rallied from a two-goal deficit on the road in Game 5 to extend the series, then won Game 6 at home with another late-game comeback. However, they could not overcome the odds a third time and eventually succumbed to the Oilers, 3\u20131, in Game 7. Hextall was voted playoff MVP, the second time a Flyer won the Conn Smythe Trophy despite being on the losing team (the other being another Manitoban, Reggie Leach, in 1976).[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ron Hextall played for the Flyers from 1986\u201387 to 1991\u201392, and again from 1994\u201395 to 1998\u201399\nThe Flyers stumbled in 1987\u201388, finishing third in the Patrick Division (after a first-place finish the previous three years). Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal by firing the puck into an empty net in a December 8 game against Boston. In their first-round playoff series with Washington, the Flyers blew a 3\u20131 series lead as Washington forced a Game 7. They then blew a 3\u20130 lead in Game 7 as Washington won in overtime 5\u20134. It was because of this playoff collapse that \"Iron Mike\" was fired. Paul Holmgren was named Keenan's replacement, the first time a former Flyer was named the club's head coach.\n\n\nDespite finishing at the .500 mark in 1988\u201389, the Flyers made the playoffs for the 17th consecutive season. Facing first-place Washington in the first round, the Flyers pulled off the upset in six games. Ron Hextall managed to score another empty-net goal in the waning moments of Game 5, becoming the first NHL goalie to score a goal in the playoffs. The Flyers then defeated Pittsburgh in seven games to make the Wales Conference Finals before bowing out to Montreal in six games.\n\n\nThe 1989\u201390 season got off to a bad start for the Flyers, and continued to get worse. Hextall missed all but eight games due to suspension for attacking Chris Chelios at the end of the Montreal playoff series the previous spring, contract holdout issues, and injury. Holmgren replaced Dave Poulin as captain in December with Ron Sutter, which led to Poulin's (and later that season, Brian Propp's) trade to Boston. As a result, the Flyers missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 1972. Bobby Clarke, having been with the Flyers organization since he was drafted in 1969, was fired and replaced as general manager by Russ Farwell.\n\n\nRon Hextall continued to be hampered by injuries during the 1990\u201391 season. He only played in 36 games and as a result the Flyers missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year, finishing fifth in the Division and three points short of a playoff spot after a late-season collapse.\n\n\n\n### Rebuilding years (1991\u20131994)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eric Lindros trade\n\nPrior to the 1991\u201392 season, the Flyers acquired Rod Brind'Amour from St. Louis. Brind'Amour led the Flyers in goals (33), assists (44) and points (77) in his first season with the club. With Ron Sutter gone to St. Louis in the Brind'Amour trade, Rick Tocchet was named team captain. As the Flyers continued to flounder, Paul Holmgren was fired midway through the season and replaced by Bill Dineen, father of Flyer Kevin Dineen. On February 19, the Flyers and Pittsburgh made a major five-player deal which featured Tocchet \u2013 who never grew comfortably into the role of captain \u2013 heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia. Recchi recorded 27 points in his first 22 games as a Flyer, but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, due in large part to an awful road record (10\u201326\u20134). With Tocchet traded, the Flyers remained without a captain until Kevin Dineen was named to the post in 1993\u201394, and instead went with three alternate captains.\n\n\nIn June 1992, the Flyers persuaded Bobby Clarke to return to the team as senior vice president after Jay Snider won the hard-fought arbitration battle for 1991 first overall pick Eric Lindros against the Rangers. It was determined that Quebec had made a deal with the Flyers before making a deal with the Rangers. In order to acquire Lindros' rights, the Flyers parted with six players, trading Steve Duchesne, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris Simon, a 1993 first-round draft pick (Jocelyn Thibault), a 1994 first-round draft pick (Nolan Baumgartner) and $15\u00a0million to Quebec. While Lindros became a preeminent star in Philadelphia, the trade proved heavily lopsided in favor of the Nordiques \u2013 soon to become the Colorado Avalanche \u2013 providing the core of their two Stanley Cup teams and an unprecedented eight-straight division championships, with Forsberg becoming a franchise player.\n\n\nThe trio of Lindros, Recchi and Brent Fedyk formed the Crazy Eights line in Lindros' first two years in the NHL, the eights being the player's jersey numbers (88, 8 and 18 respectively). In 1992\u201393, Recchi set the franchise record for points in a season with 123 (53 goals and 70 assists) and Lindros scored 41 goals in 61 games. After struggling early, the Flyers made a run at the playoffs, but came four points short of the last spot. Head coach Bill Dineen was fired at the season's end, while Clarke left town again to become general manager of the expansion Florida Panthers.\n\n\nFor 1993\u201394, Terry Simpson was hired as the new head coach in hopes of returning the Flyers to the playoffs after four consecutive off-years. Mark Recchi recorded 107 points (40 goals and 67 assists) and Lindros 97 (44 goals and 53 assists), while Mikael Renberg set a Flyers rookie record with 82 points. Offense was generated yet the Flyers still failed to clinch a playoff berth, again falling four points short of the final playoff spot. Jay Snider stepped down as president, forcing his father Ed Snider to take over day-to-day operations.\n\n\n\n### Return to contention (1994\u20132004)[edit]\n\n\nThe elder Snider had decided he had seen enough of Farwell as general manager, and began courting Bobby Clarke to leave his general manager post with Florida to return to Philadelphia. Farwell's last move as general manager was firing Simpson after a lackluster performance. Clarke returned to the general manager position prior to the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season and immediately began putting his stamp on the team. New head coach Terry Murray replaced Kevin Dineen as team captain with Lindros prior to the start of training camp. In order to shore up the defense, Ron Hextall was re-acquired from the Islanders and high-scoring winger Recchi was traded to Montreal for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair early in the abbreviated season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Eric Lindros played for the Flyers from 1992\u201393 to 1999\u20132000.\n#### Legion of Doom (1994-1997)[edit]\n\n\nThe Flyers initially struggled out of the gate, going only 3\u20137\u20131 through their first 11 games while being outscored 34\u201322. Lindros and LeClair then teamed with Renberg to form the Legion of Doom line, a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation. In their 37 games (including the 3\u20131 victory on February 11, 1995, against the New Jersey Devils), the Flyers went 25\u20139\u20133 and outscored their opponents 128\u201398 en route. Lindros tied Jaromir Jagr for the regular season scoring lead (though Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy with more goals), and captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. The playoff drought came to an end as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference. After dispatching Buffalo in five and sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, the Flyers were upset in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in six games.\n\n\nLindros eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time in 1995\u201396, gathering 115 points, and LeClair scored 51 goals, as the Flyers repeated as Atlantic Division champs and clinched the top seed in the East. Facing the eighth-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning, the Flyers dropped two of the first three games. They rallied by winning three straight games to win the series. After taking two of the first three games against the Florida Panthers in the second round, the Flyers were defeated in overtime in Game 4 and double-overtime in Game 5. An upstart Florida club with stellar goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck ended the Flyers' season in Game 6.\n\n\n\n![](image)In 1996, the Flyers moved to their present home arena, the CoreStates Center (now the Wells Fargo Center).\nThe Flyers said goodbye to the Spectrum and prepared to open a new arena \u2013 the CoreStates Center \u2013 for the next season. The 1996\u201397 season started off slowly, as Lindros missed 30 games, but LeClair still managed to score 50 goals for the second consecutive year, while the mid-season acquisition of defenseman Paul Coffey gave the Flyers a veteran presence.[32] Despite finishing just one point shy of a third straight Atlantic Division title, the Flyers blitzed their way through the first three rounds of the playoffs, dominating Pittsburgh, Buffalo and the Rangers all in five games apiece to win the Eastern Conference championship, and clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1986\u201387. Despite having home-ice advantage, the Flyers were swept in four-straight games by the Detroit Red Wings. The goaltending tandem of Hextall and Garth Snow fared poorly in the Finals, as both conceded soft goals, and Murray's strategy of alternating starters in goal was criticized. After Game 3 which was a 6\u20131 loss, Murray blasted his team in a closed-door meeting and then described to the media that the Flyers were in a \"choking situation\", a remark which angered his players and likely cost Murray his job, as his contract was not renewed. In July, Mikael Renberg was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, in exchange for Chris Gratton, thus splitting up the famed Legion of Doom line. The trio of Lindros, LeClair and Renberg scored a combined total of 666 points in 547 regular season games.\n\n\nThe man picked to replace Murray as coach, Wayne Cashman, was deemed ill-suited for the job as the Flyers played inconsistently throughout the 1997\u201398 season. With 21 games to go in the season, Roger Neilson took over as coach while Cashman was retained as an assistant. John LeClair was able to score at least 50 goals for the third consecutive year (netting 51), the first time for an American-born player, and goaltender Sean Burke was acquired at the trade deadline. Burke proved ineffective in net, as the Flyers were eliminated in the first round by Buffalo in five games.\n\n\nIn the off-season, the Flyers went looking for a new goaltender. Burke was let go and Hextall was about to enter his final season as a backup. They chose to sign former Panther John Vanbiesbrouck as the starting goaltender. The 1998\u201399 season was marred by a life-threatening injury sustained by Eric Lindros on April Fools' Day during a game against the Nashville Predators, a season-ending injury later diagnosed as a collapsed lung. Up until that point, Lindros was having an MVP-type season with 40 goals and 53 assists in 71 games. Without Lindros, the Flyers had trouble scoring in the playoffs even after having re-acquired Mark Recchi at the trade deadline. Although Vanbiesbrouck allowed 9 goals to Joseph's 11 allowed, the Flyers lost their first-round series with Toronto in six games.\n\n\nThe 1999\u20132000 season was one of the most tumultuous seasons in franchise history and the tumult actually started three months prior to the start of the regular season. In the span of a few days in July, longtime broadcaster Gene Hart died due to illness and defenseman Dmitri Tertyshny, coming off his rookie season, was fatally injured in a freak boating accident.[33] Head coach Roger Neilson was diagnosed with bone cancer, forcing him to step aside in February 2000 to undergo treatment, so assistant coach Craig Ramsay took over as interim coach for the rest of the season; Neilson later recovered but was informed that he would not return. In January, longtime Flyer and fan-favorite Rod Brind'Amour was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Keith Primeau, with the intention of acquiring a big center to complement Lindros. Meanwhile, the strife between Flyers management (particularly Clarke) and Lindros, continued to worsen. Less than a month after Ramsay took over, Lindros suffered his second concussion of the season. He played several games after the initial hit and afterwards criticized the team's training staff for failing to initially diagnose the concussion after it happened. It was after this that the Flyers' organization decided to strip Lindros of the captaincy on March 27 and name defenseman Eric Desjardins the team's captain.\n\n\n\n![](image)Simon Gagne played for the Flyers from 1999\u20132000 to 2009\u201310, and 2012\u201313.\nWith Lindros out indefinitely, the Flyers rallied to overcome the distractions and a 15-point deficit in the standings to win the Atlantic Division and the top seed in the East on the last day of the regular season. They easily defeated their first-round opponent, Buffalo, in five games. Primeau's goal in the fifth overtime of Game 4 against the team's second-round opponent, Pittsburgh, turned that series in the Flyers' favor as they won in six games, coming back from a 2\u20130 series deficit. After dropping Game 1 to New Jersey in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers won three-straight games to take a 3\u20131 series lead. However, New Jersey won game 5. In Game 6, Lindros returned to the lineup for the first time since March in another losing effort. Early in Game 7, Lindros was handed another concussion and leaving the Philadelphia crowd deflated after being on the receiving end of a controversial hit by Scott Stevens. Without him, the Flyers lost the decisive game 2\u20131. It was the second time in franchise history the team lost a series after being up 3\u20131. Lindros never again wore a Flyers uniform, as he sat out the following season awaiting a trade.\n\n\nCraig Ramsay was named the permanent head coach as Neilson was not asked to return for the 2000\u201301, which became a matter of some controversy. Ramsay lasted only until December when he was replaced by former Flyer great Bill Barber. Brian Boucher, who as a rookie backstopped the Flyers' playoff run the previous season, could not duplicate his performance and lost the starting goaltending job to Roman \u010cechm\u00e1nek, a former star in the Czech Republic. The performance of Cechmanek, worthy of a Vezina nomination, along with Bill Barber winning the Jack Adams Award as head coach of the year, helped the Flyers stay afloat, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to Buffalo in six games.\n\n\nIn the off-season, the Flyers re-vamped their lineup by signing Jeremy Roenick and finally trading Eric Lindros to the Rangers for Kim Johnsson, Jan Hlavac, Pavel Brendl and a 2003 third-round draft pick (Stefan Ruzicka). Desjardins stepped down as team captain eight games into the season and was replaced by Primeau. The Flyers began 2001\u201302 with high expectations and with Roenick leading the team in scoring, the Flyers finished with an Atlantic Division title. The power play was one of the NHL's worst however, so Adam Oates, the third leading point-producer in the League at the time, was acquired from Washington at the NHL trade deadline. However, it was of no benefit as the Flyers could not muster much offense, scoring only two goals in their five-game, first-round playoff loss to the Ottawa Senators. It turned out there was much discontent in the locker room as Bill Barber was fired. The Flyers hired a proven winner when they turned to former Dallas Stars and Stanley Cup-winning head coach Ken Hitchcock.\n\n\n\n![](image)Jeremy Roenick played for the Flyers from 2001\u201302 to 2003\u201304.\nIn 2002\u201303, Roman Cechmanek had a 1.83 goals against average (GAA) and the Flyers acquired Sami Kapanen and Tony Amonte prior to the trade deadline; however, they fell one point short of a second straight Atlantic Division title. Consequently, the Flyers endured a long, brutal seven-game first-round match-up with Toronto that featured three multiple overtime games, all in Toronto. After winning Game 7, 6\u20131, the Flyers fought Ottawa in the second round with equal vigor as they split the first four games of the series, with Cechmanek earning shutouts in both wins. His inconsistency showed through, however, as he allowed ten goals in the final two games, and Ottawa advanced in six games. He was later traded to Los Angeles for a 2004 second-round draft pick during the off-season despite having the second-best GAA in the League over his three years in Philadelphia.\n\n\nFree-agent goaltender Jeff Hackett was signed from Boston to replace Cechmanek and challenge backup Robert Esche for the starter's spot in 2003\u201304, but he was forced to retire in February due to vertigo. During the course of the season, serious injuries suffered by both Roenick (broken jaw) and Primeau (concussion) in February forced the Flyers to trade for Chicago's Alexei Zhamnov, who filled in well and kept the Flyers afloat. On March 5, 2004, the Flyers set an NHL record in a game against Ottawa where they set a combined record of 419 penalty minutes in a single game. Esche entrenched himself as starter and remained in that position even after the Flyers re-acquired Sean Burke from the Phoenix Coyotes as the Flyers clinched the Atlantic Division title over New Jersey on the last day of the season. Though solid in net, Esche's performance was trumped by the play of captain Keith Primeau in the playoffs. Primeau led the Flyers past the defending Stanley Cup champion Devils in five, Toronto in six on their way to the Eastern Conference Finals, and a match-up with Tampa Bay. Despite winning Game 6 on the late-game heroics of Primeau and winger Simon Gagn\u00e9, the Flyers came up short once again, losing Game 7 in Tampa, 2\u20131.\n\n\n\n### From highs to lows (2004\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nWith the NHL preparing for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, left for Pittsburgh during the off-season. Unsure about the future, the Flyers were unsure about his worth. The NHL lockout forced the cancellation of the 2004\u201305 NHL season. The Flyers were one of the more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end. Replacing the high-profile names of Amonte, LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg, along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje, as well as several players from the Calder Cup-winning Philadelphia Phantoms. When all was said and done, the team had experienced a turnover of nearly two-thirds of the roster.\n\n\nThe Flyers began the 2005\u201306 NHL season with lofty expectations. Despite being hampered by injuries prior to and during the season, the Flyers lived up to those expectations in the first half of the season, reaching the top of the league standings in January while simultaneously holding a 10-point lead in the Atlantic Division. The *Deuces Wild* line of Forsberg, Gagne, and Mike Knuble recorded 75, 79 and 65 points respectively while Gagne, with Forsberg feeding him, scored a career-high of 47 goals. However, the injuries began to accumulate and take their toll, the most crippling of which was Keith Primeau's season-ending concussion. Derian Hatcher served as interim captain for the remainder of the season. The Flyers had been first in the league prior to the Olympic break, where an injury to Forsberg occurred. All told, the Flyers were third in the NHL with 388 man-games lost to injury, tops amongst playoff teams.[34] The second half of the regular season was defined by a record hovering around .500, sending the Flyers on a steady slide in the standings. The Flyers fell short of an Atlantic Division title, finishing second by tie-breaker to New Jersey, drawing the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference and a first-round match-up with fourth-seeded Buffalo. The Flyers lost the series in six games.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mike Richards played for the Flyers from 2005\u201306 to 2010\u201311.\nThe Flyers' 40th anniversary season turned out to be the worst in franchise history. The Flyers traded Michal Handzus to Chicago, lost Kim Johnsson to free agency and Eric Desjardins and team captain Keith Primeau retired in the off-season. Peter Forsberg replaced Primeau as team captain, but a chronic foot injury developing in last season's Olympics had him in and out of the lineup throughout the season and limited his effectiveness. Eight games into the regular season and with a record of 1\u20136\u20131, general manager Bobby Clarke resigned and head coach Ken Hitchcock was fired. Assistant coach John Stevens replaced Hitchcock and assistant general manager Paul Holmgren took on Clarke's responsibilities on an interim basis.\n\n\nThe changes did little to improve the Flyers fortunes in 2006\u201307 as setting franchise records for futility became the norm. They had several multiple-game losing streaks, including a franchise-worst 10-game losing streak and a 13-game home losing streak that stretched from November 29 to February 10. Ultimately, the Flyers finished with a 22\u201348\u201312 record, the most losses and the worst winning percentage in franchise history, and the worst record in the league. They also set the NHL record for the biggest points drop off in the standings in a one-year span (101 points in 2005\u201306 to 56 points in 2006\u201307, a difference of 45 points). The Flyers lost the NHL draft lottery to the Chicago Blackhawks and received the second overall selection.\n\n\nWith the team clearly on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time in 13 years, Paul Holmgren set his sights on rebuilding the team and preparing for the future. Forsberg, unwilling to commit to playing next season, was traded to Nashville for Scottie Upshall, Ryan Parent and 2007 first- and third-round draft picks at the deadline. Veteran defenseman Alexei Zhitnik was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for prospect defenseman Braydon Coburn, while disappointing off-season acquisition Kyle Calder was sent to Detroit via Chicago in exchange for defenseman Lasse Kukkonen. The Flyers also acquired goaltender Martin Biron from Buffalo for a 2007 second-round pick. Given wide praise for his efforts, the Flyers gave Holmgren a two-year contract and removed the interim label from his title.\n\n\nBefore the 2007\u201308 season began the Flyers made a trade that sent the first-round draft pick they had acquired in the Forsberg trade (23rd overall) back to Nashville in exchange for the rights to negotiate with impending unrestricted free agents Kimmo Timonen and Scott Hartnell. Both were subsequently signed to six-year contracts. After much speculation about whether the Flyers would keep or trade the second overall pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, the Flyers opted to keep it, using it to select New Jersey native James van Riemsdyk.\n\n\nThe Flyers wasted no time in addressing their free-agent needs. On July 1, the Flyers signed Buffalo co-captain Daniel Briere to an eight-year, $52\u00a0million contract. Continuing to revamp their defensive core, Joni Pitkanen and Geoff Sanderson were traded to Edmonton in exchange for Oilers captain Jason Smith and Joffrey Lupul. Smith was later named Flyers captain on October 1.\n\n\n\n![](image)Jeff Carter played for the Flyers from 2005\u201306 to 2010\u201311.\nThe season began in the image of the *Broad Street Bullies* era, with multiple-game suspensions handed out to five separate players, the most serious being 25-game suspensions to both Steve Downie and Jesse Boulerice for two separate incidents. A 7\u20133 start in October and a 9\u20133\u20131 January run had the Flyers near the top of both the Division and Conference standings. However, a disastrous ten-game losing streak in February, reminiscent of such a streak the previous season, nearly derailed the Flyers' year. An 8\u20133\u20134 run in March, coupled with two huge wins over New Jersey and Pittsburgh over the final weekend of the regular season, put the Flyers back in the 2008 playoffs as the sixth seed, setting up a first-round matchup with Washington. After taking a three-game-to-one lead over the Capitals, Washington then won Games 5 and 6 to force a deciding Game 7 in Washington. After an evenly fought game, the Flyers ultimately won the series in overtime via a Joffrey Lupul powerplay goal. The Flyers then drew a matchup with heavily favored Montreal in the second round. Despite being outshot a majority of the series, the Flyers upset the Canadiens in five games, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2003\u201304 to face Pittsburgh. Before the start of the series, the Flyers suffered a fatal blow when it was learned that Kimmo Timonen was out with a blood clot in his ankle. Coupled with a gruesome facial injury to Braydon Coburn in Game 2, Pittsburgh ran roughshod over the Flyers' depleted defense and jumped out to a 3\u20130 series lead. The Flyers won Game 4 at home to stave off elimination, and although Timonen returned for Game 5, Pittsburgh finished off the Flyers in five games.\n\n\nThe Flyers began the 2008\u201309 season by naming Mike Richards the 17th captain in team history on September 17, with Jason Smith having departed to Ottawa as a free agent. The Flyers were looking to build on the success of the previous season, but instead got off to an 0\u20133\u20133 start. However, despite a solid December and January and finishing with four points more than the year before, for the most part, the 2008\u201309 Flyers played inconsistently and looked like different teams,[*citation needed*] playing at the top of their ability one night and a sub-par performance the next. Derian Hatcher missed the entire regular season and playoffs with a knee injury, and Steve Downie was traded to Tampa Bay with Steve Eminger, whom they had previously acquired in a trade with Washington prior to the season for defenseman Matt Carle. Two pleasant surprises were the emergence of rookie center Claude Giroux and defenseman Luca Sbisa, who was drafted by the Flyers in June with the 19th overall pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for R. J. Umberger, a victim of team salary cap constraints. Scottie Upshall also found himself the victim of such a crunch; he was traded to Phoenix in exchange for Daniel Carcillo at the NHL trade deadline.\n\n\nDespite holding on to the fourth seed in the East for much of the season, thanks to a 4\u20135\u20131 finish to the season, highlighted by a home loss to the Rangers on the last day of the regular season, the Flyers slipped to the fifth seed and lost home-ice advantage in their first-round series with Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh dominated the Flyers in Game 1, and despite a better effort by the Flyers in Game 2, Pittsburgh came to Philadelphia with a 2\u20130 series lead. The Flyers were the better team in Games 3 and 4, but Pittsburgh gained a split in Philadelphia and took a 3\u20131 series lead. After a decisive 3\u20130 win in Game 5, the Flyers jumped out to a 3\u20130 lead in Game 6, but promptly fell victim to the inconsistencies that plagued the team all season and gave up five unanswered goals in a season-ending 5\u20133 loss. Giroux led the team in scoring in the playoffs. Jeff Carter ended the regular season with 46 goals, second in the NHL after Washington's Alexander Ovechkin. Mike Richards just missed out on the Frank J. Selke Trophy in the closest vote in the history of the award.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daniel Briere played for the Flyers from 2007\u201308 to 2012\u201313\nThe Flyers began the 2009\u201310 season with some major changes, allowing goaltenders Martin Biron and Antero Niittymaki to depart via free agency, replacing them with former Ottawa netminder Ray Emery and former Flyer Brian Boucher, and significantly upgrading the defense with the addition of Chris Pronger from Anaheim. Pronger came at a price, however, costing the Flyers Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and the Flyers' first-round draft picks in both 2009 and 2010. The season began in earnest, though it soon unraveled with mediocre play that cost head coach John Stevens his job in December. Peter Laviolette was hired as his replacement in order to reinstitute accountability and restore success to the Flyers, though the results were not immediate; the Flyers suffered a 2\u20137\u20131 stretch immediately following his arrival. Injuries took a major toll on the Flyers, with Blair Betts, Daniel Briere, Jeff Carter, Simon Gagne and Kimmo Timonen all missing significant numbers of games, though no position was nearly affected as much with injuries as goaltending. Emery suffered a hip injury in December, played sporadically afterwards and ultimately underwent season-ending surgery. Boucher suffered a hand injury shortly thereafter, which allowed journeyman goaltender Michael Leighton to step in and make an immediate impact. Leighton went 8\u20130\u20131 in his first ten starts, including a tough 2\u20131 overtime loss in the 2010 Winter Classic to Boston at Fenway Park on New Year's Day. However, Leighton was forced out of the line-up in March with a high ankle sprain, necessitating Boucher's return as starter. All told, seven different goaltenders suited up for the Flyers at various points throughout the year. Mediocre play down the stretch forced the Flyers into a do-or-die shootout with the Rangers in the final game of the regular season. Boucher stopped final shooter Olli Jokinen to clinch the seventh seed in the East and a first-round matchup with New Jersey.\n\n\nBoucher and the Flyers consistently outplayed Martin Brodeur and New Jersey and pulled off the upset in five games. However, the victory was costly, as Carter suffered a broken foot and Gagne a broken toe in Game 4, while Ian Laperriere suffered a grievous facial injury by blocking a shot in Game 5. The Flyers then faced sixth-seeded Boston in the second round, and despite playing at an even level with the Bruins, the Flyers found themselves in a 3\u20130 series deficit. Gagne returned in Game 4 and scored in overtime to force a Game 5, which the Flyers won convincingly, 4\u20130. Boucher suffered MCL sprains during the game in both knees which forced Leighton back into net in his first time suiting up since March. Boucher and Leighton became the first goalies since 1955 to share a playoff shutout. A 2\u20131 Flyers win in Game 6 forced a Game 7 in Boston. Falling behind 3\u20130 in Game 7, the Flyers pulled off the biggest comeback in both franchise and League history, winning 4\u20133 on a late goal by Gagne to join the Maple Leafs in 1942, the Islanders in 1975 and the Boston Red Sox in 2004 as the only sports teams to win a playoff series after trailing 3\u20130.\n\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers had home-ice advantage as they faced eighth-seeded Montreal. Leighton became the first Flyers netminder to record three shutouts in a series, and Carter and Laperriere returned to the lineup as the Flyers won the Eastern Conference Championship in five games, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1997 to face the Chicago Blackhawks. Dropping two close games in Chicago, the Flyers returned home to win Game 3 in overtime and Game 4 to even the series. A convincing 7\u20134 win by Chicago in Game 5, however, put the Flyers one game away from elimination. A late Scott Hartnell goal in Game 6 forced overtime, but Patrick Kane scored just over four minutes into overtime to eliminate the Flyers and give Chicago their first Stanley Cup since 1961. Ville Leino, acquired in a mid-season trade from Detroit, set the Flyers rookie playoff scoring record and tied the NHL record with 21 points. Briere led the NHL playoff scoring race with 30 points, one point ahead of Conn Smythe Trophy winner, Jonathan Toews.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kimmo Timonen played for the Flyers from 2007\u201308 to 2013\u201314.\nComing off the close loss to Chicago in the Finals, the Flyers traded Gagne to Tampa Bay to clear up cap space, acquired Andrej Meszaros from Tampa Bay in a separate trade and signed free agent Sean O'Donnell to shore up the defensive corps. The Flyers started the 2010\u201311 season with rookie goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky from the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in Russia, who recorded an opening-night win in his NHL debut against Pittsburgh and had steady numbers throughout the season. Boucher remained as the team's backup goaltender, while Leighton played one game in December after recovering from a back injury before being demoted to Adirondack in the American Hockey League (AHL). The Flyers led both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference for the majority of the season, and challenged Vancouver for the overall NHL lead. Kris Versteeg was brought in from Toronto to add additional offense for the stretch drive and playoffs. However, lackluster play throughout March and April, coupled with a broken hand suffered by Chris Pronger in late February that ended his regular season, cost the Flyers the top seed in the East during the last week of the regular season, although the Flyers hung on to win their first Atlantic Division title since 2003\u201304 and clinched the second seed in the East.\n\n\nThe Flyers drew Buffalo in the first round. Bobrovsky played well in a 1\u20130 Game 1 loss, but was replaced in Game 2 by Boucher, who held on for a 5\u20134 Flyers win. Boucher played well in a Game 3 win and a Game 4 loss, but was replaced himself in a favor of Leighton during a bad first period in Game 5, which Buffalo won in overtime. Pronger returned to the lineup and Leighton started Game 6 but was replaced by Boucher after a poor first period, though nonetheless the Flyers went on to win in overtime and forced a Game 7, which Boucher started. The Flyers dominated Buffalo, 5\u20132, and became the first team to win a playoff series starting three different goaltenders since 1988. The Flyers then drew a rematch with the Boston Bruins in the second round. Boston dominated the Flyers in Game 1, where Boucher was again replaced, this time by Bobrovsky. Pronger again left the lineup with an undisclosed injury, while Boston won Game 2 in overtime and again dominated the Flyers in Game 3 to take a 3\u20130 series lead. Bobrovsky started Game 4, but there was no comeback like in their previous meeting, as Boston completed the sweep. The Flyers tied an NHL record with seven playoff in-game goalie changes, and were the only NHL team not to record a shutout in either the regular season or playoffs.\n\n\nFlyers general manager Paul Holmgren made two franchise-altering trades within the span of an hour on June 23, 2011, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick, and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011\u201312 season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to sub-par, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3\u20132 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic, but also being named NHL First Star for the month of March. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.[*according to whom?*]\n\n\nThe Flyers drew Pittsburgh in the first round of the 2012 playoffs, a series in which the two teams combined for an NHL-record 45 goals in the first four games and a total of 309 penalty minutes in an intense, fight-filled series. The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a heavily favored Pittsburgh team. In the second round against New Jersey, the Flyers were heavily favored to win the series, but the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and, although they won the first game at home in overtime, the Flyers lost four games in a row and were eliminated in five. Briere and Giroux ended the playoffs tied with five other players for the League lead in playoff goals with eight, despite their team being eliminated in the second round.\n\n\nThe team began the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season by naming Claude Giroux captain on January 15, 2013, and starting off at 0\u20133\u20130, their worst start in 17 years.[35] The franchise finished at a record of 23\u201322\u20133, fourth in the Atlantic and tenth in the East. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since the 2006\u201307 season and only the ninth time in team history. During the off-season, the Flyers used their two contract buyouts allotted by the new league collective bargaining agreement on Bryzgalov and Briere, and signed free agents Mark Streit (four years, $21 million) and Vincent Lecavalier (five years, $22.5 million).\n\n\nOn October 7, head coach Peter Laviolette and assistant coach Kevin McCarthy were both fired just three games into the 2013\u201314 season after the team again began the season 0\u20133\u20130. Assistant coach Craig Berube, who previously played for the Flyers and served two stints as head coach of the Flyers' AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms, was named the new head coach, while John Paddock and former Flyer Ian Laperriere were announced as Berube's assistants.[36] The team went 42\u201327\u201310 with Berube behind the bench, clinching a playoff berth and ultimately falling in seven games to the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference First Round.\n\n\n\n### Multiple makeovers (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nOn May 7, 2014, the club announced that general manager Paul Holmgren had been promoted to president, with assistant general manager Ron Hextall filling his vacancy. Hextall laid out a new plan for the franchise to develop players from within their system, rather than through outside acquisitions.[37] In order to free up valuable cap space, Scott Hartnell was traded before the start of the 2014\u201315 NHL season, following Braydon Coburn and Kimmo Timonen being traded away mid-season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Claude Giroux played for the Flyers from 2007\u201308 to 2021\u201322, serving as team captain for 10 seasons.The Flyers did not qualify for the playoffs for the second time in three seasons in 2014\u201315, and head coach Berube was subsequently fired after the season.[38] The Flyers finished with 33 wins and 31 losses for 84 points.[39] On May 18, 2015, the Flyers hired the former head coach of the University of North Dakota's men's ice hockey team, Dave Hakstol. Hakstol had been North Dakota's coach for the past 8 seasons, during which he accumulated a 289\u2013143\u201343 record and led the school to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship in each season at the helm. In 2014\u201315, the University went 29\u201310\u20133 and advanced to the Frozen Four for the seventh time during Hakstol's tenure.[40]\n\n\nThe Flyers began the 2015\u201316 season with a record of 4\u20132\u20131 in their first seven games. They found themselves outside of the playoff picture near the halfway point of the regular season, but a second-half surge, including a combined record of 17\u20137\u20135 in February and March, placed them into playoff position. On the second-to-last day of the season, the Flyers clinched the final wild-card playoff berth with a win over Pittsburgh and an Ottawa win over Boston, which consequently eliminated the Bruins from playoff contention. The Flyers faced Washington in the first round, losing the first three games of the series. The Flyers would rally to win the next two games, but lost the series in six games.\n\n\nOn April 11, 2016, Flyers longtime chairman, co-founder, and former majority owner Ed Snider died after a two-year battle with bladder cancer.[41][42][43] In the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers won ten straight games during the months of November and December. However, they fell out of the playoff picture after that streak ended, struggling in the standings and letting other teams get ahead of them. They were eliminated from playoff contention during the last two weeks of the regular season, becoming the first team to miss the playoffs after having a winning streak of ten or more games in the process.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wayne Simmonds played for the Flyers from 2011\u201312 to 2018\u201319Despite finishing sixth in their division, they won the second overall pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft lottery with just a 2.4% chance to win that particular pick. They used this pick to select Nolan Patrick from the Brandon Wheat Kings. In the 2017\u201318 season, the Flyers rallied from a 10-game losing streak early in the season to finish in third place in the Metropolitan Division but lost to Pittsburgh in six games in the first round of the 2018 playoffs. They clinched a playoff spot on the last game of the season, at home against the Rangers, winning 5\u20130 with the help of a Claude Giroux hat trick. In that game, Giroux became the first Flyer to have a 100-point season since Eric Lindros in 1995\u201396, finishing second in league scoring and fourth in MVP voting, while Couturier was a finalist for the Selke Trophy, and Simmonds was a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award.\n\n\nAfter failing to meet expectations to start the 2018\u201319 season, Ron Hextall was fired as general manager.[44] Two weeks later, Dave Hakstol was fired as head coach after the Flyers' 12\u201315\u20134 start to the season.[45] Chuck Fletcher was hired as the team's general manager on December 3, 2018, and would later be named the team's president, after Paul Holmgren stepped down from the role.[46][47] Due to racial controversy involving vocalist Kate Smith, at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, the Flyers removed her statue from outside the stadium and stopped playing her version of \"God Bless America\".[48] The Flyers fell apart as the season went on, missing the playoffs.\n\n\n\n![](image)Jakub Voracek played for the Flyers from 2011\u201312 to 2020\u201321Heading into the 2019\u201320 season, the Flyers hired coach Alain Vigneault and signed forward Kevin Hayes in the hopes of bringing the team to cup contender status again. Opening day took place in the Czech Republic, Jake Voracek's birthplace. The Flyers beat the Blackhawks 4\u20132. The Flyers started off the season very well, tying a team record for the best November in team history with a record of 10\u20133\u20134.[49] The Flyers produced consistent, cohesive hockey throughout the season. One of the most notable progressions in the team was the chemistry of the team and the success of the second line, which consisted of Scott Laughton, Kevin Hayes, and Travis Konecny. In February, the team pulled away from the pack of Wild-Card spot chasers and reached second place in the Metropolitan Division following a home win against the Rangers that put their February record at 9\u20133. The Flyers ended up with a nine-game winning streak, losing at home against the Boston Bruins, the NHL's points leader. The Flyers were scheduled to play at Tampa Bay on March 12, but the NHL suspended all games earlier in the day due to COVID-19 concerns. The Flyers were second in the Metropolitan Division, only 1 point behind the Capitals.\n\n\nThe Flyers entered the postseason \"bubble\" in Toronto as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, meaning they had clinched a playoff appearance and were to play in a seeding round-robin between the top 4 teams of the conference. The Flyers beat the Bruins in the first game 4\u20131, the Capitals in the second game 3\u20131, and the Lightning in the third game 4\u20131 to claim the number 1 seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since the 1999\u20132000 season. Despite high expectations after sweeping the round-robin play, going 0 for 11 on the power play was a detriment to the team's play.[50] Regardless, they went into the first round against the 12-seed Canadiens, who had beat the 5-seed Penguins in the qualifying series, with much confidence. The Flyers jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead behind young goalie Carter Hart, who recorded two consecutive shutouts in Games 3 and 4. Montreal won Game 5 to extend their season, but the Flyers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round against the New York Islanders, the Flyers fell behind 3\u20131 in the series partially due to lack of production from the top two lines. The Flyers would rally to tie the series with an overtime win in Game 5 and a double-overtime win in Game 6, but the Islanders shut out the Flyers 4\u20130 in Game 7 to end their season.\n\n\nDespite having lost in the playoffs, the team had very high expectations entering the 2020\u201321 season. The NHL did not begin the season until January 13, 2021, due to the ongoing global pandemic. NHL divisions would be temporarily realigned due to travel restrictions, placing the Flyers in the East Division.[51] The team managed to finish the first month of play tied for first place in the league, with a 7\u20132\u20131 record. However things began to unravel as the season continued. The team fell out of playoff contention by early March and would finish the season with the most goals scored against in the league. Management vowed to address the issues the team had suffered during the season by making several trades and free agent signings. On July 17, 2021, the team traded Nolan Patrick and Philippe Myers to the Nashville Predators in exchange for defenceman Ryan Ellis.[52] The following week the team traded for defenceman Rasmus Ristolainen from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Robert H\u00e4gg, a 2021 first round pick, and a 2023 second round pick; and traded Jakub Vor\u00e1\u010dek to the Columbus Blue Jackets for forward Cam Atkinson.[53][54] The team also signed veteran defenceman Keith Yandle, back up goalie Martin Jones and forward Derick Brassard to short term deals.[55][56]\n\n\nThe Flyers began the 2021\u201322 season off to a steady pace by winning six out of the first ten games of the season, however once again things would start to fall apart for the team. Newly acquired Ryan Ellis was placed on injured reserved on November 16 and would be out for the remainder of the season, due to a lower body injury sustained in the preseason.[57] The team then went on a ten game losing streak at which point Alain Vigneault was fired from head coaching duties following a 7\u20131 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning, and replaced by assistant coach Mike Yeo.[58] The team would show a brief sign of resurgence under Yeo before the team collapsed again by losing a franchise record thirteen games in a row.[59] In early February center Sean Couturier was ruled out for the rest of the season after completing back surgery for an injury sustained earlier in the year.[60] On March 17, longtime Flyers captain Claude Giroux played in his 1,000th career NHL game, a 5\u20134 home victory over the Nashville Predators, becoming the second Flyer in history to play 1000 games with the franchise.[61] On March 19, Giroux was traded along with Connor Bunnaman, German Rubtsov and a 2024 fifth-round pick to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Owen Tippett, a 2024 first-round draft pick, and a 2023 third-round pick.[62] The team finished the season with the fourth worst record in the league going 25\u201346\u201311, failing to make the playoffs.\n\n\nJohn Tortorella was hired as the team's new head coach, signing a four year contract.[63] Before the beginning of the 2022-23 season it was announced that Ryan Ellis would once again sit out for the season with a possible career ending injury.[64] To make matters worse it was announced soon after that Sean Couturier would require a second back surgery and also be forced to sit out for the entire season.[65] The team would once again have a modest start to the season by finishing the month of October with an 8-4-2 record. However the team was unable to capitalize on their early momentum and fell in the standings with a ten game winless streak in the month of November. On March 10, general manager Chuck Fletcher was fired and assistant general manager Daniel Briere was named interim general manager.[66] The team finished the season with a record of 31\u201338\u201313, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive year.\n\n\nAfter the season ended the organization began a complete overhaul of the front office. On May 11, 2023 the team hired former Flyer Keith Jones as president of hockey operations and named Daniel Briere as the general manager of the team.[67] Soon after the team fired longtime player development coaches Kjell Samuelsson and John Riley, as well as senior advisor Mike O'Connell.[68]\n\n\n\n## Logo and jerseys[edit]\n\n\n### Colors, name and logo[edit]\n\n\nOn April 4, 1966, Bill Putnam \u2013 a member of the Philadelphia group that was selected by the NHL for one of the six new franchises \u2013 announced a name-the-team contest and orange, black and white as the team colors.[69][70] Wanting what he referred to as \"hot\" colors, Putnam's choice was influenced by the orange and white of his alma mater \u2013 the University of Texas at Austin \u2013 and the orange and black of Philadelphia's previous NHL team, the Quakers.[70] Also announced on April 4 was the hiring of a Chicago firm to design the team's arena.\n\n\n\n![](image)Flyers logo since the team's inception in 1967\nDetails of the name-the-team contest were released on July 12, 1966.[70] Ballots were available at local Acme Markets grocery stores \u2013 sponsor of the contest.[70] The top prize was an RCA 21\" color television, with two season tickets for both the second- and third-prize winners, and a pair of single-game tickets for the next 100 winners.[70] Among the names considered behind the scenes were Quakers, Ramblers and Liberty Bells. The first two were the names of previous Philadelphia hockey teams and \u2013 given the connotations of losing (Quakers) and the minor leagues (Ramblers) \u2013 were passed over. Liberty Bells, although seriously considered, was also the name of a local race track. Bashers, Blizzards, Bruisers, Huskies, Keystones, Knights, Lancers, Raiders and Sabres were among the other names considered.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flyers wordmark, used 1967\u20132016\n![](image)Flyers wordmark used since 2016\nIt was Ed Snider's sister Phyllis who named the team when she suggested \"Flyers\" on a return trip from a Broadway play.[70] Ed knew immediately it would be the winning name, since it captured the speed of the game and went well phonetically with Philadelphia.[70] On August 3, 1966, the team name was announced.[70] Of the 11,000 ballots received, more than 100 selected Flyers as the team name and were entered into a drawing to select a winner.[70] Alec Stockard, a nine-year-old boy from Narberth, Pennsylvania, who had spelled it \"Fliers\" on his entry, won the drawing and was declared the winner.[70]\n\n\nWith the name and colors already known, Philadelphia advertising firm Mel Richmann Inc. was hired to design a logo and jersey.[70] With Tom Paul as head of the project, artist Sam Ciccone designed both the logo and jerseys to represent speed.[70] Ciccone's winged \"P\" design \u2013 four stylized wings attached to a slanted \"P\" with an orange dot to represent a puck \u2013 was considered the \"obvious choice\" over his other designs, which included a winged skate.[70] Ciccone's jersey design, a stripe down each shoulder and down the arms, represented wings.[70] The flying \"P\" has remained the same since the beginning and was ranked the sixth-best NHL logo in a 2008 *Hockey News* poll.[71] The Flyers unveiled a 3D version of this logo with metallic accents during the 2002\u201303 season which was used on orange third jerseys until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\n\n\n\n### Jerseys[edit]\n\n\nAs with his logo design, Ciccone's jersey design was meant to represent speed.[70] The home jersey was orange with a white stripe down each shoulder and down the arms (meant to represent wings)[70] with a white number on the back and black sleeve numbers. The away jersey was white with orange striping, an orange number on the back and white sleeve numbers. Other than a few minor alterations to the numbers and the switch the NHL made to wear white at home and dark on the road for 1970\u201371, this general design was used until the end of the 1981\u201382 season.\n\n\nThe Flyers unveiled second-generation jerseys for the 1982\u201383 season. The main difference was the increased width of the shoulder and arm stripes with black trim added to the border of the stripes. Also, a pinstripe (black for the white jersey, orange for the dark) was added to the bottom of each sleeve. With the exception of a similarly designed black jersey replacing the orange and the NHL switching back to wearing darks at home and whites on the road prior to 2003\u201304, this design was used until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\n\n\nMany NHL teams started using third jerseys during the mid-1990s and the Flyers unveiled a black third jersey that was similar in design to their second-generation jerseys during the 1997\u201398 season. During the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, the black jersey became the primary dark jersey with the orange jersey being retired after the 2000\u201301 season (although it was worn for one final game early in the following season on Halloween night). In 2002\u201303, a new orange third jersey was introduced which was a radical departure from any jersey the Flyers had used before. Unique striping and fonts were used along with the aforementioned metallic 3D logo and the first use of a color other than orange, black or white on a Flyers jersey \u2013 silver/gray. These jerseys were used until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\n\n\nThe Flyers, along with the rest of the NHL, unveiled new Rbk Edge jerseys prior to the 2007\u201308 season. The black jersey featured white shoulders with orange and black sections at the elbow and black cuffs. The white road jersey featured orange shoulders with black and white sections at the elbow, and black cuffs.[72] The Flyers unveiled a new orange third jersey based on their 1973\u201374 jerseys during the 2008\u201309 season, featuring white player nameplates with black letters which were used occasionally during that season.[73] This uniform replaced the black jerseys as the primary home jersey during the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs and the subsequent 2009\u201310 season. The team wore the 1973\u201374 white jersey \u2013 reverse of their current home uniform but with a black nameplate with white lettering \u2013 at the 2010 NHL Winter Classic versus the Boston Bruins at Fenway Park. For the 2010\u201311 season, the Winter Classic jersey was adopted as the team's primary road jersey and the team's alternate black jersey was retired.\n\n\nIn January 2012, for their second Winter Classic appearance \u2013 this time against their arch-rivals the New York Rangers at Citizens Bank Park \u2013 the Flyers wore a traditional sweater design in orange with cream and black trim, featuring a cream nameplate with black lettering, as well as black numbers. It also contained a neck tie string which no other Flyers jersey has had before it. This design was later adopted as a third jersey for the 2014\u201315 season.\n\n\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers retired their Winter Classic third jerseys in favor of a commemorative 50th-anniversary jersey. The uniform is white with orange and black striping, along with gold numbers, black nameplate with white lettering bordered in gold, and the classic Flyers logo with gold borders. The franchise's founding season is inscribed on the neckline.\n\n\nThe Flyers wore a black uniform for the 2017 NHL Stadium Series, featuring enlarged black numbers with white trim, orange striping on the sleeves and tail, and orange nameplate with black lettering. The said uniform will become the team's third uniform option starting in the 2018\u201319 season.\n\n\nDuring the 2019 NHL Stadium Series, the Flyers wore orange and black uniforms minus the white elements. The black helmets also featured an enlarged Flyers logo on both sides.\n\n\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Flyers released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The design was a callback to the darker burnt orange jersey they wore from 1982 to 2001; however, the white and black colors on the sleeves and numbers were reversed. In the 2022\u201323 season, the Flyers' \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was based on their early 1980s uniforms, but with black and orange relegated to the logo and lower sleeves.\n\n\nThe Flyers unveiled a new uniform design ahead of the 2023\u201324 season, reverting to the burnt orange shade they wore with the 1984\u20132007 uniforms. This design featured wider shoulder and sleeve stripes, single-colored sleeve numbers (black on the home uniform, white on the road uniform), and a black bottom stripe, all of which were visual nods to previous Flyers uniforms. The contrasting nameplate was also retained. The black alternate first used in the 2017 Stadium Series was also kept in circulation.[1]\n\n\n\n### Cooperall pants[edit]\n\n\nThe Flyers were the first and one of only two NHL teams (the Hartford Whalers being the other) to wear Cooperalls, hockey pants that extend from the waist to the ankles, in 1981\u201382. They wore them the following season as well, but returned to the traditional hockey pants in 1983\u201384 due to Cooperalls being banned from the NHL for safety reasons.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Gritty\n\nThe Flyers debuted a short-lived skating mascot named \"Slapshot\" in 1976 but dropped the character by the next season. It was the only mascot in Flyers' team history until 2018, although the team did occasionally employ the services of \"Phlex\", the then-mascot of the team's minor-league affiliate Philadelphia Phantoms (1996\u20132009), who became the Adirondack Phantoms (2009\u20132014) and are now re-branded the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, playing in the PPL Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2018, the Flyers introduced their new mascot, \"Gritty\", a seven-foot tall, fuzzy orange creature.[74]\n\n\n\n## Players and personnel[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n* view\n*

an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame, including 13 former players and six builders of the sport. The six individuals recognized as builders by the Hall of Fame includes former general managers, head coaches, and owners.[148] Inducted in 1984, Bernie Parent was the first Flyers-affiliated player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.[148]\n\n\nIn addition to players and builders, members of Philadelphia's sports media have also been recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1997, Gene Hart, a sports announcer for the Flyers, received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame for his contributions to hockey broadcasting.[149] In 2013, Jay Greenberg of the *Philadelphia Daily News* was awarded the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for his work in hockey journalism.[150]\n\n\n**Players**\n\n\n\n* Bill Barber\n* Bobby Clarke\n* Paul Coffey\n* Peter Forsberg\n* Dale Hawerchuk\n* Mark Howe\n* Eric Lindros\n* Adam Oates\n* Bernie Parent\n* Chris Pronger\n* Mark Recchi\n* Darryl Sittler\n* Allan Stanley\n\n**Builders**\n\n\n\n* Keith Allen\n* Ken Hitchcock\n* Roger Neilson\n* Bud Poile\n* Pat Quinn\n* Fred Shero\n* Ed Snider\n\n#### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of NHL retired numbers\n\n![](image)Raising of the no. 88 banner in honor of Eric Lindros\nThe Flyers have retired six of their jersey numbers and taken others out of circulation.

Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry\n\nAlso known as the Battle of Pennsylvania, the Flyers-Penguins rivalry is considered by many to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NHL. Both teams entered the league in 1967 with the Flyers finding success in the league early on while the Penguins struggled in the early years. The Flyers record against the Penguins from 1967 to 1989 was 89\u201336\u201319, and most notably during this time the Penguins had a 42 game winless streak at the Spectrum, lasting from 1974 until 1989. The two teams met for the first time in the playoffs in the 1989 Patrick Division Finals, where the Flyers defeated the higher seeded Penguins in seven games. The teams faced each other again in the 1997 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, with the Flyers winning the series in five games. Penguins legend Mario Lemieux decided to retire at the end of the series for the first time and left the ice to a standing ovation in Philadelphia after game five. The Flyers would go on to win over the Penguins again in the 2000 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, most remembered for Keith Primeau scoring the game winning goal in the fifth overtime period of game four, becoming the third longest playoff game in league history with a total game time of 152 minutes. The Penguins first playoff victory against the Flyers came during the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals, winning the series in five games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. The two teams would meet again in the playoffs the following year in the 2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, with the Penguins defeating the Flyers in six games. The rivalry would come to a boiling point during the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals when both teams combined for an NHL record 45 goals in the first four games of a playoff series, as well as accumulating 309 penalty minutes. Game three saw a total combined 158 penalty minutes between the two teams, as well as multiple suspensions. The Flyers went on to win the series in six games. The Penguins defeated the Flyers in the first round of the 2018 playoffs in six games, with the Penguins outscoring the Flyers 28\u201315. The rivalry has been showcased during the NHL Stadium Series outdoor games in 2017 at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh and in 2019 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Washington Capitals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Capitals\u2013Flyers rivalry\n\n## Radio and television[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Philadelphia Flyers broadcasters\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lehigh Valley Phantoms\n* List of NHL statistical leaders\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* Sports in Philadelphia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \\*Clarence S.
