Due to limited arable land, livestock raising is the primary occupation mainly on the Tibetan Plateau, among them are sheep, cattle, goats, camels, yaks, donkeys and horses. The main crops grown are barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, potatoes, oats, rapeseeds, cotton and assorted fruits and vegetables. In recent years the economy has begun evolving into a multiple structure with agriculture and tertiary industry developing side by side.\n\n\n\n\n## Growth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in Bill.Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 5.61\n |\n| 2000\n | 11.78\n |\n| 2005\n | 24.88\n |\n| 2010\n | 50.75\n |\n| 2015\n | 102.64\n |\n| 2020\n | 190.27\n |\n| Source:[1] |\n\n\nFrom the 1951 Seventeen Point Agreement to 2003, life expectancy in Tibet increased from thirty-six years to sixty-seven years with infant mortality and absolute poverty declining steadily.[2] Professor Lin Chun summarizes, \"Roads, factories, schools, hospitals, and above all, modern conceptions of equality and citizenship, however undemocratic they might be, had transformed the land of snows where the cruelty and hardship of an ancient serfdom had been evident.\"[3]\n\n\nTibet's GDP in 2008 was 39.6 billion renminbi yuan.[4] The Chinese government says that it exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditure. Critics say that the central government in Beijing are stripping Tibetan resources and neglecting the welfare of Tibetan people.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Tibetan farmer ploughing a field; yaks still provide the best way to plow fields in Tibet\nAccording to the Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qiangba Puncog, Tibet's economy has grown on average 12% per year from 2000 to 2006. The per capita GDP reached 10,000 RMB in 2006 for the first time in Tibet's history.[6]\n\n\nIn the first six months of 2008, economic growth in Tibet was halved after the Lhasa riots led to a slump in tourism, consumption and output. The region’s economy expanded 7.4 percent in the period from 2007, down from 14.7 percent in the year-earlier period.[7]\n\n\n\n### Chinese development efforts[edit]\n\n\nThe Chinese government allocates yearly economic and financial aid packages to the Tibet Autonomous Region, an amount that academic Lin Chun of the London School of Economics and Political Science characterizes as \"enormous.\"[3] China's most recent Five Year Plan includes nearly USD $30 billion in Tibetan transportation infrastructure funding.[8]\n\n\nFrom January 18–20, 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by CPC Politburo Standing Committee members: Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang signaling the commitment of senior Chinese leaders to development of Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas. The plan calls for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. The Chinese government has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001. \"Tibet's GDP was expected to reach 43.7 billion yuan in 2009, up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years.\"[9] Outside observers credited increased interest in Tibet to concern over Tibetan nationalism which resulted in ethnic unrest in 2008.[10]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMany factories have been established in the Tibet Autonomous Region since 1959, but industrial development has had a long and prosperous history. The government initially tried to follow the industrial structure and development plans of other regions, while ignoring the actual situation in the TAR (scarcity of fuel, high transport costs, inexperienced local labour, etc.). There was no modern industry or infrastructure before the 1950s and people's life-styles and work habits were very different from those of industrial societies. Many plants rapidly became financially unprofitable and a drain on the government. The value of industrial output of state enterprises first rose to 141.7 million yuan in 1960, and fell to 11.2 million yuan in 1968.[11]\n\n\nWith some adjustments, the value of industrial output rose again in the late 1980s. Moreover, as in the rest of China, the ownership structure of industrial enterprises in the TAR also experienced a major change. In 2007, for a “gross industrial output value” totaling 5,044 million yuan, 33,1% came from state enterprises, 5.6% from collectively-owned enterprises and 61.3% from \"others\" (private companies, joint ventures and foreign companies). Thus, private enterprise is now the main source of growth in industrial production.[12]\n\n\nAccording to the White Paper published by the central government in 2009 to mark the Fiftieth Anniversary of the \"Democratic Reform in Tibet,\" a modern Tibetan industry has developed with mining, construction materials, handicrafts and Tibetan medicine as pillar industries, and power generation, processing of agricultural products and livestock and food production as auxiliary. The industrial added value rose by 15 million yuan in 1959 to 2,968,000,000 yuan in 2008. Modern commerce, tourism, catering, leisure and other industries that had never been heard of in old Tibet, are now booming as the primary industries in the region. Petroleum, natural gas, and rubber also play a large role in Tibet's annual exports.\n[13]\n\n\n\n### Traditional handicrafts[edit]\n\n\nThe rapid economic development of the T.A.R. has brought about a revival of traditional handicrafts. Many Tibetans today draw a significant part of their income from selling handicraft and cultural products to tourists, or even to other Tibetans.[14]\n\n\nFounded in 1953,[15] the state carpet-making factory in Lhasa has turned into a modern enterprise whose products are sold in Europe, North America and South Asia.[16]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years Tibet's tourism has expanded rapidly, especially after the completion of Qingzang Railway in July 2006. Tibet received 2.5 million tourists in 2006, including 150,000 foreigners.[6]\n\n\nIn 2007, the figure climbed to some 4 million visitors but fell to only 2,246,400 in 2008[17] \non account of the region being closed to tourism from March till June.\n\n\nBetween January and July 2009, more than 2.7 million tourists visited the TAR, three times as many as for the same period in 2008,[18] generating an income of 2.29 billion yuans.[19]\n\n\nIn 2010, the region received 6.85 million tourists from home and abroad, generating revenues of 7.14 billion yuan, 14 percent of its total GDP.[20]\n\n\nBetween January 1 and November 30, 2012, the T.A.R. received a record 10 million domestic and foreign tourists, as against more than 8.69 million visitors in 2011. Nearly 300,000 people are employed in the region's tourism sector, according to government figures.[21]\n\n\n\n## Agriculture[edit]\n\n\n### Agricultural pests[edit]\n\n\n*Plutella xylostella* is a pest almost everywhere cruciferous vegetables are grown, including the Plateau.[22] The various weedy forms of *Cannabis* which have now spread worldwide originated on the northeast edge of the Plateau, in Tibet and Qinghai.[23] Tibetan populations of *Locusta migratoria* show adaptations which allow them to respond better to hypoxia.[24] Overall Tibet has been invaded by fewer agricultural insect threats, mostly because of its lack of sea access. Coastal economic expansion has allowed for invasions to occur, but as Tibet also begins to grow economically, it too may suffer the same fate.[25]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Historical GDP of Provinces \"Home - Regional - Annual by Province\" (Press release).

Private investment and exports are the main drivers of economic growth in China; but the Chinese government has also emphasized domestic consumption.[36]\n\n\nChina is the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods.[37] It is also the world's fastest-growing consumer market and second-largest importer of goods.[38] China is also the world's largest consumer of numerous commodities, and accounts for about half of global consumption of metals.[39] China is a net importer of services products.[40] It is the largest trading nation in the world and plays a prominent role in international trade.[41][42] China is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world as of 2020, receiving inflows of $163 billion.[43] It has the second largest outward foreign direct investment, at US$136.91 billion for 2019 alone, following Japan at US$226.65 billion for the same period.[44] As of 2022, China was second in the world in total number of billionaires.[45] In 2018, it was second in millionaires with 3.5 million.[46] According to the 2019 Global Wealth Report by Credit Suisse Group, China surpassed the US in the wealth of the top ten percent of the world's population.[47][note 5] China has the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $3.1 trillion,[48] but if the foreign assets of China's state-owned commercial banks are included, the value of China's reserves rises to nearly $4 trillion.[49] China faced a mild economic slowdown during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and initiated a massive stimulus package, which helped to regain its economic growth.\n\n\nWith 778 million workers, the Chinese labor force was the world's largest as of 2020. It ranks 28th on the Global Competitiveness Report.[50] Per the Global Innovation Index in 2022, China was ranked 11th in the world, 3rd in Asia & Oceania region and 2nd for countries with a population of over 100 million. It is the only middle-income economy and the only newly industrialized economy in the top 30.[51][52] It is often ranked among the world's most innovative countries, leading several measures of global patent filings.[53][54] China has the second-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $17.9 trillion as of 2021.[55] It also has two (Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing in the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively) of the global top 5 science and technology clusters, which is more than any other country.[51][56] As of March 2022, China has over 500 million 5G users and 1.45 million base stations installed.[57][58] Almost 493 million Chinese people are categorized as middle class, and 242 million are upper middle class, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey.[59] In 2022, mainland China's ten largest trading partners were European Union, United States, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, and Russia.[60]\n\n\nChina has free trade agreements with many nations, some of which are already in force (such as RCEP, the largest trade bloc in history) or are still in the negotiation phase.[61] Although widely regarded as the \"powerhouse of manufacturing\" or \"the factory of the world\",[62] exports contribute only a comparatively small proportion of the Chinese economy, at just 18.5% in 2020. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 142 are headquartered in China.[63] It has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers[64] and three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (both by market capitalization and by trade volume).[65] China's economy is both a contributor to rising global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions causing climate change and severely affected by its adverse impacts, although its per capita emissions are still much lower than developed economies such as the United States.[66]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economic history of China before 1912, Economic history of China (1912–1949), and Economic history of China (1949–present)\n\n![](image)GDP per capita in China from 1000 to 2018\nHistorically, China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.[34][67][68][69][70] China accounted for around one-quarter of the global GDP until the late 1700s and approximately one-third of the global GDP in 1820 as the Industrial Revolution was beginning in Great Britain.[71][72][73][74] China's GDP in 1820 was six times as large as Britain's, the largest economy in Europe – and almost twenty times the GDP of the nascent United States.[75]\n\n\nAt the end of the Chinese Civil War, the economy was devastated.[76] As the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan, they stripped China of liquid assets including gold, silver, and the country's dollar reserves.[76] By the time the KMT was defeated, commerce had been destroyed, the national currency rendered valueless, and the economy was based on barter.[76]\n\n\nThe People's Republic of China's development from one of the poorest countries to one of the largest economies was the quickest of any country.[77]: 11 From 1949 until the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the economy was state-led with market activity remaining underground.[78] Economic reforms began under Deng Xiaoping.[78] China subsequently became the world's fastest-growing major economy, with growth rates averaging 10% over 30 years.[79][80] Many scholars consider the Chinese economic model as an example of authoritarian capitalism,[81][82] state capitalism[83] or party-state capitalism.[84][85]\n\n\nChina has sustained growth due to export relations, its manufacturing sector, and low-wage workers.[6] China's was the only major world economy to experience GDP growth in 2020, when its GDP increased by 2.3%.[86] However, it posted one of its worst economic performances in decades because of COVID-19 in 2022.[87] In 2023, IMF predicted China to continue being one of the fastest growing major economies.[88]\n\n\n\n## Wealth in China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP, List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita, and List of Chinese prefecture-level cities by GDP per capita\n\nChina has had the world's largest middle class population since 2015,[89] and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018[*citation needed*] and is projected to reach 1.2 billion by 2027, making up one fourth of the world total.[90] As of 2018, China was first in the world in total number of billionaires and second in millionaires – there were 658 Chinese billionaires[91] and 3.5 million millionaires.[92] In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[93][94] In other words, as of 2019, a hundred million Chinese are in the top ten percent of the wealthiest individuals in the world – those who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000.[95] In 2020, China has the world's highest number of billionaires, which is more than the US and India combined,[96] and as of March 2021, the number of billionaires in China reach 1,058 with the combined wealth of US$4.5 trillion.[97] According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, China is home to six of the world's top ten cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Hangzhou and Guangzhou in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more than any other country.[97] As of January 2021, China had 85 female billionaires, two-thirds of the global total.[98]\n\n\n\n## Regional economies for China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Megalopolises in China and List of cities in China\n\n![](image)Distribution of GDP in mainland China\nChina's unequal transportation system, combined with important differences in the availability of natural and human resources and in industrial infrastructure, has produced significant variations in the regional economies of China.[99]\n\n\nEconomic development has generally been more rapid in coastal provinces than in the interior and there are large disparities in per capita income between regions. The three wealthiest regions are the Yangtze River Delta in East China; the Pearl River Delta in South China; and Jingjinji region in North China. It is the rapid development of these areas that is expected to have the most significant effect on the Asian regional economy as a whole and Chinese government policy is designed to remove the obstacles to accelerated growth in these wealthier regions. By 2035, China's four cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) are projected to be among the global top ten largest cities by nominal GDP according to a report by Oxford Economics.[100]\n\n\n\n### GDP by administrative division[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP\n\n\n\n\nList of 31 provinces in mainland China by Nominal GDP in 2022 (billions of GDP)[3]\n| provinces | CN¥ | US$ | share (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China(mainland) | 121,020.72 | 17,992.70 | 100\n |\n| Guangdong | 12,911.86 | 1,919.67 | 10.67\n |\n| Jiangsu | 12,287.56 | 1,826.85 | 10.15\n |\n| Shandong | 8,743.51 | 1,299.94 | 7.22\n |\n| Zhejiang | 7,771.54 | 1,155.43 | 6.42\n |\n| Henan | 6,134.51 | 912.05 | 5.07\n |\n| Sichuan | 5,674.98 | 843.73 | 4.69\n |\n| Hubei | 5,373.49 | 798.90 | 4.44\n |\n| Fujian | 5,310.99 | 789.61 | 4.39\n |\n| Hunan | 4,867.04 | 723.61 | 4.02\n |\n| Anhui | 4,504.50 | 669.70 | 3.72\n |\n| Shanghai | 4,465.28 | 663.87 | 3.69\n |\n| Hebei | 4,237.04 | 629.94 | 3.50\n |\n| Beijing | 4,161.10 | 618.65 | 3.44\n |\n| Shaanxi | 3,277.27 | 487.25 | 2.71\n |\n| Jiangxi | 3,207.47 | 476.87 | 2.65\n |\n| Chongqing | 2,912.90 | 433.07 | 2.41\n |\n| Liaoning | 2,897.51 | 430.79 | 2.39\n |\n| Yunnan | 2,895.42 | 430.48 | 2.39\n |\n| Guangxi | 2,630.09 | 391.03 | 2.17\n |\n| Shanxi | 2,564.26 | 381.24 | 2.12\n |\n| Inner Mongolia | 2,315.87 | 344.31 | 1.91\n |\n| Guizhou | 2,016.46 | 299.80 | 1.67\n |\n| Xinjiang | 1,774.13 | 263.77 | 1.47\n |\n| Tianjin | 1,631.13 | 242.51 | 1.35\n |\n| Heilongjiang | 1,590.10 | 236.41 | 1.31\n |\n| Jilin | 1,307.02 | 194.32 | 1.08\n |\n| Gansu | 1,120.16 | 166.54 | 0.93\n |\n| Hainan | 681.82 | 101.37 | 0.56\n |\n| Ningxia | 506.96 | 75.37 | 0.42\n |\n| Qinghai | 361.01 | 53.67 | 0.30\n |\n| Tibet | 213.26 | 31.71 | 0.18\n |\n\n\n### Hong Kong and Macau[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Hong Kong and Economy of Macau\n\nIn accordance with the one country, two systems policy, the economies of the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portuguese colony of Macau formally preserve a capitalist system separate from mainland China.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of administrative divisions of Greater China by Human Development Index\n\n![](image)China and other major developing economies by GDP per capita at purchasing-power parity (1990–2013) as the rapid economic growth of China (blue) is readily apparent[103]\nThe economic reforms implemented in 1978 helped to propel China into the ranks of the world's major economic powers. The economic development of Shenzhen has caused the city to be referred to as the world's next Silicon Valley.[104][105] The provinces in the coastal regions of China, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong, tend to be more industrialized while regions in the hinterland are less developed.\n\n\n\n![](image)China vs World by Nominal GDP per capita in 2020[106]\nTo guide economic development, the Chinese central government adopts \"five-year plans\" that detail its economic priorities and essential policies. The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) is currently being implemented, placing an emphasis on consumption-driven growth and technological self-sufficiency while China transitions from being an upper middle-income economy to a high-income economy.[107]\n\n\nThe public sector plays a central role in China's economy.[108] This development is also in line with the planning goals of the Chinese central government to achieve the \"Two Centenaries\", namely the material goal of China becoming a \"moderately prosperous society in all respects\" by 2021 and the modernization goal of China becoming a \"strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and modern socialist country\" by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.[109] China retains state control over the commanding heights of the economy in key industries like infrastructure, telecommunications, and finance despite significant marketization of the economy since reform and opening up.[110]: 20 Specific mechanisms implementing its control of the commanding heights in these areas include public property rights, pervasive administrative involvement, and Communist Party supervision of senior managers.[110]: 20\n\n\n\n![](image)Worlds regions by total wealth (in trillions USD), 2018\n![](image)China's share of global export 1990–2019\nLike Japan and South Korea before it, China's economy has grown rapidly, raising the income levels and living standards of its citizens while producing goods that are consumed globally. China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[111][112]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.[113] Between 1981 and 2019, the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty decreased from 88.1% to 0.2%.[5] Its current account surplus increased by a factor of 53 between 1982 and 2021, from $5.67 billion to $317 billion.[114] During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like clothing and footwear to the increasingly sophisticated production of computers, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. China's factories generated $3.7 trillion real manufacturing value added, more than the US, South Korea, Germany and the UK combined. China's manufacturing sector benefits from the world's largest domestic market, immense manufacturing scale, and highly developed manufacturing supply chains.[115]\n\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing. The measures included plans to build a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the Yangtze River.[116]\n\n\nIn terms of domestic saving, defined as combined saving of households, businesses, and governments, China is the world's largest saving country as of at least 2022.[117]: 27\n\n\n\n### Disputes over economic data[edit]\n\n\nThere exists disputes over reliability of official economic data. Foreign and some Chinese sources have claimed that official Chinese government statistics overstate China's economic growth.[118] However, several Western academics and institutions have stated that China's economic growth is higher than indicated by official figures.[119] Others, such as the Economist Intelligence Unit, state that while there's evidence China's GDP data is \"smoothed\", they believe that China's nominal and real GDP data are broadly accurate.[120]\n\n\n\n#### Overestimating[edit]\n\n\nChinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking their numbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose performance are often assessed based on how well their respective economies have performed.[121] Local governments have come under increased scrutiny over the last few years over economic data, with CCP general secretary Xi Jinping stating that economic data forgery \"not only hurt our judgment of the economic situation, but also seriously undermined the Communist Party’s ideas and truth-seeking style\".[118][122]\n\n\nA 2015 survey by *The Wall Street Journal* of 64 select economists found that 96% of respondents think China's GDP estimates don't \"accurately reflect the state of the Chinese economy.\"[123] However, more than half the economists in the survey estimated that China's annual growth was somewhere in the 5% to 7% range, which represents robust growth. During his tenure in Liaoning, future Chinese premier Li Keqiang has said he is far from confident in the country's GDP estimates, calling them \"man-made\" and unreliable, according to a leaked document from 2007 obtained by WikiLeaks. He said government data releases, especially the GDP numbers, should be used \"for reference only\".[124]\n\n\nIn 2016, analysts like Wilbur Ross and Donald Straszheim believed China's economic growth had been overstated, and estimate a growth rate at around 4% or less.[125] According to Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Michael Zheng Song, an economics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and coauthors, China's economy was smaller than what the Chinese government stated in 2016. In their research paper, published by the Brookings Institution in 2019, they adjusted the historical GDP time series using value-added tax data, which they said are \"highly resistant to fraud and tampering\".[126][127] They found that China's economic growth may have been overstated by 1.7 percent each year between 2008 and 2016, meaning that the government may have been overstating the size of the Chinese economy by 12–16 percent in 2016.[127][128]\n\n\n\n#### Underestimating[edit]\n\n\nSeveral Western academics and institutions have supported the claim that China's economy is likely to be underestimated.[129][130][131][119][132][133][134] A paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research claimed that China's economic growth may be higher than what is reported by official statistics.[135] An article by Hunter Clarka, Maxim Pinkovskiya and Xavier Sala-i-Martin published by the Elsevier Science Direct in 2018 employs an innovative method of satellite-recorded nighttime lights, which the authors claim to be a best-unbiased predictor of the economic growth in Chinese cities. The results suggest that the Chinese economic growth rate is higher than the official reported data.[129]\n\n\nThe Li Keqiang index is an alternative measurement of Chinese economic performance that uses three variables Li preferred.[136] Satellite measurements of light pollution are used by some analysts to model Chinese economic growth and suggest growth rate numbers in Chinese official data are more reliable, though are likely to be smoothed.[137] According to an article by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, China's official statistics are of a high quality compared to other developing, middle-income and low-income countries. In 2016, China was at the 83rd percentile of middle and low-income countries, up from the 38th percentile in 2004.[138] A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that China's official GDP statistics are \"significantly and positively correlated\" with externally verifiable measures of economic activity such as import and export data from China's trade partners, suggesting that China's economic growth was no slower than the official figures indicated.[119]\n\n\nThe study by Daniel Rosen and Beibei Bao, published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2015, showed that GDP in 2008 was actually 13–16 percent bigger than the official data, while 2013 GDP was accurately at $10.5 trillion rather than the official figure at $9.5 trillion.[132] According to a research conducted by Arvind Subramanian, a former economist at the International Money Fund (IMF) and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the size of the Chinese economy by Purchasing Power Parity in 2010 was about $14.8 trillion rather than an official estimate at $10.1 trillion by IMF, meaning that China's GDP was underestimated by 47 percent.[139]\n\n\n\n### Regional development[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |  | The East Coast(w/ existing development programmes) |\n|  |  | \"Rise of Central China\"\n |\n|  |  | \"Revitalize Northeast China\"\n |\n|  |  | \"China Western Development\"\n |\n\n\nThese strategies are aimed at the relatively poorer regions in China in an attempt to prevent widening inequalities:\n\n\n\n* China Western Development, designed to increase the economic situation of the western provinces through investment and development of natural resources.\n* Revitalize Northeast China, to rejuvenate the industrial bases in Northeast China.

1987–2022\nDuring the winter of 2007–2008, inflation ran about 7% on an annual basis, rising to 8.7% in statistics for February 2008, released in March 2008.[141][142][143]\n\n\nShortages of gasoline and diesel fuel developed in the fall of 2007 due to reluctance of refineries to produce fuel at low prices set by the state. These prices were slightly increased in November 2007 with fuel selling for $2.65 a gallon, still slightly below world prices. Price controls were in effect on numerous basic products and services, but were ineffective with food, prices of which were rising at an annual rate of 18.2% in November 2007.[144][145] The problem of inflation has caused concern at the highest levels of the Chinese government. On 9 January 2008, the government issued the following statement on its official website: \"The Chinese government decided on Wednesday to take further measures to stabilize market prices and increase the severity of punishments for those guilty of driving up prices through hoarding or cheating.\"[146][147]\n\n\nPork is an important part of the Chinese economy with a per capita consumption of 90 grams per day. The worldwide rise in the price of animal feed associated with increased production of ethanol from corn resulted in steep rises in pork prices in China in 2007. Increased cost of production interacted badly with increased demand resulting from rapidly rising wages. The state responded by subsidizing pork prices for students and the urban poor and called for increased production. Release of pork from the nation's strategic pork reserve was considered.[148]\n\n\nBy January 2008, the inflation rate rose to 7.1%, which BBC News described as the highest inflation rate since 1997, due to the winter storms that month.[149] China's inflation rate jumped to a new decade high of 8.7 percent in February 2008 after severe winter storms disrupted the economy and worsened food shortages, the government said 11 March 2008.[150] Throughout the summer and fall, however, inflation fell again to a low of 6.6% in October 2008.[151]\n\n\nBy November 2010, the inflation rate rose up to 5.1%, driven by an 11.7% increase in food prices year on year. According to the bureau, industrial output went up 13.3 percent. As supplies have run short, prices for fuel and other commodities have risen.[152]\n\n\n\n### Investment cycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Financial Street\nChinese investment has always been highly cyclical.[153] Ever since the 1958 Great Leap Forward, growth in fixed capital formation has typically peaked about every five years. Peaks occurred in 1978, 1984, 1988, 1993, 2003 and 2009. The corresponding troughs were in 1981, 1986, 1989, 1997 and 2005.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn China, the majority of investment is carried out by entities that are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are under the control of local governments. Thus, booms are primarily the result of perverse incentives at the local-government level.[154] Unlike entrepreneurs in a free-enterprise economy, Chinese local officials are motivated primarily by political considerations. As their performance evaluations are based, to a large extent, on GDP growth within their jurisdictions, they have a strong incentive to promote large-scale investment projects.[155][156]\n\n\nA typical cycle begins with a relaxation of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions.[157] The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as was the case in 2003).[158] Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular types of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.[159]\n\n\n\n## Macroeconomic issues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese economic reform\n\n### Environmental transition[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental policy in China, Water supply and sanitation in China, and health in China\n\n![](image)Historical annual CO2 emissions for the top six countries and confederations\nOver the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure of certain commodities and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s.[160]\n\n\nBy 2010, rapidly rising wages and a general increase in the standard of living had put increased energy use on a collision course with the need to reduce carbon emissions in order to control global warming.[161] There were diligent efforts to increase energy efficiency and increase use of renewable sources; over 1,000 inefficient power plants had been closed, but projections continued to show a dramatic rise in carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.[162] Since the late 2010s, a reduction of state-backed subsidies has negatively impacted several Chinese companies, with BYD Auto being one of them.[163][164][165][166]\n\n\nWhile not the largest source of historical cumulative emissions, today China accounts for one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.[167] On a per capita basis, China's emissions in 2019 (9 tonnes CO2-equivalent [tCO2e] per year) surpass those of the European Union (7.6 tCO2e) but remain slightly below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average (10.7 tCO2e) and well below the United States average (17.6 tCO2e). However, the carbon intensity of China's GDP—the amount of carbon used to generate a unit of output—remains relatively high.[66] To avoid the long-term socioeconomic cost[168] of environmental pollution in China,[169][170] it has been suggested by Nicholas Stern and Fergus Green of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment that the economy of China be shifted to more advanced industrial development with low carbon dioxide emissions and better allocation of national resources to innovation and R&D for sustainable economic growth in order to reduce the impact of China's heavy industry. This is in accord with the planning goals of the central government.[171] Chinese leader and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream is described as achieving the \"Two Centenaries\", namely the material goal of China becoming a \"moderately prosperous society\" by 2021, and the modernization goal of China becoming a fully developed nation by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.[172]\n\n\n\n### National debt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National debt of China\n\nIn 2022, China's total government debt stood at approximately CN¥ 94 trillion (US$ 14 trillion), equivalent to about 77.1% of GDP.[140] In 2014, many analysts expressed concern over the overall size of China's government debt.[173][174][175][176] At the end of 2014, the International Monetary Fund reported that China's general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio was 41.44 percent.[177][178] In 2015, a report by the International Monetary Fund concluded that China's public debt is relatively low \"and on a stable path in all standard stress tests except for the scenario with contingent liability shocks\", such as \"a large-scale bank recapitalization or financial system bailout to deal, for example, with a potential rise in NPLs from deleveraging\".[179]\n\n\nChinese authorities have dismissed analysts' worries, insisting \"the country still has room to increase government debt.\"[180] Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, earlier in 2016, commented that \"the ... debt pile facing China [is] an 'internal' problem, given the majority of the borrowings was issued in local currency.[181] Many economists have expressed the same views as Bernanke.[182] A 2019 survey by the OECD found that China's corporate debt is higher than other major countries.[183]\n\n\n\"Shadow banking\" has risen in China, posing risks to the financial system.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Regulatory environment and government revenues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxation in China\n\nThough China's economy has expanded rapidly, its regulatory environment has not kept pace. Since Deng Xiaoping's open market reforms, the growth of new businesses has outpaced the government's ability to regulate them. This has created a situation where businesses, faced with mounting competition and poor oversight, take drastic measures to increase profit margins, often at the expense of consumer safety. This issue became more prominent in 2007, with a number of restrictions being placed on problematic Chinese exports by the United States.[186]\n\n\n\n## Financial and banking system[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China bond yields 30 year bond\n 10 year bond\n 2 year bond\n 1 year bond\n\nMain articles: Banking in China, Foreign-exchange reserves of China, Hedge fund industry in China, and China Venture Capital Association\n\nChina has the world's largest total banking sector assets of around $45.838 trillion (309.41 trillion CNY) with $42.063 trillion in total deposits and other liabilities.[187][188] Most of China's financial institutions are state-owned and governed.[189] The chief instruments of financial and fiscal control are the People's Bank of China (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance, both under the authority of the State Council. The People's Bank of China replaced the Central Bank of China in 1950 and gradually took over private banks. It fulfills many of the functions of other central and commercial banks. It issues the currency, controls circulation, and plays an important role in disbursing budgetary expenditures. Additionally, it administers the accounts, payments, and receipts of government organizations and other bodies, which enables it to exert thorough supervision over their financial and general performances in consideration of the government's economic plans. The PBC is also responsible for international trade and other overseas transactions. Remittances by overseas Chinese are managed by the Bank of China (BOC), which has a number of branch offices in several countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther financial institutions that are crucial, include the China Development Bank (CDB), which funds economic development and directs foreign investment; the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), which provides for the agricultural sector; the China Construction Bank (CCB), which is responsible for capitalizing a portion of overall investment and for providing capital funds for certain industrial and construction enterprises; and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which conducts ordinary commercial transactions and acts as a savings bank for the public.[*citation needed*] China initiated the founding of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015 and the Silk Road Fund in 2014, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[190]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)\nChina's economic reforms greatly increased the economic role of the banking system. In theory any enterprises or individuals can go to the banks to obtain loans outside the state plan, in practice, 75% of state bank loans go to State Owned Enterprises. (SOEs)[191] Even though nearly all investment capital was previously provided on a grant basis according to the state plan, policy has since the start of the reform shifted to a loan basis through the various state-directed financial institutions. It is estimated that, as of 2011, 14 trillion Yuan in loans was outstanding to local governments. Much of that total is believed by outside observers to be nonperforming.[192] Increasing amounts of funds are made available through the banks for economic and commercial purposes. Foreign sources of capital have also increased. China has received loans from the World Bank and several United Nations programs, as well as from countries (particularly Japan) and, to a lesser extent, commercial banks. Hong Kong has been a major conduit of this investment, as well as a source itself. On 23 February 2012, the PBC evinced its inclination to liberalize its capital markets when it circulated a telling ten-year timetable.[193] Following on the heels of this development, Shenzhen banks were able to launch cross-border yuan remittances for individuals, a significant shift in the PBC's capital control strictures since Chinese nationals had been previously barred from transferring their yuan to overseas account.[194]\n\n\nChina has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen), more than any other country.[64] China has three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen), both by market capitalization and by trade volume.[65][195] As of 12 October 2020, the total market capitalization of mainland Chinese stock markets, consisting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, topped US$10 trillion, excluding the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with about US$5.9 trillion.[196]\n\n\nAs of the end of June 2020, foreign investors had bought a total of US$440 billion in Chinese stocks, representing about 2.9% of the total value, and indicating that foreign investors scooped up a total of US$156.6 billion in the stocks just in the first half of 2020.[197] The total value of China's bond market topped US$15.4 trillion, ranked above that of Japan and the U.K., and second only to that of the U.S. with US$40 trillion, as of the beginning of September 2020.[198] As of the end of September 2020, foreign holdings of Chinese bonds reached US$388 billion, or 2.5%, of the total value, notwithstanding an increase by 44.66% year on year.[199]\n\n\n\n### Stock markets[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Composite Index 1991–2022\nChina's stock market exchanges include the Beijing Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (including the STAR Market), the Shenzen Stock Exchange, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. China's stock market is relatively underdeveloped compared to other aspects of its economy.[200]: 148–150\n\n\nTo be listed on China's stock exchange, companies must demonstrate good financial standing (including sustained profitability), solid corporate governance (for example, with a board of independent directors, supervisory board, auditing, and no history of misreporting or fraud) and have a market capitalization equivalent to at least US$4 million.[86]: 271–272\n\n\nWhen the stock markets re-opened in the PRC period in 1990, most of the listed companies were state-owned enterprises; this was part of an experiment in subjecting SOEs to market discipline.[200]: 152–153 The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were under municipal control and termed \"experimental points\" until 1997.[201]: 102–103 In 1997, the central government brought the exchanges under central government control and affirmed that the exchanges had a legitimate role in the socialist market economy.[201]: 102\n\n\nIn 2015, a stock market plunge in China eliminated $2 trillion of global stock market value.[200]: 147\n\n\n\n### Currency system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Renminbi\n\n![](image)USD/CNY exchange rate 1981–2022\nThe renminbi (\"people's currency\") is the currency of China, denominated as the yuan, subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. The ISO 4217 abbreviation is CNY, although also commonly abbreviated as \"RMB\". As of 2005, the yuan was generally considered by outside observers to be undervalued by about 30–40%.[202][203] However, in 2017, the IMF stated that the yuan was correctly valued.[204]\n\n\nThe renminbi is held in a floating exchange-rate system managed primarily against the US dollar. On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe rate of exchange (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's balance of trade, inflation, measured by the consumer price index and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's central bank has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.[205] An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.[206]\n\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.[207] The devaluation was accomplished by pegging the official rate to closing market rates. A market-based \"representative\" exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for designation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals.[208] Since the late-2000s, China has sought to internationalize the renminbi. As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most widely traded currency in the world.[209] In November 2015 in advance of G-20 and IMF meetings, IMF director Christine Lagarde announced her support for adding the yuan to the SDR currency basket. The announcement gave 'green-light' to official approval at 30 November IMF meeting.[210] The internationalization of the Chinese economy continues to affect the standardized economic forecast officially launched in China by the Purchasing Managers Index in 2005. As China's economy grows, so does China's Renminbi, which undergoes the process needed for its internationalization.[211]\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Fortune Global, of the world's 500 largest companies, 145 are headquartered in China.[212] As of 2022, China was home to 351 largest listed companies measured by revenue in the Fortune Global 2000, ranking second globally.[213] China is also home to more than two hundred privately held technology startups (tech unicorns), each with a valuation of over $1 billion, the highest number in the world.[214]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Virtually all arable land is used for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is among the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish. Major non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds, furnish China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high because of intensive cultivation, for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total, but China still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United States. China hopes to further increase agricultural production through improved plant stocks, fertilizers, and technology.\n\n\nAccording to the government statistics issued in 2005,[215] after a drop in the yield of farm crops in 2000, output has been increasing annually.\n\n\n\n![](image)Production of wheat from 1961 to 2004 (data from FAO in 2005, y-axis: production in metric tons)\nAccording to the United Nations World Food Program, in 2022, China fed eighteen percent of the world's population with only seven percent of the world's arable land.[216]\n\n\nAnimal husbandry constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the livestock output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of aquaculture. Pond raising has always been important and has been increasingly emphasized to supplement coastal and inland fisheries threatened by overfishing and to provide such valuable export commodities as prawns. China is also unmatched in the size and reach of its fishing armada with anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 boats, some as far afield as Argentina. Fueled primarily by government subsidies, its growth and activities have largely gone unchecked.[217]\n\n\n\n![](image)Timber transported from a woodlot in the hills of Zhangpu County, Fujian\nEnvironmental problems such as floods, drought, and erosion pose serious threats to farming in many parts of the country. The wholesale destruction of forests gave way to an energetic reforestation program that proved inadequate, and forest resources are still fairly meagre.[218] The principal forests are found in the Qin Mountains and the central mountains and on the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Because they are inaccessible, the Qinling forests are not worked extensively, and much of the country's timber comes from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, and Yunnan.\n\n\nWestern China, comprising Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, has little agricultural significance except for areas of floriculture and cattle raising. Rice, China's most important crop, is dominant in the southern provinces and many of the farms here yield two harvests a year. In the north, wheat is of the greatest importance, while in central China wheat and rice vie with each other for the top place. Millet and kaoliang (a variety of grain sorghum) are grown mainly in the northeast and some central provinces, which, together with some northern areas, also provide considerable quantities of barley. Most of the soybean crop is derived from the north and the northeast; corn (maize) is grown in the center and the north, while tea comes mainly from the warm and humid hilly areas of the south. Cotton is grown extensively in the central provinces, but it is also found to a lesser extent in the southeast and in the north. Tobacco comes from the center and parts of the south. Other important crops are potatoes, sugar beets, and oilseeds.\n\n\n\n![](image)Fish ponds near Daye, Hubei\nIn the past decade, the government has been encouraging agricultural mechanization and land consolidation to raise yields and compensate for the loss of rural workers who have migrated to the cities.[219] According to statistics by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the annual growth rate of agricultural mechanization in China is 6.4%. By 2014, the integrated mechanization rate had risen to nearly 60%, with the rate for wheat surpassing 90% and that for maize approaching 80%.[220] In addition to standard agricultural equipment like tractors, China's agriculture cooperatives have begun using high-tech equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles, which are used to spay crops with pesticides.[221] Good progress has been made in increasing water conservancy, and about half the cultivated land is under irrigation.\n\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms were introduced. First of all this began with the shift of farming work to a system of household responsibility and a phasing out of collectivized agriculture. Later this expanded to include a gradual liberalization of price controls; fiscal decentralization; massive privatization of state enterprises, thereby allowing a wide variety of private enterprises in the services and light manufacturing; the foundation of a diversified banking system (but with large amounts of state control); the development of a stock market; and the opening of the economy to increased foreign trade and foreign investment.\n\n\n\n### Housing and construction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Real estate in China\n\nThe real estate industry is about 20% of the Chinese economy.[222] As of 2023, real property accounts for 60% of Chinese household assets.[200]: 161 Also as of 2023, China has the highest rate of home ownership in the world.[200]: 170 90% of urban households own their home.[200]: 170\n\n\nCompared to other nations, investing in stock markets and other assets is harder due to currency controls within the country. As a result, many Chinese citizens own multiple properties, as they are one of the few ways in which it is comparatively easy to grow and preserve wealth. Due to this, many economists have speculated about a property bubble within the Chinese economy[223] On 16 July 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the housing market within the Chinese economy had grown to US$52 trillion, eclipsing the US 2008 housing market before the Financial Crisis.[224]\n\n\nDespite the possibility of a housing bubble, many people still choose to invest their assets in real estate market. On 19 December 2021, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, China's net worth reached $120 trillion in 2020 to overtake the U.S.'s $89 trillion as a red-hot real estate market drove up property value.[225]\n\n\n\n### Energy and mineral resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy policy of China\n\n![](image)Electricity production in China 1980–2019\n**Electricity:**\n* Production: 6.5 trillion kWh (2017)[226]\n* Consumption: 7.7620 trillion kWh (2020)[3]\n* Exports: 21.8 billion kwh (2020)[3]\n* Imports: 6.2 billion kwh (2015)[3]\n\n\n**Electricity – production by source:**\n\n\n\n* Coal: 61.2% (2022)[227]\n* Hydro: 14.9% (2022)\n* Wind: 9.3 (2022)\n* Solar: 4.7% (2022)\n* Nuclear: 4.7% (2022)\n* Natural gas: 3.1% (2022)\n* Other: 2.1% (2022)\n\n\n**Oil:**\n\n\n\n* Production: 3,527,000 bbl/d (560,700 m3/d) (2022)\n* Consumption: 6,534,000 bbl/d (1,038,800 m3/d) (2005) and expected 9,300,000 bbl/d (1,480,000 m3/d) in 2030\n* Exports: 443,300 bbl/d (70,480 m3/d) (2005)\n* Imports: 10,170,000 bbl/d (1,617,000 m3/d) (2022) [228]\n* Net imports: 2,740,000 barrels per day (436,000 m3/d) (2005)\n* Proved reserves: 16.3 Gbbl (2.59×10~~^~~9 m3) (1 January 2006)\n\n\n**Natural gas:**\n\n\n\n* Production: 47.88 km3 (2005 est.)\n* Consumption: 44.93 km3 (2005 est.)\n* Exports: 2.944 km3 (2005)\n* Imports: 0 m3 (2005)\n* Proved reserves: 1,448 km3 (1 January 2006 est.)\n\nChina has natural resources with an estimated worth of $23 trillion, 90% of which are coal and rare earth metals.[229] Since 1980, China's energy production has grown dramatically, as has the proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang.[230] Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. The northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70–75% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5 million barrels (560,000 m3) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields.[231] Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\n\nSince the early 2000s, China's clean energy sector has rapidly developed.[232]: 23 This growth has enabled renewable energy to have an important role in China's international cooperation, including South-South cooperation in which China is a major source of clean energy technology transfer to other developing countries.[232]: 4, 23\n\n\nThe 11th Five-Year Program (2006–10), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of clean coal technology. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n\nAs of 2021, China is facing its worst energy crisis in decades.[233] *The Guardian* reported that \"Companies in the industrial heartlands have been told to limit consumption, residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts, and annual light shows have been cancelled.\"[234]\n\n\n\n#### Mining[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Gold mining in China\n\nOutdated mining and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques [*citation needed*], but China's rapid industrialization requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from Australia and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as steel production rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon.\n\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were coal (nearly two billion tons), iron ore (310 million tons), crude petroleum (175 million tons), natural gas (41 million cubic meters), antimony ore (110,000 tons), tin concentrates (110,000 tons), nickel ore (64,000 tons), tungsten concentrates (67,000 tons), unrefined salt (37 million tons), vanadium (40,000 tons), and molybdenum ore (29,000 tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were bauxite, gypsum, barite, magnesite, talc and related minerals, manganese ore, fluorspar, and zinc. In addition, China produced 2,450 tons of silver and 215 tons of gold in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n\nIn 2019, the country was the world's largest producer of gold;[235] 3rd largest world producer of copper;[236] 3rd worldwide producer of silver;[237] the world's largest producer of sulfur;[238] the world's largest producer of phosphate;[239] the world's largest producer of molybdenum;[240] the world's largest producer of lead;[241] largest world producer of zinc;[242] the world's largest producer of vanadium;[243] largest world producer of tin;[244] the world's largest producer of titanium;[245] the world's largest producer of antimony;[246] 2nd largest worldwide producer of bauxite;[247] 3rd largest world producer of iron ore;[248] 6th largest world producer of manganese;[249] 7th largest world producer of nickel;[250] 10th largest world producer of cobalt;[251] in addition to being the world's largest producer of salt.[252] It was the world's 8th largest producer of uranium in 2018.[253] Furthermore, it is the largest world producer of jade and one of the world producers of topaz, tourmaline, peridot and diamond.\n  \n\nUntil the end of 2019, a total of 173 types of minerals have been discovered in China, including 13 types of energy materials, 59 metals, 95 types of non-metallic minerals and six types of water and gases. In 2019, the newly discovered geological reserves of oil were 1.12 billion tonnes, of which, 160 million tonnes were proven technically recoverable reserves. The newly discovered geological reserves of shale gas were 764.42 billion cubic meters, of which, 183.84 billion cubic meters were proven reserves. With respect to non-oil and gas minerals, the evaluation states that China has great prospecting potential for 24 major minerals, including coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, copper, lead, zinc, bauxite, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, antimony, nickel, gold, silver, lithium, pyrites, phosphate rock, potash, magnesite, fluorite, boron and barite.[254]\n\n\n\n#### Hydroelectric resources[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydroelectricity in China\n\n![](image)Three Gorges Dam\nChina has an abundant potential for hydroelectric power production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the southwest of the country, where coal supplies are poor but demand for energy is rising swiftly. The potential in the northeast is fairly small, but it was there that the first hydroelectric stations were built – by the Japanese during its occupation of Manchuria.[255]\n\n\nThirteen years in construction at a cost of $24 billion, the immense Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River was essentially completed in 2006 and produced more than 100TWh of energy in 2018.\n\n\n\n#### Coal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coal in China\n\n![](image)Coal mining in Inner Mongolia\nChina is well endowed with mineral resources,[256] the most important of which is coal. China's mineral resources include large reserves of coal and iron ore, plus adequate to abundant supplies of nearly all other industrial minerals. Although coal deposits are widely scattered (some coal is found in every province), most of the total is located in the northern part of the country. The province of Shanxi, in fact, is thought to contain about half of the total; other important coal-bearing provinces include Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, and Shandong.[257] Apart from these northern provinces, significant quantities of coal are present in Sichuan, and there are some deposits of importance in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou.[257] A large part of the country's reserves consists of good bituminous coal, but there are also large deposits of lignite. Anthracite is present in several places (especially Liaoning, Guizhou, and Henan), but overall, it is not very significant.[258]\n\n\nTo ensure a more even distribution of coal supplies and to reduce the strain on the less than adequate transportation network, the authorities pressed for the development of a large number of small, locally run mines throughout the country. This campaign was energetically pursued after the 1960s, with the result that thousands of small pits have been established, and they produce more than half the country's coal. This output, however, is typically expensive and is used for local consumption. It has also led to a less than stringent implementation of safety measures in these unregulated mines, which cause several thousands of deaths each year.[259]\n\n\nCoal makes up the bulk of China's energy consumption (70% in 2005, 55% in 2021), and China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. As China's economy continues to grow, China's coal demand is projected to rise significantly. Although coal's share of China's overall energy consumption will decrease, coal consumption will continue to rise in absolute terms. China's continued and increasing reliance on coal as a power source has contributed significantly to putting China on the path to becoming the world's largest emitter of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.\n\n\nAs of 2015, falling coal prices resulted in layoffs at coal mines in the northeast.[260]\n\n\n\n#### Oil and natural gas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Petroleum industry in China\n\n![](image)Chinese oil reserves\nChina's onshore oil resources are mostly located in the Northeast and in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Oil shale is found in a number of places, especially at Fushun in Liaoning, where the deposits overlie the coal reserves, as well as in Guangdong. High quality light oil has been found in the Pearl River estuary of the South China Sea, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, and the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. The country consumes most of its oil output but does export some crude oil and oil products. China has explored and developed oil deposits in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Bohai Sea.\n\n\nIn 2013, the pace of China's economic growth exceeded the domestic oil capacity and floods damaged the nation's oil fields in the middle of the year. Consequently, China imported oil to compensate for the supply reduction and surpassed the US in September 2013 to become the world's largest importer of oil.[261]\n\n\nThe total extent of China's natural gas reserves is unknown, as relatively little exploration for natural gas has been done.[262] Sichuan accounts for almost half of the known natural gas reserves and production.[263] Most of the rest of China's natural gas is associated gas produced in the Northeast's major oil fields, especially Daqing oilfield. Other gas deposits have been found in the Qaidam Basin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang, and offshore to the southwest of Hainan Island.[264] According to an article published in Energy Economics in 2011 by economists Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich) and Abdul Jalil (Wuhan University in China), financial development in China has not taken place at the expense of environmental pollution and financial development has led to a decrease in environmental pollution. Authors conclude that carbon emissions are mainly determined by income, energy consumption and trade openness and their findings confirm the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve in the case of China.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Metals and nonmetals[edit]\n\n\nIron ore reserves are found in most provinces, including Hainan. Gansu, Guizhou, southern Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces have rich deposits. The largest mined reserves are located north of the Yangtze River and supply neighboring iron and steel enterprises. With the exception of nickel, chromium, and cobalt, China is well supplied with ferroalloys and manganese. Reserves of tungsten are also known to be fairly large. Copper resources are moderate, and high-quality ore is present only in a few deposits. Discoveries have been reported from Ningxia. Lead and zinc are available, and bauxite resources are thought to be plentiful. China's antimony reserves are the largest in the world. Tin resources are plentiful, and there are fairly rich deposits of gold. China is the world's fifth largest producer of gold and in the early 21st century became an important producer and exporter of rare metals needed in high-technology industries.\n\n\nChina also produces a fairly wide range of nonmetallic minerals. One of the most important of these is salt, which is derived from coastal evaporation sites in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning, as well as from extensive salt fields in Sichuan, Ningxia, and the Qaidam Basin. There are important deposits of phosphate rock in a number of areas, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hubei. Production has been accelerating every year. As of 2013 China is producing 97,000,000 metric tons of phosphate rock a year.[266] Pyrites occur in several places; Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have the most important deposits. China also has large resources of fluorite (fluorspar), gypsum, asbestos, and has the world's largest reserves and production of cement, clinker and limestone.\n\n\n\n### Industry and manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n\"Made in China\" redirects here. For other uses, see Made in China (disambiguation).\n\nFurther information: Industry of China and Technological and industrial history of China\n\n![](image)China Railway HXD1B Manufactured by CRRC\n![](image)Fuxing high speed train produced by CRRC\nChina has a strong position global position in the production of industrial goods and some of its companies are global leader in the areas of steel, solar energy, and telecommunications accessories.[267]: 131 As of 2022[update], industry accounts for 39.9% of China's GDP.[3] As of 2023, China manufactures approximately one fifth of the world's total output of industrial products.[267]: 133\n\n\n\n![](image)C919 developed by Chinese aerospace manufacturer Comac\nIn November 2012, the State Council of the People's Republic of China mandated a \"social risk assessment\" for all major industrial projects. This requirement followed mass public protests in some locations for planned projects or expansions.[268]\n\n\nMajor industries include mining and ore processing; iron and steel; aluminium; coal; machinery; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemical; fertilizers; food processing; automobiles and other transportation equipment including rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; consumer products including footwear, toys, and electronics; telecommunications and information technology.\n\n\nSince the founding of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation.[269] Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone now account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output.[270] In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered at the hands of a system that has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than ten percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization.[271]\n\n\nThe predominant focus of development in the chemical industry is to expand the output of chemical fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic fibers. The growth of this industry has placed China among the world's leading producers of nitrogenous fertilizers. In the consumer goods sector the main emphasis is on textiles and clothing, which also form an important part of China's exports. Textile manufacturing, a rapidly growing proportion of which consists of synthetics, account for about ten percent of the gross industrial output and continues to be important, but less so than before. The industry tends to be scattered throughout the country, but there are a number of important textile centers, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Harbin.[272][273] There is a growing consumer culture in China.\n\n\n\n#### Steel industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Steel industry in China, List of steel producers, and List of countries by steel production\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers of Guangzhou\nIn 2020, China produced over 1053 million tonnes of steel, over half of the world total. This was an increase of 5.6% over the previous year as global steel production fell by 0.9%. China's share of global crude steel production increased from 53.3% in 2019 to 56.5% in 2020. Decreasing -2.1% in 2021.[274]\n\n\nIron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140 million tons in 2000 increased to 419 million tons in 2006 and 928 million tons by 2018.\n\n\nChina was the top exporter of steel in the world in 2018; export volumes in 2018 were 66.9 million tons, a nine percent decrease over the previous year. It again decreased in 2021 to 66.2 million tons.[275] The decline slowed China's decade-old steel export growth. As of 2012 steel exports faced widespread anti-dumping taxes and had not returned to pre-2008 levels.[276] Domestic demand remained strong, particularly in the developing west where steel production in Xinjiang was expanding.[277]\n\n\nFor the year 2018, China's steel industry reported profits of CNY 470 billion ($70 billion), which was 39% higher than the year before.[278]\n\n\nOf the 45 largest steel producing companies in the world, 21 are Chinese, including the world's largest, China Baowu Steel Group.\n\n\n\n#### Automotive industry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Automotive industry in China\n\nChina is the world's largest automobile producer, manufacturing more than 27 million vehicles in 2018. For comparison, the corresponding numbers for the US and Japan were 11.3 million and 9.7 million respectively. By 2006 China had become the world's third largest automotive vehicle manufacturer (after US and Japan) and the second largest consumer (only after the US). However, four years later, in 2010, China was manufacturing more vehicles than the U.S. and Japan combined. Automobile manufacturing has soared during the reform period. In 1975 only 139,800 automobiles were produced annually, but by 1985 production had reached 443,377, then jumped to nearly 1.1 million by 1992 and increased fairly evenly each year up until 2001, when it reached 2.3 million. In 2002 production rose to nearly 3.25 million and then jumped to 4.44 million in 2003, 5.07 million in 2004, 5.71 million in 2005, 7.28 million in 2006, 8.88 million in 2007, 9.35 million in 2008 and 13.83 million in 2009. China has become the number-one automaker in the world as of 2009. Domestic sales have kept pace with production. After respectable annual increases in the mid- and late 1990s, passenger car sales soared in the early 2000s.\n\n\nIn 2010, China became the world's largest automotive vehicle manufacturer as well as the largest consumer ahead of the United States with an estimated 18 million new cars sold.[279] However, new car sales grew only by an estimated 1% between 2011 and 2012 due to the escalation in the Spratly Islands dispute, which involved Japan, the world's third largest producer of vehicles.[280]\n\n\nChina's automotive industry has been so successful that it began exporting car parts in 1999. China began to plan major moves into the automobile and components export business starting in 2005. A new Honda factory in Guangzhou was built in 2004 solely for the export market and was expected to ship 30,000 passenger vehicles to Europe in 2005. By 2004, twelve major foreign automotive manufacturers had joint-venture plants in China. They produced a wide range of automobiles, minivans, sport utility vehicles, buses, and trucks. In 2003 China exported US$4.7 billion worth of vehicles and components. The vehicle export was 78,000 units in 2004, 173,000 units in 2005, and 340,000 units in 2006. The vehicle and component export is targeted to reach US$70 billion by 2010.[*citation needed*] China's exports of cars increased significantly since 2020, becoming the world's second-largest exporter of cars in 2022 after Japan.[281]\n\n\nThe market for domestically produced cars, under a local name, is likely to continue to grow both inside China and outside. Companies such as Geely, Qiantu and Chery are constantly evaluating new international locations, both in developing and developed countries.[282]\n\n\n\n#### Electric vehicle industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Electric vehicle industry in China and Plug-in electric vehicles in China\n\n![](image)BYD with Dual Mode hybrid engine\nThe electric vehicle industry in China is the largest in the world, accounting for around 57.4% of global production of EVs and around 500,000 exports in 2021.[283] In 2021, CAAM reported China had sold 3.34 million passenger electric vehicles, consisting 2.73 million BEVs (battery-only EVs) and 0.6 million PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles),[284] which is around 53% share of the global market of 6.23 million \"new energy\" passenger vehicles – BEVs, PHEVs, and HEVs.[285] China also dominates the plug-in electric bus and light commercial vehicle market, reaching over 500,000 buses (98% of global stock) and 247,500 electric commercial vehicles (65% of global stock) in 2019,[286] and recording new sales of 186,000 commercial EVs in 2021.[284]\n\n\nPlug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales was 15% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2021.[287] NEV adoption rapidly increased to a record 28% in March 2022, and according to BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu could reach 35% by end of 2022, exceeding the government goal of 20% by 2025.[288] The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots.[289]\n\n\nThe battery industry is closely related to the EV industry as batteries constitute around 1/3 of the cost of EVs[290] and around 80% of lithium-ion batteries in the world are used in EVs.[291] The industry also has significant Chinese presence, with major players including world's largest CATL, BYD, CALB, Gotion, SVOLT and WeLion.[292]\n\n\n\n#### Semiconductor industry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Semiconductor industry in China\n\nThe Chinese semiconductor industry, including IC design and manufacturing, forms a major part of China's IT industry. China's semiconductor industry consists of a wide variety of companies, from integrated device manufacturers to pure-play foundries to fabless semiconductor companies. Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) design and manufacture integrated circuits. Pure-play foundries only manufacture devices for other companies, without designing them, while fabless semiconductor companies only design devices. Examples of Chinese IDMs are YMTC and CXMT, examples of Chinese pure-play foundries are SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor and Wingtech, and examples of Chinese fabless companies are Zhaoxin, HiSilicon and UNISOC.\n\n\nChina is the currently the world's largest semiconductor market in terms of consumption. In 2020, China represented 53.7% of worldwide chip sales, or $239.45 billion out of $446.1 billion. However, a large percentage are imported from multinational suppliers. In 2020, imports took up 83.38% ($199.7 billion) of total chip sales. In response, the country has launched a number of initiatives to close the gap, including investing $150 billion into its domestic IC industry, with a \"Made in China 2025\" goal of 70% domestic production.[293][294][295]\n\n\nChina leads the world in terms of number of new fabs under construction, with 8 out of 19 worldwide in 2021, and 17 fabs in total are expected to start construction from 2021 to 2023. Total installed capacity of Chinese-owned chipmakers will also increase from 2.96 million wafers per month (wpm) in 2020 to 3.572 million wpm in 2021.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other industries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Electronics industry in China, Pharmaceutical industry in China, and Shipping industry of China\n\nSubstantial investments were made in the manufacture of solar panels and wind generators by a number of companies, supported by liberal loans by banks and local governments. However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to anti-dumping penalties by both the United States and Europe. The global oversupply has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 but, even at the sharply reduced price resulting from oversupply, as of 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Huawei MateBook series at a World Mobile Congress\nChina is the world's biggest sex toy producer and accounts for 70% of the worldwide sex toys production.[297] In the country, 1,000 manufacturers are active in this industry, which generates about two billion dollars a year.[297]\n\n\nAs of 2011, China was the world's largest market for personal computers[298] Since 2019, Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motors, Kia Motors and LG Electronics are moving some or all production out of China, in order to reduce overdependence on the Chinese market and avoid risks related with increased local competition, China's economic slowdown and the US-China trade war.[299]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated shops, rationing, and regulated prices – with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The wholesale and retail trade has expanded quickly, with numerous shopping malls, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas. Public administration remains a main component of the service sector, while tourism has become a significant factor in employment and a source of foreign exchange.[300]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Telecommunications in China and Telecommunications industry in China\n\nThe affordability of mobile phones and internet data in China has resulted in the number of mobile internet users in China surpassing the number of computer internet users.[301]: 178\n\n\nChina's number of Internet users or netizens topped 137 million by the end of 2006,[302] an increase of 23.4% from a year before and 162 million by June 2007, making China the second-largest Internet user after the United States, according to China's Ministry of Information Industry (MII). China's mobile phone penetration rate was 34% in 2007. In 2006, mobile phone users sent 429 billion text messages (on average 967 text messages per user). For 2006, the number of fixed-lines grew by 79%, mainly in the rural areas.[303] By 2021, the number of Internet users in China increased to over 1.05 billion.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer internet[edit]\n\n\nChina's economy is one of the world's leaders in consumer internet and mobile payments.[267]: 130 Mobile payment methods via apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay were quickly adopted in China in part due to the relative lack of credit cards in the country.[267]: 130 This technological leapfrogging also led to a boom in online shopping and retail banking.[267]: 130\n\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in China and List of World Heritage Sites in China\n\nChina hosts the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (55). China's tourism industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the national economy and is also one of the industries with a very distinct global competitive edge. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, travel and tourism directly contributed CNY 1,362 billion (US$216 billion) to the Chinese economy (about 2.6% of GDP).[305] In 2011, total international tourist arrivals was 58 million, and international tourism receipts were US$48 billion.[306]\n\n\nChinese business travel spending is also forecast to be the highest in the world by 2014, overtaking the United States. According to a Global Business Travel Association study, total business-travel spending is expected to reach US$195 billion in 2012.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Luxury goods[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Luxury goods of China\n\nHong Kong and Macau benefit from favorable taxation rules and are favored locations for tourists from elsewhere in China to purchase luxury goods like cosmetics, jewelry, and designer fashion goods.[308]: 116\n\n\nPorcelain has long been one of China's most important luxury exports.[308]: 226 It was especially important to early trade between China and the West, with much of that trade being conducted through Macau.[308]: 226\n\n\nAfter a 2012 ban on government agencies purchasing luxury goods, often used as \"gifts\", sales of luxury goods in China remained strong but slowed, even falling slightly for luxury retailers in the 4th quarter of 2012,[309] with sales of shark fins and edible swallow nests, once staples of lavish government banquets, down sharply.[310]\n\n\nMany shops in international travel destinations have specialized staff devoted to Chinese customers.[309]\n\n\n\n## Labor and welfare[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Labor relations in China and Social welfare in China\n\n![](image)A window washer on a skyscraper in Shanghai\n![](image)A worker makes ceramics in Yunnan\n![](image)A Chinese coal miner at the Jin Hua Gong MineIn 1979–1980, the state reformed factories by giving wage increases to workers, which was immediately offset by sharply rising inflation rates of 6–7%. The reforms also dismantled the iron rice bowl, which meant it witnessed a rise in unemployment in the economy. In 1979–80 there were twenty million unemployed people.[311]\n\n\n![](image)This chart shows the Chinese employment by sectors during time[312]\nChina's estimated employed labor force in 2005 totaled 791 million persons, about 60% of the total population. During 2003, 49% of the labor force worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; 22% in mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction industries; and 29% in the services sector and other categories. In 2004 some 25 million persons were employed by 743,000 private enterprises. Urban wages rose rapidly from 2004 to 2007, at a rate of 13 to 19% per year with average wages near $200/month in 2007.[313] By 2016 the average monthly wage for workers engaged in manufacturing goods for export was $424. This wage, combined with other costs of doing business in China, had, more or less, equalized any Chinese cost advantage with respect to developed economies.[314]\n\n\nThe All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the country's only legally permissible trade union. Attempts to form trade unions independent of the ACFTU have been rare and short-lived. One notable example is the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation formed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Martial Law Command Headquarters issued a public notice declaring the BWAF an illegal organization and ordering it to disband on the grounds that Federation leaders were among \"the main instigators and organizers in the capital of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.[315][316]\n\n\nIn 2010, the issues of manufacturing wages caused a wildcat strike at a Honda parts plant. This resulted in wage increases both at the struck plant and other industrial plants.[317][318][319][320][321]\n\n\nThe 2010 census found that China was now half urban and rapidly aging due to the one child policy. This is expected to lead to increased demand for labor to take care of an elderly population and a reduced supply of migrant labor from the countryside.[322]\n\n\nDue to worsening pollution, the corruption and political uncertainties of the one-party state and the limited economic freedom in an economy dominated by large state-owned enterprises, many skilled professionals are either leaving the country or preparing safety nets for themselves abroad.[323][324][325] In the decade up to 2014, ten million Chinese emigrated to other countries, taking assets and their technical skills.[326]\n\n\nA law approved February 2013 will mandate a nationwide minimum wage at 40% average urban salaries to be phased in fully by 2015.[327]\n\n\n\n## State-owned enterprises[edit]\n\n\nMain article: State-owned enterprises of China\n\nChina's SOEs perform important functions that benefit the state.[328] Academic Wendy Leutert writes, \"They contribute to central and local governments revenues through dividends and taxes, support urban employment, keep key input prices low, channel capital towards targeted industries and technologies, support sub-national redistribution to poorer interior and western provinces, and aid the state's response to natural disasters, financial crises and social instability.\"[328]\n\n\nAs of 2017, China has more SOEs than any other country, and the most SOEs among large national companies.[328] State-owned enterprises accounted for over 60% of China's market capitalization in 2019[329] and generated 40% of China's GDP of US$15.98 trillion dollars (101.36 trillion yuan) in 2020, with domestic and foreign private businesses and investment accounting for the remaining 60%.[330][331] As of the end of 2019, the total assets of all China's SOEs, including those operating in the financial sector, reached US$58.97 trillion In 2015.[332] Ninety-one (91) of these SOEs belong to the 2020 Fortune Global 500 companies.[333]\n\n\n\n## External trade[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of trade of the People's Republic of China\nFurther information: List of the largest trading partners of China, List of exports of China, List of Chinese administrative divisions by exports, and China–United States trade war\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In 2010, China became the world's largest exporter, and has continued to be the world's largest exporter as of at least 2023.[334]: 88 It has free trade agreements with several nations, including ASEAN, Australia, Cambodia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea and Switzerland.[335][336] By 2020, China became the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries.[200]: 228 As of 2022[update], China's largest trading partners are ASEAN, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Russia, Brazil, India, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the Third World was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. However, after Mao Zedong's death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, Hong Kong and Taiwan both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, which promotes free trade and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\n\n\nChina became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001.[337] The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, U.S. exporters continue to have concerns about fair market access due to China's restrictive trade policies and U.S. export restrictions. In October 2019, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng promised to further decrease tariffs and remove non-tariff barriers for global investors, he also welcomed multinational companies to invest more in China.[338]\n\n![](image)With bilateral trade exceeding US$38.6 billion, China is India's largest trading partner[339] and shown here is a Chinese container ship unloading its cargo at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Navi Mumbai, India\nChina's global trade exceeded $4.16 trillion at the end of 2013, having broken the hundred-billion mark in 1988 and half a trillion by 2001. China global trade exceeded US$6 Trillion in 2021[340]\nThe table below shows the average annual growth (in nominal US dollar terms) of China's foreign trade during the reform era:[341]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Two-way trade | Exports | Imports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981–1985 | +12.8% | +8.6% | +16.1%\n |\n| 1986–1990 | +10.6% | +17.8% | +4.8%\n |\n| 1991–1995 | +19.5% | +19.1% | +19.9%\n |\n| 1996–2000 | +11.0% | +10.9% | +11.3%\n |\n| 2001–2005 | +24.6% | +25.0% | +24.0%\n |\n| 2006–2010 | +15.9% | +15.7% | +16.1%\n |\n| 2016–2021 | +11.0% |  |\n\nThe vast majority of China's imports consists of industrial supplies and capital goods, notably machinery and high-technology equipment, the majority of which comes from the developed countries, primarily Japan[*citation needed*] and the United States[*citation needed*]. Regionally, almost half of China's imports come from East and Southeast Asia, and about a fourth of China's exports go to the same destinations[*citation needed*]. About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest ports in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233 billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%. China's share of total U.S. imports has grown from 7% to 15% since 1996.\n\n\nTrade volume between China and Russia reached $29.1 billion in 2005, an increase of 37.1% compared with 2004. A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, Van Jingsun, said that the volume of trade between China and Russia could exceed forty billion dollars in 2007.[342] China's export of machinery and electronic goods to Russia grew 70%, which is 24% of China's total export to Russia in the first eleven months of 2005. During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13 billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05 billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368 million during January–September 2005, twice that in 2004. By 2022, trade between China and Russia reached a record $190 billion,[19] with China becoming Russia's trading partner.[343]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in Nizhny Novgorod, the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its 11th Five-Year Program, adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n\nChina is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free-trade area which was signed into agreement in November 2020. The RCEP, which includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN nations, represents about a third of the world's population and 29% of global gross domestic product. The RCEP aims to eliminate tariffs on a variety of products within 20 years.[344] On 17 September 2021, China formally applied to join another large Asia-Pacific free-trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).[345]\n\n\n\n## Foreign investment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China, Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor, Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, China Investment Promotion Agency, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Ministry of Commerce (China)\n\nIn 2022, China was amongst the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $180 billion, though most of these were speculated to be from Hong Kong.[346] As of the end of June 2020, FDI stock in China reached US$2.947 trillion, and China's outgoing FDI stock stood at US$2.128 trillion. The total foreign financial assets owned by China reached US$7.860 trillion, and its foreign financial liabilities US$5.716 trillion, making China the second largest creditor nation after Japan in the world.[347]\n\n\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms. The Encouraged Industry Catalogue sets out the degree of foreign involvement allowed in various industry sectors. From the beginning of the reforms legalizing foreign investment, capital inflows expanded every year until 1999.[348] Foreign-invested enterprises account for 58–60% of China's imports and exports.[349]\n\n\nSince the early 1990s, the government has allowed foreign investors to manufacture and sell a wide range of goods on the domestic market, eliminated time restrictions on the establishment of joint ventures, provided some assurances against nationalization, allowed foreign partners to become chairs of joint venture boards, and authorized the establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises, now the preferred form of FDI. In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state.\n\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in Shanghai and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of stock in selected companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45 billion in foreign direct investment. China revised significantly its laws on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and China Foreign Equity Joint Ventures in 2000 and 2001. The Vice Minister of Finance Zhu Guangyao announced, foreign investors will be allowed to own up to 51% on domestic financial service companies. Formerly foreign ownership was limited to a 49% stake in these firms.[350]\n\n\nForeign investment remains a strong element in China's rapid expansion in world trade and has been an important factor in the growth of urban jobs. China's economic leadership on global capital flows emphasizes long-term infrastructure and development finance over short-term flows which, under the current order, have imposed large costs on many economies.[351] In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totaled about $145 billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) after the United States, receiving $39 billion in 1999 and $41 billion in 2000. China is now one of the leading FDI recipients in the world, receiving almost $80 billion in 2005 according to World Bank statistics. In 2006, China received $69.47 billion.[352] By 2011, with the U.S. seeing a decline in foreign investment following the 2008 financial crisis, China overtook it as the top destination for FDI, receiving over $280 billion that year.[353]\n\n\nAmid slowing economic conditions and a weakening yuan in 2015, December of that year saw a 5.8% drop in FDI to China.[354] While China's rank as the top receiver of FDI continued through 2014, the slowing of inbound investment in 2015 combined with a massive rebound in foreign investment to the United States resulted in the U.S. reclaiming its position as the top investment destination.[355] Data from the American Chamber of Commerce in China's *2016 China Business Climate Survey* confirms this trend, although it also demonstrates that China remains a top investment destination. This survey of over 500 members found that \"China remains a top three investment priority for six out of ten member companies,\" though this is a decline from the 2012 high of eight out of ten respondents considering China a top priority.[356]\n\n\nForeign exchange reserves totaled $155 billion in 1999 and $165 billion in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves exceeded $800 billion in 2005, more than doubling from 2003. Foreign exchange reserves were $819 billion at the end of 2005, $1.066 trillion at the end of 2006, $1.9 trillion by June 2008. In addition, by the end of September 2008 China replaced Japan for the first time as the largest foreign holder of US treasury securities with a total of $585 billion, vs Japan $573 billion. China's foreign exchange reserves are the largest in the world.[357]\n\n\nAs part of its WTO accession, China undertook to eliminate certain trade-related investment measures and to open up specified sectors that had previously been closed to foreign investment. New laws, regulations, and administrative measures to implement these commitments are being issued. Major remaining barriers to foreign investment include opaque and inconsistently enforced laws and regulations and the lack of a rules-based legal infrastructure. Warner Bros., for instance, withdrew its cinema business in China as a result of a regulation that requires Chinese investors to own at least a 51 percent stake or play a leading role in a foreign joint venture.[358]\n\n\nAnother major development in the history of foreign investment in China was the establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in September 2013.[359] The Zone is considered a testing ground for a number of economic and social reforms.[360][361] Critically, foreign investment is controlled via a \"negative list\" approach, where FDI is permitted in all sectors unless explicitly prohibited by the inclusion of a given sector on the negative list published by the Shanghai Municipal Government.[362]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2019, China's National People's Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law,[363] which comes into effect on 1 January 2020. Foreign investment in China comes with a number of ethical risks which pose major challenges which investors must navigate.[364]\n\n\nA 2021 McKinsey report estimated that the Chinese economy as currently the largest consumer economy measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, and that it is expected to add more consumption than any other country within the next decade. Due to this and the rapid continued growth of China's middle class, large multinational companies like Walmart, have been keen to invest in China to tap into the growing domestic consumer market.[365][366]\n\n\n\n### Chinese investment abroad[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A TCL television set\n![](image)A Meizu smartphone\n![](image)Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nSee also: Go Out policy\n\nOutward foreign direct investment is a new feature of Chinese globalization, where local Chinese firms seek to make investments in both developing and developed countries.[367] It was reported in 2011 that there was increasing investment by capital rich Chinese firms in promising firms in the United States. Such investments offer access to expertise in marketing and distribution potentially useful in exploiting the developing Chinese domestic market.[368]\n\n\nSince 2005, Chinese companies have been actively expanding outside of China, in both developed and developing countries. In 2013, Chinese companies invested US$90 billion globally in non-financial sectors, 16% more than 2012.[369]\n\n\nBetween January 2009 and December 2013, China contributed a total of $161.03bn in outward FDI, creating almost 300,000 jobs. Western Europe was the largest regional recipient of Chinese outward FDI, with Germany receiving the highest number of FDI projects for any country globally.[370]\n\n\nThere are two ways Chinese companies choose to enter a foreign market: organic growth and Merge & Acquisition (M&A). Many Chinese companies would prefer M&A for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Fast. M&A is the fastest way for a company to expand into another country by acquiring brand, distribution, talents, and technology. Chinese CEOs has been used to growing at 50%+ speed and do not want to spend capital.\n* China market. China has become the world's largest economy. Many Chinese acquire foreign companies and then bring their products/services to China, anything from premium cars to fashion clothing to meat to Hollywood movies.\n* Cheap capital access. The huge Chinese domestic market help many Chinese companies accumulated financial capital to do M&A. Chinese government also provides long-term, low-interest capital for companies to expand abroad.\n* Low risk. M&A helped Chinese companies avoid risk of failure of organic growth as they got an established company with everything in place.\n* Cheap labor. Some companies may move part of the manufacturing in high labor cost countries to China to reduce the cost and make the product more attractive in price.\n* Trade and policy barrier. Chinese companies in many sectors face quota limitation and high tax, which prevent them from being competitive in foreign markets.\n* Depressed assets. 2008–2010 global economic crisis created liquidity problems for a lot of western companies and reduced their market value. Chinese companies believe it is a great opportunity for them to buy these depressed assets at discount. China's direct foreign investment in non-financial sector growth from US$25 billion in 2007 to US$90 billion in 2013, more than three times.[371]\n* China is growing in investments and influencing power over Europe, and the EU has begun to take notice.[372]\n\n\nAt the beginning, state-owned enterprises dominate the foreign acquisition and most of the money goes to oil and minerals. Since 2005, more and more private companies start to acquire non-raw material foreign companies.

According to market consecutive research by the Monogram Group, a Chicago-based advertising agency, in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012, American consumers' willingness to purchase Chinese products across all categories except PC remained the same or became worse during 2007–2012. The only sector in which Americans were more likely to purchase was personal computers.[374]\n\n\n\n![](image)China's leader Xi Jinping and Poland's President Andrzej Duda during the inauguration of the China Railway Express in Warsaw, Poland, 20 June 2016\nMoreover, many M&A deals have failed because companies underestimated the challenges and failed to restructure the company.\n\n\nCase 1: Shanghai Auto acquired 48.9% of Korean Ssangyong at US$500 million in 2004, making it the most ambitious acquisition in Chinese auto industry at the time. Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.[375][376]\n\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint venture called TCL–Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n\n\n\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book *Resumption of Trading* by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n\n\n### Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$969 billion.[377]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of China\n\nFurther information: Migration in China, Urbanization in China, Chinese emigration, Standard of living in China, and Poverty in China\n\nSince the 1950s medical care, public hygiene and sanitation improved considerably, and epidemics were controlled. Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The population growth rate surged as the mortality rate dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate, and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958–60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population control drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per family policy was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around a billion, and by the early 2000s surpassed 1.3 billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.[378] China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world.\n\n\nAccording to a Forbes China Rich List (2007), China had 66 billionaires, the second largest number after the United States, which had 415. In the 2006 Forbes Rich List it stated that there were 15 Chinese billionaires.[379] In the 2007 Hurun Report, it lists 106 billionaires in China.[380] According to the latest Forbes report (2021), China has a total of 626 billionaires, after gaining 239 new billionaires since March 2020.[381]\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 Brookings report, China become the largest middle-class consumption market in the world and is deemed a \"priority market\" for major multinational firm. It also estimates that 1.2 billion Chinese will be part of the middle class by 2027, and makeup a quarter of the world's middle class.[382]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to statistics released by China's National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the size of the labor force, people aged 15 to 59, in China shrank slightly to 937.27 million people, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the CCP, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.[383]\n\n\n\n## Transportation and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in China\n\n![](image)Shanghai Maglev Train\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.[384]\n\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet military transport and logistics needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of ocean shipping was broadened considerably.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFreight haulage is mainly provided by rail transport. The rail sector is monopolized by China Railway and there is wide variation in services provided. In late 2007 China became one of the few countries in the world to launch its own indigenously developed high-speed train.[385] As rail capacity is struggling to meet demand for the transport of goods and raw materials such as coal, air routes, roads and waterways are rapidly being developed to provide an increasing proportion of China's overall transportation needs.[386]\n\n\nSome economic experts have argued that the development gap between China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.[387]\n\n\n\n## Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in China\n\n![](image)Tencent, one of the world's most valuable technology conglomerates\nScience and technology in China has in recent decades developed rapidly. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform, and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socio-economic development of the country as well as for national prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, artificial intelligence,[388] academic publishing, patents and commercial applications. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses. Its Thousand Talents Plan aims to attract innovative Chinese academics living abroad (as well as some foreigners) back to China in support of its economic innovation goals.[389]\n\n\n\n## Anti-monopoly and competition[edit]\n\n\nThe Chinese technology sector has been characterized as being dominated by few, larger entities including Ant Group and Tencent.[390] There have been attempts by the Xi Jinping Administration to enforce economic competition rules, and probes into Alibaba and Tencent have been launched by Chinese economic regulators.[391]\n\n\nThe crackdown on monopolies by tech giants and internet companies were followed with calls by the Politburo against monopolistic practices by commercial retail giants like Alibaba.[392] Comparisons have been made with similar probes into Amazon in the United States.[393]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Business portal\n\n\n* Bamboo network\n* Beijing Consensus\n* Central Financial Work Commission\n* China Securities Regulatory Commission\n* China Beijing Equity Exchange\n* China Circle\n* China Economic Databases\n* China Milan Equity Exchange\n* Dual circulation\n* Economy of the Han dynasty\n* Economy of the Ming dynasty\n* Economy of the Song dynasty\n* Grasping the large, letting go of the small\n* Group buying\n* Guo jin min tui\n* Hukou\n* Imperial Bank of China\n* Leading stocks\n* List of companies of China\n* List of largest Chinese companies\n* Oil shale in China\n* Panda bonds\n* Rural credit cooperative\n* Silk Road\n* Township and Village Enterprises\n* Three Rural Issues\n* Yangtze Delta\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In 2011, China set a new poverty line at RMB 2300 (approximately US$400).[6]\n2. **^** Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution.\n3. **^** Modeled ILO estimate.\n4. **^** GDP figures exclude Taiwan, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau\n5. **^** China had a hundred million wealthy people (each owning a net wealth of over US$110,000) and the US 99 million.

It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\nLocated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Tibetans, Mongols, Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining and nearby Haidong), Hui, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.[11]\n\n\nIn the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).[12] Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen's and Ralpacan's reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,[13] which included Xi'an.\n\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire,[*clarification needed*] small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of Central Plain polities. The Song dynasty defeated the Kokonor Kingdom in the 1070s.[14] During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[15]\n\n\nMost of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty’s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[16] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[17] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[18]\n\n\nFrom 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.[19] Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the \"Tibetan frontier district\".[20][21] In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.\n\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[22] The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai.[23]: 405 Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.\n\n\nIn July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was \"Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur\" (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai).[24] In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin (warlord) and then Ma Qi's son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords.[25] Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui.[26] Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.\n\n\nMa Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated.[27] General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[28]\n\n\nAs the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[29] Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis' Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south.[23]: 408 Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai's population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.[23]: 411\n\n\n\n* ![The Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau](image)\n\nThe Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau\n* ![Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942](image)\n\nChiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nQinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).\n\n\nThe Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[30]\n\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.\n\n\nQinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province. \n\n\nThe Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. \n\n\n\n* ![Nyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai](image)\n\nNyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai\n* ![Riyue Mountain in Qinghai](image)\n\nRiyue Mountain in Qinghai\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.

Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qinghai\n\nThe Politics of Qinghai Province in the People's Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\n\n\nThe Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the \"Qinghai Party Chief\".\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Qinghai and List of township-level divisions of Qinghai.\n\nBecause the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority[30] and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[27] Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Qinghai** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Xining**\n\n**Haidong**\n\n**HaibeiTibetan AP**\n\n**HuangnanTibetan AP**\n\n**HainanTibetan AP**\n\n**Guoluo (Golog)Tibetan AP**\n\n**YushuTibetan AP**\n\n**HaixiMongol and Tibetan AP**\n\n**(Haixi)**\n |\n| Division code[33] | Division\n | Area in km2[34] | Population 2010[35] | Seat\n | Divisions[36] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 630000 | Qinghai Province\n | 720,000.00 | 5,626,723 | Xining city | 7 | 25 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 630100 | Xining city\n | 7,424.11 | 2,208,708 | Chengzhong District | 5 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| 630200 | Haidong city\n | 13,043.99 | 1,396,845 | Ledu District | 2 |  | 4 |  |\n| 632200 | Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 33,349.99 | 273,304 | Haiyan County |  | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 632300 | Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 17,908.89 | 256,716 | Tongren city |  | 2 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 632500 | Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 43,377.11 | 441,691 | Gonghe County |  | 5 |  |  |\n| 632600 | Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 76,442.38 | 181,682 | Maqên County |  | 6 |  |  |\n| 632700 | Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 197,953.70 | 378,439 | Yushu city |  | 5 |  | 1\n |\n| 632800 | Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 300,854.48 | 489,338 | Delingha city |  | 3 |  | 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Qinghai Province** | 青海省 | **Qīnghǎi Shěng** |\n| Xining city | 西宁市 | Xīníng Shì\n |\n| Haidong city | 海东市 | Hǎidōng Shì\n |\n| Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海北藏族自治州 | Hǎiběi Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 黄南藏族自治州 | Huángnán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海南藏族自治州 | Hǎinán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 果洛藏族自治州 | Guǒluò Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 玉树藏族自治州 | Yùshù Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海西蒙古族藏族自治州 | Hǎixī Měnggǔzú Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n\nThe eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[37] | District area[37] | City proper[37] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Xining** | 1,153,417 | 1,198,304 | 2,208,708 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Golmud | 156,779 | 186,341 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Haidong[a] | 120,433 | 363,159 | 1,396,845 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Yushu[b] | 56,802 | 120,447 | *part of Yushu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Delingha | 54,844 | 78,184 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Mangnai[c] | 33,440 | 33,451 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Haidong Prefecture is currently known as Haidong PLC after census; Ledu County & Ping'an County is currently known as Ledu & Ping'an (core districts of Haidong) after census.\n2. **^** Yushu County is currently known as Yushu CLC after census.\n3. **^** Mangnai Administrative Zone & Lenghu Administrative Zone County is currently known as Mangnai CLC after census.\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912[38] | 368,000 | —     |\n| 1928[39] | 619,000 | +68.2% |\n| 1936–37[40] | 1,196,000 | +93.2% |\n| 1947[41] | 1,308,000 | +9.4% |\n| 1954[42] | 1,676,534 | +28.2% |\n| 1964[43] | 2,145,604 | +28.0% |\n| 1982[44] | 3,895,706 | +81.6% |\n| 1990[45] | 4,456,946 | +14.4% |\n| 2000[46] | 4,822,963 | +8.2% |\n| 2010[47] | 5,626,722 | +16.7% |\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nThere are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population.[48] In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.[27] Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an.[16] The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.[49]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Qinghai (2000s)\n\n\n\nBuddhism, Chinese folk religions (including Taoism), Bön and non-religious population (81.73%)\nIslam[50] (17.51%)\nChristianity[51] (0.76%)\n\n![](image)The Dongguan Mosque in Qinghai\nThe predominant religions in Qinghai are Chinese folk religions (including Taoist traditions and Confucianism) and Chinese Buddhism among the Han Chinese. The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province's population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004.[51] According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.[50]\n\n\nFrom September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.[52]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![A Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nA Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining\n* ![A Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining](image)\n\nA Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining\n* ![Mosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County](image)\n\nMosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County\n* ![Rongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County](image)\n\nRongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County\n* ![Great Mosque of Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nGreat Mosque of Duoba, Xining\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nQinghai has been influenced by interactions \"between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west\".[27] The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[53] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the *Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven*.[*citation needed*] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[54]\n\n\nThe main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380.[23]: 402 Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities.[27] The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat.[30] The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[55]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oil well in Tsaidam (Qaidam), Qinghai\nQinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (USD 50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (USD 9,028) in nominal), the 24th in China.[3]\n\n\nIts heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy.[56] Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.\n\n\nOutside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.[56]\n\n\n\n### Economic and technological development zone[edit]\n\n\nXining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. In the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River—one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m and the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\n\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi'ning Airport — a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.\n\n\nIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.[57]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qinghai Lake.\nMany tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.\n\n\nDuring the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.\n\n\nQinghai Lake (青海湖; *qīnghǎi hú*) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the \"Roof of the World\", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (鸟岛; *niǎo dǎo*). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)China National Highway 109 in Qinghai\nThe Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.\n\n\nConstruction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.\n\n\nSix National Highways run through the province.\n\n\nXining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province’s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.[58]\n\n\n\n## Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications industry in China\n\nSince the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its \"Access to Telephones Project\", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.\n\n\nSatellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[*citation needed*] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.\n\n\n\n## Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Qinghai.\n\n* Qinghai University (青海大学)\n* Qinghai Normal University (青海师范大学)\n* Qinghai University for Nationalities (青海民族大学)\n* Qinghai Medical College (青海医学院)\n* Qinghai Radio & Television University (青海广播电视大学)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2010 Yushu earthquake\n* Amdo\n* Geladandong\n* Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)\n* Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)\n* *Iris qinghainica* (native plant of Qinghai)\n* Major national historical and cultural sites in Qinghai\n* Tectonic summary of Qinghai\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Qinghai Province\".

It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\nLocated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Tibetans, Mongols, Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining and nearby Haidong), Hui, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.[11]\n\n\nIn the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).[12] Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen's and Ralpacan's reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,[13] which included Xi'an.\n\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire,[*clarification needed*] small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of Central Plain polities. The Song dynasty defeated the Kokonor Kingdom in the 1070s.[14] During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[15]\n\n\nMost of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty’s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[16] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[17] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[18]\n\n\nFrom 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.[19] Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the \"Tibetan frontier district\".[20][21] In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.\n\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[22] The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai.[23]: 405 Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.\n\n\nIn July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was \"Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur\" (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai).[24] In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin (warlord) and then Ma Qi's son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords.[25] Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui.[26] Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.\n\n\nMa Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated.[27] General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[28]\n\n\nAs the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[29] Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis' Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south.[23]: 408 Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai's population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.[23]: 411\n\n\n\n* ![The Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau](image)\n\nThe Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau\n* ![Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942](image)\n\nChiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nQinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).\n\n\nThe Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[30]\n\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.\n\n\nQinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province. \n\n\nThe Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. \n\n\n\n* ![Nyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai](image)\n\nNyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai\n* ![Riyue Mountain in Qinghai](image)\n\nRiyue Mountain in Qinghai\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.

Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qinghai\n\nThe Politics of Qinghai Province in the People's Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\n\n\nThe Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the \"Qinghai Party Chief\".\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Qinghai and List of township-level divisions of Qinghai.\n\nBecause the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority[30] and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[27] Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Qinghai** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Xining**\n\n**Haidong**\n\n**HaibeiTibetan AP**\n\n**HuangnanTibetan AP**\n\n**HainanTibetan AP**\n\n**Guoluo (Golog)Tibetan AP**\n\n**YushuTibetan AP**\n\n**HaixiMongol and Tibetan AP**\n\n**(Haixi)**\n |\n| Division code[33] | Division\n | Area in km2[34] | Population 2010[35] | Seat\n | Divisions[36] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 630000 | Qinghai Province\n | 720,000.00 | 5,626,723 | Xining city | 7 | 25 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 630100 | Xining city\n | 7,424.11 | 2,208,708 | Chengzhong District | 5 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| 630200 | Haidong city\n | 13,043.99 | 1,396,845 | Ledu District | 2 |  | 4 |  |\n| 632200 | Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 33,349.99 | 273,304 | Haiyan County |  | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 632300 | Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 17,908.89 | 256,716 | Tongren city |  | 2 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 632500 | Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 43,377.11 | 441,691 | Gonghe County |  | 5 |  |  |\n| 632600 | Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 76,442.38 | 181,682 | Maqên County |  | 6 |  |  |\n| 632700 | Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 197,953.70 | 378,439 | Yushu city |  | 5 |  | 1\n |\n| 632800 | Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 300,854.48 | 489,338 | Delingha city |  | 3 |  | 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Qinghai Province** | 青海省 | **Qīnghǎi Shěng** |\n| Xining city | 西宁市 | Xīníng Shì\n |\n| Haidong city | 海东市 | Hǎidōng Shì\n |\n| Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海北藏族自治州 | Hǎiběi Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 黄南藏族自治州 | Huángnán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海南藏族自治州 | Hǎinán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 果洛藏族自治州 | Guǒluò Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 玉树藏族自治州 | Yùshù Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海西蒙古族藏族自治州 | Hǎixī Měnggǔzú Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n\nThe eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[37] | District area[37] | City proper[37] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Xining** | 1,153,417 | 1,198,304 | 2,208,708 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Golmud | 156,779 | 186,341 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Haidong[a] | 120,433 | 363,159 | 1,396,845 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Yushu[b] | 56,802 | 120,447 | *part of Yushu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Delingha | 54,844 | 78,184 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Mangnai[c] | 33,440 | 33,451 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Haidong Prefecture is currently known as Haidong PLC after census; Ledu County & Ping'an County is currently known as Ledu & Ping'an (core districts of Haidong) after census.\n2. **^** Yushu County is currently known as Yushu CLC after census.\n3. **^** Mangnai Administrative Zone & Lenghu Administrative Zone County is currently known as Mangnai CLC after census.\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912[38] | 368,000 | —     |\n| 1928[39] | 619,000 | +68.2% |\n| 1936–37[40] | 1,196,000 | +93.2% |\n| 1947[41] | 1,308,000 | +9.4% |\n| 1954[42] | 1,676,534 | +28.2% |\n| 1964[43] | 2,145,604 | +28.0% |\n| 1982[44] | 3,895,706 | +81.6% |\n| 1990[45] | 4,456,946 | +14.4% |\n| 2000[46] | 4,822,963 | +8.2% |\n| 2010[47] | 5,626,722 | +16.7% |\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nThere are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population.[48] In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province.

The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province's population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004.[51] According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.[50]\n\n\nFrom September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.[52]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![A Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nA Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining\n* ![A Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining](image)\n\nA Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining\n* ![Mosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County](image)\n\nMosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County\n* ![Rongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County](image)\n\nRongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County\n* ![Great Mosque of Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nGreat Mosque of Duoba, Xining\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nQinghai has been influenced by interactions \"between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west\".[27] The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[53] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the *Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven*.[*citation needed*] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[54]\n\n\nThe main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380.[23]: 402 Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities.[27] The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat.[30] The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[55]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oil well in Tsaidam (Qaidam), Qinghai\nQinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (USD 50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (USD 9,028) in nominal), the 24th in China.[3]\n\n\nIts heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy.[56] Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.\n\n\nOutside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.[56]\n\n\n\n### Economic and technological development zone[edit]\n\n\nXining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. In the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River—one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m and the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\n\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi'ning Airport — a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.\n\n\nIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.[57]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qinghai Lake.\nMany tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.\n\n\nDuring the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.\n\n\nQinghai Lake (青海湖; *qīnghǎi hú*) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the \"Roof of the World\", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (鸟岛; *niǎo dǎo*). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)China National Highway 109 in Qinghai\nThe Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.\n\n\nConstruction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.\n\n\nSix National Highways run through the province.\n\n\nXining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province’s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.[58]\n\n\n\n## Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications industry in China\n\nSince the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its \"Access to Telephones Project\", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.\n\n\nSatellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[*citation needed*] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.\n\n\n\n## Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Qinghai.\n\n* Qinghai University (青海大学)\n* Qinghai Normal University (青海师范大学)\n* Qinghai University for Nationalities (青海民族大学)\n* Qinghai Medical College (青海医学院)\n* Qinghai Radio & Television University (青海广播电视大学)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2010 Yushu earthquake\n* Amdo\n* Geladandong\n* Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)\n* Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)\n* *Iris qinghainica* (native plant of Qinghai)\n* Major national historical and cultural sites in Qinghai\n* Tectonic summary of Qinghai\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Qinghai Province\".

It is often assumed that this current policy [of not politically uniting all ethnically Tibetan areas] reflects the PRC leadership's intention to divide and rule Tibet, but this assumption is not wholly accurate.... The PRC cemented the [historical] status quo by keeping Amdo/Qinghai as a separate, multinational province... China does not reverse perceived territorial acquisitions. Hence, all territories that escaped the domination of Lhasa in recent history remained attached to the neighboring Chinese constituencies they tended to be under the influence of.\n30. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lahtinen, Anja (2009). \"Maximising Opportunities for the Tibetans of Qinghai Province, China\".

Private investment and exports are the main drivers of economic growth in China; but the Chinese government has also emphasized domestic consumption.[36]\n\n\nChina is the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods.[37] It is also the world's fastest-growing consumer market and second-largest importer of goods.[38] China is also the world's largest consumer of numerous commodities, and accounts for about half of global consumption of metals.[39] China is a net importer of services products.[40] It is the largest trading nation in the world and plays a prominent role in international trade.[41][42] China is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world as of 2020, receiving inflows of $163 billion.[43] It has the second largest outward foreign direct investment, at US$136.91 billion for 2019 alone, following Japan at US$226.65 billion for the same period.[44] As of 2022, China was second in the world in total number of billionaires.[45] In 2018, it was second in millionaires with 3.5 million.[46] According to the 2019 Global Wealth Report by Credit Suisse Group, China surpassed the US in the wealth of the top ten percent of the world's population.[47][note 5] China has the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $3.1 trillion,[48] but if the foreign assets of China's state-owned commercial banks are included, the value of China's reserves rises to nearly $4 trillion.[49] China faced a mild economic slowdown during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and initiated a massive stimulus package, which helped to regain its economic growth.\n\n\nWith 778 million workers, the Chinese labor force was the world's largest as of 2020. It ranks 28th on the Global Competitiveness Report.[50] Per the Global Innovation Index in 2022, China was ranked 11th in the world, 3rd in Asia & Oceania region and 2nd for countries with a population of over 100 million. It is the only middle-income economy and the only newly industrialized economy in the top 30.[51][52] It is often ranked among the world's most innovative countries, leading several measures of global patent filings.[53][54] China has the second-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $17.9 trillion as of 2021.[55] It also has two (Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing in the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively) of the global top 5 science and technology clusters, which is more than any other country.[51][56] As of March 2022, China has over 500 million 5G users and 1.45 million base stations installed.[57][58] Almost 493 million Chinese people are categorized as middle class, and 242 million are upper middle class, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey.[59] In 2022, mainland China's ten largest trading partners were European Union, United States, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, and Russia.[60]\n\n\nChina has free trade agreements with many nations, some of which are already in force (such as RCEP, the largest trade bloc in history) or are still in the negotiation phase.[61] Although widely regarded as the \"powerhouse of manufacturing\" or \"the factory of the world\",[62] exports contribute only a comparatively small proportion of the Chinese economy, at just 18.5% in 2020. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 142 are headquartered in China.[63] It has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers[64] and three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (both by market capitalization and by trade volume).[65] China's economy is both a contributor to rising global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions causing climate change and severely affected by its adverse impacts, although its per capita emissions are still much lower than developed economies such as the United States.[66]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economic history of China before 1912, Economic history of China (1912–1949), and Economic history of China (1949–present)\n\n![](image)GDP per capita in China from 1000 to 2018\nHistorically, China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.[34][67][68][69][70] China accounted for around one-quarter of the global GDP until the late 1700s and approximately one-third of the global GDP in 1820 as the Industrial Revolution was beginning in Great Britain.[71][72][73][74] China's GDP in 1820 was six times as large as Britain's, the largest economy in Europe – and almost twenty times the GDP of the nascent United States.[75]\n\n\nAt the end of the Chinese Civil War, the economy was devastated.[76] As the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan, they stripped China of liquid assets including gold, silver, and the country's dollar reserves.[76] By the time the KMT was defeated, commerce had been destroyed, the national currency rendered valueless, and the economy was based on barter.[76]\n\n\nThe People's Republic of China's development from one of the poorest countries to one of the largest economies was the quickest of any country.[77]: 11 From 1949 until the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the economy was state-led with market activity remaining underground.[78] Economic reforms began under Deng Xiaoping.[78] China subsequently became the world's fastest-growing major economy, with growth rates averaging 10% over 30 years.[79][80] Many scholars consider the Chinese economic model as an example of authoritarian capitalism,[81][82] state capitalism[83] or party-state capitalism.[84][85]\n\n\nChina has sustained growth due to export relations, its manufacturing sector, and low-wage workers.[6] China's was the only major world economy to experience GDP growth in 2020, when its GDP increased by 2.3%.[86] However, it posted one of its worst economic performances in decades because of COVID-19 in 2022.[87] In 2023, IMF predicted China to continue being one of the fastest growing major economies.[88]\n\n\n\n## Wealth in China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP, List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita, and List of Chinese prefecture-level cities by GDP per capita\n\nChina has had the world's largest middle class population since 2015,[89] and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018[*citation needed*] and is projected to reach 1.2 billion by 2027, making up one fourth of the world total.[90] As of 2018, China was first in the world in total number of billionaires and second in millionaires – there were 658 Chinese billionaires[91] and 3.5 million millionaires.[92] In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[93][94] In other words, as of 2019, a hundred million Chinese are in the top ten percent of the wealthiest individuals in the world – those who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000.[95] In 2020, China has the world's highest number of billionaires, which is more than the US and India combined,[96] and as of March 2021, the number of billionaires in China reach 1,058 with the combined wealth of US$4.5 trillion.[97] According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, China is home to six of the world's top ten cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Hangzhou and Guangzhou in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more than any other country.[97] As of January 2021, China had 85 female billionaires, two-thirds of the global total.[98]\n\n\n\n## Regional economies for China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Megalopolises in China and List of cities in China\n\n![](image)Distribution of GDP in mainland China\nChina's unequal transportation system, combined with important differences in the availability of natural and human resources and in industrial infrastructure, has produced significant variations in the regional economies of China.[99]\n\n\nEconomic development has generally been more rapid in coastal provinces than in the interior and there are large disparities in per capita income between regions. The three wealthiest regions are the Yangtze River Delta in East China; the Pearl River Delta in South China; and Jingjinji region in North China. It is the rapid development of these areas that is expected to have the most significant effect on the Asian regional economy as a whole and Chinese government policy is designed to remove the obstacles to accelerated growth in these wealthier regions. By 2035, China's four cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) are projected to be among the global top ten largest cities by nominal GDP according to a report by Oxford Economics.[100]\n\n\n\n### GDP by administrative division[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP\n\n\n\n\nList of 31 provinces in mainland China by Nominal GDP in 2022 (billions of GDP)[3]\n| provinces | CN¥ | US$ | share (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China(mainland) | 121,020.72 | 17,992.70 | 100\n |\n| Guangdong | 12,911.86 | 1,919.67 | 10.67\n |\n| Jiangsu | 12,287.56 | 1,826.85 | 10.15\n |\n| Shandong | 8,743.51 | 1,299.94 | 7.22\n |\n| Zhejiang | 7,771.54 | 1,155.43 | 6.42\n |\n| Henan | 6,134.51 | 912.05 | 5.07\n |\n| Sichuan | 5,674.98 | 843.73 | 4.69\n |\n| Hubei | 5,373.49 | 798.90 | 4.44\n |\n| Fujian | 5,310.99 | 789.61 | 4.39\n |\n| Hunan | 4,867.04 | 723.61 | 4.02\n |\n| Anhui | 4,504.50 | 669.70 | 3.72\n |\n| Shanghai | 4,465.28 | 663.87 | 3.69\n |\n| Hebei | 4,237.04 | 629.94 | 3.50\n |\n| Beijing | 4,161.10 | 618.65 | 3.44\n |\n| Shaanxi | 3,277.27 | 487.25 | 2.71\n |\n| Jiangxi | 3,207.47 | 476.87 | 2.65\n |\n| Chongqing | 2,912.90 | 433.07 | 2.41\n |\n| Liaoning | 2,897.51 | 430.79 | 2.39\n |\n| Yunnan | 2,895.42 | 430.48 | 2.39\n |\n| Guangxi | 2,630.09 | 391.03 | 2.17\n |\n| Shanxi | 2,564.26 | 381.24 | 2.12\n |\n| Inner Mongolia | 2,315.87 | 344.31 | 1.91\n |\n| Guizhou | 2,016.46 | 299.80 | 1.67\n |\n| Xinjiang | 1,774.13 | 263.77 | 1.47\n |\n| Tianjin | 1,631.13 | 242.51 | 1.35\n |\n| Heilongjiang | 1,590.10 | 236.41 | 1.31\n |\n| Jilin | 1,307.02 | 194.32 | 1.08\n |\n| Gansu | 1,120.16 | 166.54 | 0.93\n |\n| Hainan | 681.82 | 101.37 | 0.56\n |\n| Ningxia | 506.96 | 75.37 | 0.42\n |\n| Qinghai | 361.01 | 53.67 | 0.30\n |\n| Tibet | 213.26 | 31.71 | 0.18\n |\n\n\n### Hong Kong and Macau[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Hong Kong and Economy of Macau\n\nIn accordance with the one country, two systems policy, the economies of the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portuguese colony of Macau formally preserve a capitalist system separate from mainland China.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of administrative divisions of Greater China by Human Development Index\n\n![](image)China and other major developing economies by GDP per capita at purchasing-power parity (1990–2013) as the rapid economic growth of China (blue) is readily apparent[103]\nThe economic reforms implemented in 1978 helped to propel China into the ranks of the world's major economic powers. The economic development of Shenzhen has caused the city to be referred to as the world's next Silicon Valley.[104][105] The provinces in the coastal regions of China, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong, tend to be more industrialized while regions in the hinterland are less developed.\n\n\n\n![](image)China vs World by Nominal GDP per capita in 2020[106]\nTo guide economic development, the Chinese central government adopts \"five-year plans\" that detail its economic priorities and essential policies. The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) is currently being implemented, placing an emphasis on consumption-driven growth and technological self-sufficiency while China transitions from being an upper middle-income economy to a high-income economy.[107]\n\n\nThe public sector plays a central role in China's economy.[108] This development is also in line with the planning goals of the Chinese central government to achieve the \"Two Centenaries\", namely the material goal of China becoming a \"moderately prosperous society in all respects\" by 2021 and the modernization goal of China becoming a \"strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and modern socialist country\" by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.[109] China retains state control over the commanding heights of the economy in key industries like infrastructure, telecommunications, and finance despite significant marketization of the economy since reform and opening up.[110]: 20 Specific mechanisms implementing its control of the commanding heights in these areas include public property rights, pervasive administrative involvement, and Communist Party supervision of senior managers.[110]: 20\n\n\n\n![](image)Worlds regions by total wealth (in trillions USD), 2018\n![](image)China's share of global export 1990–2019\nLike Japan and South Korea before it, China's economy has grown rapidly, raising the income levels and living standards of its citizens while producing goods that are consumed globally. China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[111][112]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.[113] Between 1981 and 2019, the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty decreased from 88.1% to 0.2%.[5] Its current account surplus increased by a factor of 53 between 1982 and 2021, from $5.67 billion to $317 billion.[114] During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like clothing and footwear to the increasingly sophisticated production of computers, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. China's factories generated $3.7 trillion real manufacturing value added, more than the US, South Korea, Germany and the UK combined. China's manufacturing sector benefits from the world's largest domestic market, immense manufacturing scale, and highly developed manufacturing supply chains.[115]\n\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing. The measures included plans to build a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the Yangtze River.[116]\n\n\nIn terms of domestic saving, defined as combined saving of households, businesses, and governments, China is the world's largest saving country as of at least 2022.[117]: 27\n\n\n\n### Disputes over economic data[edit]\n\n\nThere exists disputes over reliability of official economic data. Foreign and some Chinese sources have claimed that official Chinese government statistics overstate China's economic growth.[118] However, several Western academics and institutions have stated that China's economic growth is higher than indicated by official figures.[119] Others, such as the Economist Intelligence Unit, state that while there's evidence China's GDP data is \"smoothed\", they believe that China's nominal and real GDP data are broadly accurate.[120]\n\n\n\n#### Overestimating[edit]\n\n\nChinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking their numbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose performance are often assessed based on how well their respective economies have performed.[121] Local governments have come under increased scrutiny over the last few years over economic data, with CCP general secretary Xi Jinping stating that economic data forgery \"not only hurt our judgment of the economic situation, but also seriously undermined the Communist Party’s ideas and truth-seeking style\".[118][122]\n\n\nA 2015 survey by *The Wall Street Journal* of 64 select economists found that 96% of respondents think China's GDP estimates don't \"accurately reflect the state of the Chinese economy.\"[123] However, more than half the economists in the survey estimated that China's annual growth was somewhere in the 5% to 7% range, which represents robust growth. During his tenure in Liaoning, future Chinese premier Li Keqiang has said he is far from confident in the country's GDP estimates, calling them \"man-made\" and unreliable, according to a leaked document from 2007 obtained by WikiLeaks. He said government data releases, especially the GDP numbers, should be used \"for reference only\".[124]\n\n\nIn 2016, analysts like Wilbur Ross and Donald Straszheim believed China's economic growth had been overstated, and estimate a growth rate at around 4% or less.[125] According to Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Michael Zheng Song, an economics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and coauthors, China's economy was smaller than what the Chinese government stated in 2016. In their research paper, published by the Brookings Institution in 2019, they adjusted the historical GDP time series using value-added tax data, which they said are \"highly resistant to fraud and tampering\".[126][127] They found that China's economic growth may have been overstated by 1.7 percent each year between 2008 and 2016, meaning that the government may have been overstating the size of the Chinese economy by 12–16 percent in 2016.[127][128]\n\n\n\n#### Underestimating[edit]\n\n\nSeveral Western academics and institutions have supported the claim that China's economy is likely to be underestimated.[129][130][131][119][132][133][134] A paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research claimed that China's economic growth may be higher than what is reported by official statistics.[135] An article by Hunter Clarka, Maxim Pinkovskiya and Xavier Sala-i-Martin published by the Elsevier Science Direct in 2018 employs an innovative method of satellite-recorded nighttime lights, which the authors claim to be a best-unbiased predictor of the economic growth in Chinese cities. The results suggest that the Chinese economic growth rate is higher than the official reported data.[129]\n\n\nThe Li Keqiang index is an alternative measurement of Chinese economic performance that uses three variables Li preferred.[136] Satellite measurements of light pollution are used by some analysts to model Chinese economic growth and suggest growth rate numbers in Chinese official data are more reliable, though are likely to be smoothed.[137] According to an article by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, China's official statistics are of a high quality compared to other developing, middle-income and low-income countries. In 2016, China was at the 83rd percentile of middle and low-income countries, up from the 38th percentile in 2004.[138] A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that China's official GDP statistics are \"significantly and positively correlated\" with externally verifiable measures of economic activity such as import and export data from China's trade partners, suggesting that China's economic growth was no slower than the official figures indicated.[119]\n\n\nThe study by Daniel Rosen and Beibei Bao, published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2015, showed that GDP in 2008 was actually 13–16 percent bigger than the official data, while 2013 GDP was accurately at $10.5 trillion rather than the official figure at $9.5 trillion.[132] According to a research conducted by Arvind Subramanian, a former economist at the International Money Fund (IMF) and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the size of the Chinese economy by Purchasing Power Parity in 2010 was about $14.8 trillion rather than an official estimate at $10.1 trillion by IMF, meaning that China's GDP was underestimated by 47 percent.[139]\n\n\n\n### Regional development[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |  | The East Coast(w/ existing development programmes) |\n|  |  | \"Rise of Central China\"\n |\n|  |  | \"Revitalize Northeast China\"\n |\n|  |  | \"China Western Development\"\n |\n\n\nThese strategies are aimed at the relatively poorer regions in China in an attempt to prevent widening inequalities:\n\n\n\n* China Western Development, designed to increase the economic situation of the western provinces through investment and development of natural resources.\n* Revitalize Northeast China, to rejuvenate the industrial bases in Northeast China.

1987–2022\nDuring the winter of 2007–2008, inflation ran about 7% on an annual basis, rising to 8.7% in statistics for February 2008, released in March 2008.[141][142][143]\n\n\nShortages of gasoline and diesel fuel developed in the fall of 2007 due to reluctance of refineries to produce fuel at low prices set by the state. These prices were slightly increased in November 2007 with fuel selling for $2.65 a gallon, still slightly below world prices. Price controls were in effect on numerous basic products and services, but were ineffective with food, prices of which were rising at an annual rate of 18.2% in November 2007.[144][145] The problem of inflation has caused concern at the highest levels of the Chinese government. On 9 January 2008, the government issued the following statement on its official website: \"The Chinese government decided on Wednesday to take further measures to stabilize market prices and increase the severity of punishments for those guilty of driving up prices through hoarding or cheating.\"[146][147]\n\n\nPork is an important part of the Chinese economy with a per capita consumption of 90 grams per day. The worldwide rise in the price of animal feed associated with increased production of ethanol from corn resulted in steep rises in pork prices in China in 2007. Increased cost of production interacted badly with increased demand resulting from rapidly rising wages. The state responded by subsidizing pork prices for students and the urban poor and called for increased production. Release of pork from the nation's strategic pork reserve was considered.[148]\n\n\nBy January 2008, the inflation rate rose to 7.1%, which BBC News described as the highest inflation rate since 1997, due to the winter storms that month.[149] China's inflation rate jumped to a new decade high of 8.7 percent in February 2008 after severe winter storms disrupted the economy and worsened food shortages, the government said 11 March 2008.[150] Throughout the summer and fall, however, inflation fell again to a low of 6.6% in October 2008.[151]\n\n\nBy November 2010, the inflation rate rose up to 5.1%, driven by an 11.7% increase in food prices year on year. According to the bureau, industrial output went up 13.3 percent. As supplies have run short, prices for fuel and other commodities have risen.[152]\n\n\n\n### Investment cycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Financial Street\nChinese investment has always been highly cyclical.[153] Ever since the 1958 Great Leap Forward, growth in fixed capital formation has typically peaked about every five years. Peaks occurred in 1978, 1984, 1988, 1993, 2003 and 2009. The corresponding troughs were in 1981, 1986, 1989, 1997 and 2005.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn China, the majority of investment is carried out by entities that are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are under the control of local governments. Thus, booms are primarily the result of perverse incentives at the local-government level.[154] Unlike entrepreneurs in a free-enterprise economy, Chinese local officials are motivated primarily by political considerations. As their performance evaluations are based, to a large extent, on GDP growth within their jurisdictions, they have a strong incentive to promote large-scale investment projects.[155][156]\n\n\nA typical cycle begins with a relaxation of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions.[157] The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as was the case in 2003).[158] Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular types of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.[159]\n\n\n\n## Macroeconomic issues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese economic reform\n\n### Environmental transition[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental policy in China, Water supply and sanitation in China, and health in China\n\n![](image)Historical annual CO2 emissions for the top six countries and confederations\nOver the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure of certain commodities and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s.[160]\n\n\nBy 2010, rapidly rising wages and a general increase in the standard of living had put increased energy use on a collision course with the need to reduce carbon emissions in order to control global warming.[161] There were diligent efforts to increase energy efficiency and increase use of renewable sources; over 1,000 inefficient power plants had been closed, but projections continued to show a dramatic rise in carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.[162] Since the late 2010s, a reduction of state-backed subsidies has negatively impacted several Chinese companies, with BYD Auto being one of them.[163][164][165][166]\n\n\nWhile not the largest source of historical cumulative emissions, today China accounts for one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.[167] On a per capita basis, China's emissions in 2019 (9 tonnes CO2-equivalent [tCO2e] per year) surpass those of the European Union (7.6 tCO2e) but remain slightly below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average (10.7 tCO2e) and well below the United States average (17.6 tCO2e). However, the carbon intensity of China's GDP—the amount of carbon used to generate a unit of output—remains relatively high.[66] To avoid the long-term socioeconomic cost[168] of environmental pollution in China,[169][170] it has been suggested by Nicholas Stern and Fergus Green of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment that the economy of China be shifted to more advanced industrial development with low carbon dioxide emissions and better allocation of national resources to innovation and R&D for sustainable economic growth in order to reduce the impact of China's heavy industry. This is in accord with the planning goals of the central government.[171] Chinese leader and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream is described as achieving the \"Two Centenaries\", namely the material goal of China becoming a \"moderately prosperous society\" by 2021, and the modernization goal of China becoming a fully developed nation by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.[172]\n\n\n\n### National debt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National debt of China\n\nIn 2022, China's total government debt stood at approximately CN¥ 94 trillion (US$ 14 trillion), equivalent to about 77.1% of GDP.[140] In 2014, many analysts expressed concern over the overall size of China's government debt.[173][174][175][176] At the end of 2014, the International Monetary Fund reported that China's general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio was 41.44 percent.[177][178] In 2015, a report by the International Monetary Fund concluded that China's public debt is relatively low \"and on a stable path in all standard stress tests except for the scenario with contingent liability shocks\", such as \"a large-scale bank recapitalization or financial system bailout to deal, for example, with a potential rise in NPLs from deleveraging\".[179]\n\n\nChinese authorities have dismissed analysts' worries, insisting \"the country still has room to increase government debt.\"[180] Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, earlier in 2016, commented that \"the ... debt pile facing China [is] an 'internal' problem, given the majority of the borrowings was issued in local currency.[181] Many economists have expressed the same views as Bernanke.[182] A 2019 survey by the OECD found that China's corporate debt is higher than other major countries.[183]\n\n\n\"Shadow banking\" has risen in China, posing risks to the financial system.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Regulatory environment and government revenues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxation in China\n\nThough China's economy has expanded rapidly, its regulatory environment has not kept pace. Since Deng Xiaoping's open market reforms, the growth of new businesses has outpaced the government's ability to regulate them. This has created a situation where businesses, faced with mounting competition and poor oversight, take drastic measures to increase profit margins, often at the expense of consumer safety. This issue became more prominent in 2007, with a number of restrictions being placed on problematic Chinese exports by the United States.[186]\n\n\n\n## Financial and banking system[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China bond yields 30 year bond\n 10 year bond\n 2 year bond\n 1 year bond\n\nMain articles: Banking in China, Foreign-exchange reserves of China, Hedge fund industry in China, and China Venture Capital Association\n\nChina has the world's largest total banking sector assets of around $45.838 trillion (309.41 trillion CNY) with $42.063 trillion in total deposits and other liabilities.[187][188] Most of China's financial institutions are state-owned and governed.[189] The chief instruments of financial and fiscal control are the People's Bank of China (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance, both under the authority of the State Council. The People's Bank of China replaced the Central Bank of China in 1950 and gradually took over private banks. It fulfills many of the functions of other central and commercial banks. It issues the currency, controls circulation, and plays an important role in disbursing budgetary expenditures. Additionally, it administers the accounts, payments, and receipts of government organizations and other bodies, which enables it to exert thorough supervision over their financial and general performances in consideration of the government's economic plans. The PBC is also responsible for international trade and other overseas transactions. Remittances by overseas Chinese are managed by the Bank of China (BOC), which has a number of branch offices in several countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther financial institutions that are crucial, include the China Development Bank (CDB), which funds economic development and directs foreign investment; the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), which provides for the agricultural sector; the China Construction Bank (CCB), which is responsible for capitalizing a portion of overall investment and for providing capital funds for certain industrial and construction enterprises; and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which conducts ordinary commercial transactions and acts as a savings bank for the public.[*citation needed*] China initiated the founding of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015 and the Silk Road Fund in 2014, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[190]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)\nChina's economic reforms greatly increased the economic role of the banking system. In theory any enterprises or individuals can go to the banks to obtain loans outside the state plan, in practice, 75% of state bank loans go to State Owned Enterprises. (SOEs)[191] Even though nearly all investment capital was previously provided on a grant basis according to the state plan, policy has since the start of the reform shifted to a loan basis through the various state-directed financial institutions. It is estimated that, as of 2011, 14 trillion Yuan in loans was outstanding to local governments. Much of that total is believed by outside observers to be nonperforming.[192] Increasing amounts of funds are made available through the banks for economic and commercial purposes. Foreign sources of capital have also increased. China has received loans from the World Bank and several United Nations programs, as well as from countries (particularly Japan) and, to a lesser extent, commercial banks. Hong Kong has been a major conduit of this investment, as well as a source itself. On 23 February 2012, the PBC evinced its inclination to liberalize its capital markets when it circulated a telling ten-year timetable.[193] Following on the heels of this development, Shenzhen banks were able to launch cross-border yuan remittances for individuals, a significant shift in the PBC's capital control strictures since Chinese nationals had been previously barred from transferring their yuan to overseas account.[194]\n\n\nChina has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen), more than any other country.[64] China has three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen), both by market capitalization and by trade volume.[65][195] As of 12 October 2020, the total market capitalization of mainland Chinese stock markets, consisting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, topped US$10 trillion, excluding the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with about US$5.9 trillion.[196]\n\n\nAs of the end of June 2020, foreign investors had bought a total of US$440 billion in Chinese stocks, representing about 2.9% of the total value, and indicating that foreign investors scooped up a total of US$156.6 billion in the stocks just in the first half of 2020.[197] The total value of China's bond market topped US$15.4 trillion, ranked above that of Japan and the U.K., and second only to that of the U.S. with US$40 trillion, as of the beginning of September 2020.[198] As of the end of September 2020, foreign holdings of Chinese bonds reached US$388 billion, or 2.5%, of the total value, notwithstanding an increase by 44.66% year on year.[199]\n\n\n\n### Stock markets[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Composite Index 1991–2022\nChina's stock market exchanges include the Beijing Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (including the STAR Market), the Shenzen Stock Exchange, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. China's stock market is relatively underdeveloped compared to other aspects of its economy.[200]: 148–150\n\n\nTo be listed on China's stock exchange, companies must demonstrate good financial standing (including sustained profitability), solid corporate governance (for example, with a board of independent directors, supervisory board, auditing, and no history of misreporting or fraud) and have a market capitalization equivalent to at least US$4 million.[86]: 271–272\n\n\nWhen the stock markets re-opened in the PRC period in 1990, most of the listed companies were state-owned enterprises; this was part of an experiment in subjecting SOEs to market discipline.[200]: 152–153 The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were under municipal control and termed \"experimental points\" until 1997.[201]: 102–103 In 1997, the central government brought the exchanges under central government control and affirmed that the exchanges had a legitimate role in the socialist market economy.[201]: 102\n\n\nIn 2015, a stock market plunge in China eliminated $2 trillion of global stock market value.[200]: 147\n\n\n\n### Currency system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Renminbi\n\n![](image)USD/CNY exchange rate 1981–2022\nThe renminbi (\"people's currency\") is the currency of China, denominated as the yuan, subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. The ISO 4217 abbreviation is CNY, although also commonly abbreviated as \"RMB\". As of 2005, the yuan was generally considered by outside observers to be undervalued by about 30–40%.[202][203] However, in 2017, the IMF stated that the yuan was correctly valued.[204]\n\n\nThe renminbi is held in a floating exchange-rate system managed primarily against the US dollar. On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe rate of exchange (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's balance of trade, inflation, measured by the consumer price index and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's central bank has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.[205] An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.[206]\n\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.[207] The devaluation was accomplished by pegging the official rate to closing market rates. A market-based \"representative\" exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for designation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals.[208] Since the late-2000s, China has sought to internationalize the renminbi. As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most widely traded currency in the world.[209] In November 2015 in advance of G-20 and IMF meetings, IMF director Christine Lagarde announced her support for adding the yuan to the SDR currency basket. The announcement gave 'green-light' to official approval at 30 November IMF meeting.[210] The internationalization of the Chinese economy continues to affect the standardized economic forecast officially launched in China by the Purchasing Managers Index in 2005. As China's economy grows, so does China's Renminbi, which undergoes the process needed for its internationalization.[211]\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Fortune Global, of the world's 500 largest companies, 145 are headquartered in China.[212] As of 2022, China was home to 351 largest listed companies measured by revenue in the Fortune Global 2000, ranking second globally.[213] China is also home to more than two hundred privately held technology startups (tech unicorns), each with a valuation of over $1 billion, the highest number in the world.[214]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Virtually all arable land is used for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is among the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish. Major non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds, furnish China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high because of intensive cultivation, for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total, but China still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United States. China hopes to further increase agricultural production through improved plant stocks, fertilizers, and technology.\n\n\nAccording to the government statistics issued in 2005,[215] after a drop in the yield of farm crops in 2000, output has been increasing annually.\n\n\n\n![](image)Production of wheat from 1961 to 2004 (data from FAO in 2005, y-axis: production in metric tons)\nAccording to the United Nations World Food Program, in 2022, China fed eighteen percent of the world's population with only seven percent of the world's arable land.[216]\n\n\nAnimal husbandry constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the livestock output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of aquaculture. Pond raising has always been important and has been increasingly emphasized to supplement coastal and inland fisheries threatened by overfishing and to provide such valuable export commodities as prawns. China is also unmatched in the size and reach of its fishing armada with anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 boats, some as far afield as Argentina. Fueled primarily by government subsidies, its growth and activities have largely gone unchecked.[217]\n\n\n\n![](image)Timber transported from a woodlot in the hills of Zhangpu County, Fujian\nEnvironmental problems such as floods, drought, and erosion pose serious threats to farming in many parts of the country. The wholesale destruction of forests gave way to an energetic reforestation program that proved inadequate, and forest resources are still fairly meagre.[218] The principal forests are found in the Qin Mountains and the central mountains and on the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Because they are inaccessible, the Qinling forests are not worked extensively, and much of the country's timber comes from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, and Yunnan.\n\n\nWestern China, comprising Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, has little agricultural significance except for areas of floriculture and cattle raising. Rice, China's most important crop, is dominant in the southern provinces and many of the farms here yield two harvests a year. In the north, wheat is of the greatest importance, while in central China wheat and rice vie with each other for the top place. Millet and kaoliang (a variety of grain sorghum) are grown mainly in the northeast and some central provinces, which, together with some northern areas, also provide considerable quantities of barley. Most of the soybean crop is derived from the north and the northeast; corn (maize) is grown in the center and the north, while tea comes mainly from the warm and humid hilly areas of the south. Cotton is grown extensively in the central provinces, but it is also found to a lesser extent in the southeast and in the north. Tobacco comes from the center and parts of the south. Other important crops are potatoes, sugar beets, and oilseeds.\n\n\n\n![](image)Fish ponds near Daye, Hubei\nIn the past decade, the government has been encouraging agricultural mechanization and land consolidation to raise yields and compensate for the loss of rural workers who have migrated to the cities.[219] According to statistics by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the annual growth rate of agricultural mechanization in China is 6.4%. By 2014, the integrated mechanization rate had risen to nearly 60%, with the rate for wheat surpassing 90% and that for maize approaching 80%.[220] In addition to standard agricultural equipment like tractors, China's agriculture cooperatives have begun using high-tech equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles, which are used to spay crops with pesticides.[221] Good progress has been made in increasing water conservancy, and about half the cultivated land is under irrigation.\n\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms were introduced. First of all this began with the shift of farming work to a system of household responsibility and a phasing out of collectivized agriculture. Later this expanded to include a gradual liberalization of price controls; fiscal decentralization; massive privatization of state enterprises, thereby allowing a wide variety of private enterprises in the services and light manufacturing; the foundation of a diversified banking system (but with large amounts of state control); the development of a stock market; and the opening of the economy to increased foreign trade and foreign investment.\n\n\n\n### Housing and construction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Real estate in China\n\nThe real estate industry is about 20% of the Chinese economy.[222] As of 2023, real property accounts for 60% of Chinese household assets.[200]: 161 Also as of 2023, China has the highest rate of home ownership in the world.[200]: 170 90% of urban households own their home.[200]: 170\n\n\nCompared to other nations, investing in stock markets and other assets is harder due to currency controls within the country. As a result, many Chinese citizens own multiple properties, as they are one of the few ways in which it is comparatively easy to grow and preserve wealth. Due to this, many economists have speculated about a property bubble within the Chinese economy[223] On 16 July 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the housing market within the Chinese economy had grown to US$52 trillion, eclipsing the US 2008 housing market before the Financial Crisis.[224]\n\n\nDespite the possibility of a housing bubble, many people still choose to invest their assets in real estate market. On 19 December 2021, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, China's net worth reached $120 trillion in 2020 to overtake the U.S.'s $89 trillion as a red-hot real estate market drove up property value.[225]\n\n\n\n### Energy and mineral resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy policy of China\n\n![](image)Electricity production in China 1980–2019\n**Electricity:**\n* Production: 6.5 trillion kWh (2017)[226]\n* Consumption: 7.7620 trillion kWh (2020)[3]\n* Exports: 21.8 billion kwh (2020)[3]\n* Imports: 6.2 billion kwh (2015)[3]\n\n\n**Electricity – production by source:**\n\n\n\n* Coal: 61.2% (2022)[227]\n* Hydro: 14.9% (2022)\n* Wind: 9.3 (2022)\n* Solar: 4.7% (2022)\n* Nuclear: 4.7% (2022)\n* Natural gas: 3.1% (2022)\n* Other: 2.1% (2022)\n\n\n**Oil:**\n\n\n\n* Production: 3,527,000 bbl/d (560,700 m3/d) (2022)\n* Consumption: 6,534,000 bbl/d (1,038,800 m3/d) (2005) and expected 9,300,000 bbl/d (1,480,000 m3/d) in 2030\n* Exports: 443,300 bbl/d (70,480 m3/d) (2005)\n* Imports: 10,170,000 bbl/d (1,617,000 m3/d) (2022) [228]\n* Net imports: 2,740,000 barrels per day (436,000 m3/d) (2005)\n* Proved reserves: 16.3 Gbbl (2.59×10~~^~~9 m3) (1 January 2006)\n\n\n**Natural gas:**\n\n\n\n* Production: 47.88 km3 (2005 est.)\n* Consumption: 44.93 km3 (2005 est.)\n* Exports: 2.944 km3 (2005)\n* Imports: 0 m3 (2005)\n* Proved reserves: 1,448 km3 (1 January 2006 est.)\n\nChina has natural resources with an estimated worth of $23 trillion, 90% of which are coal and rare earth metals.[229] Since 1980, China's energy production has grown dramatically, as has the proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang.[230] Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. The northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70–75% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5 million barrels (560,000 m3) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields.[231] Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\n\nSince the early 2000s, China's clean energy sector has rapidly developed.[232]: 23 This growth has enabled renewable energy to have an important role in China's international cooperation, including South-South cooperation in which China is a major source of clean energy technology transfer to other developing countries.[232]: 4, 23\n\n\nThe 11th Five-Year Program (2006–10), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of clean coal technology. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n\nAs of 2021, China is facing its worst energy crisis in decades.[233] *The Guardian* reported that \"Companies in the industrial heartlands have been told to limit consumption, residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts, and annual light shows have been cancelled.\"[234]\n\n\n\n#### Mining[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Gold mining in China\n\nOutdated mining and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques [*citation needed*], but China's rapid industrialization requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from Australia and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as steel production rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon.\n\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were coal (nearly two billion tons), iron ore (310 million tons), crude petroleum (175 million tons), natural gas (41 million cubic meters), antimony ore (110,000 tons), tin concentrates (110,000 tons), nickel ore (64,000 tons), tungsten concentrates (67,000 tons), unrefined salt (37 million tons), vanadium (40,000 tons), and molybdenum ore (29,000 tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were bauxite, gypsum, barite, magnesite, talc and related minerals, manganese ore, fluorspar, and zinc. In addition, China produced 2,450 tons of silver and 215 tons of gold in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n\nIn 2019, the country was the world's largest producer of gold;[235] 3rd largest world producer of copper;[236] 3rd worldwide producer of silver;[237] the world's largest producer of sulfur;[238] the world's largest producer of phosphate;[239] the world's largest producer of molybdenum;[240] the world's largest producer of lead;[241] largest world producer of zinc;[242] the world's largest producer of vanadium;[243] largest world producer of tin;[244] the world's largest producer of titanium;[245] the world's largest producer of antimony;[246] 2nd largest worldwide producer of bauxite;[247] 3rd largest world producer of iron ore;[248] 6th largest world producer of manganese;[249] 7th largest world producer of nickel;[250] 10th largest world producer of cobalt;[251] in addition to being the world's largest producer of salt.[252] It was the world's 8th largest producer of uranium in 2018.[253] Furthermore, it is the largest world producer of jade and one of the world producers of topaz, tourmaline, peridot and diamond.\n  \n\nUntil the end of 2019, a total of 173 types of minerals have been discovered in China, including 13 types of energy materials, 59 metals, 95 types of non-metallic minerals and six types of water and gases. In 2019, the newly discovered geological reserves of oil were 1.12 billion tonnes, of which, 160 million tonnes were proven technically recoverable reserves. The newly discovered geological reserves of shale gas were 764.42 billion cubic meters, of which, 183.84 billion cubic meters were proven reserves. With respect to non-oil and gas minerals, the evaluation states that China has great prospecting potential for 24 major minerals, including coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, copper, lead, zinc, bauxite, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, antimony, nickel, gold, silver, lithium, pyrites, phosphate rock, potash, magnesite, fluorite, boron and barite.[254]\n\n\n\n#### Hydroelectric resources[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydroelectricity in China\n\n![](image)Three Gorges Dam\nChina has an abundant potential for hydroelectric power production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the southwest of the country, where coal supplies are poor but demand for energy is rising swiftly. The potential in the northeast is fairly small, but it was there that the first hydroelectric stations were built – by the Japanese during its occupation of Manchuria.[255]\n\n\nThirteen years in construction at a cost of $24 billion, the immense Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River was essentially completed in 2006 and produced more than 100TWh of energy in 2018.\n\n\n\n#### Coal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coal in China\n\n![](image)Coal mining in Inner Mongolia\nChina is well endowed with mineral resources,[256] the most important of which is coal. China's mineral resources include large reserves of coal and iron ore, plus adequate to abundant supplies of nearly all other industrial minerals. Although coal deposits are widely scattered (some coal is found in every province), most of the total is located in the northern part of the country. The province of Shanxi, in fact, is thought to contain about half of the total; other important coal-bearing provinces include Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, and Shandong.[257] Apart from these northern provinces, significant quantities of coal are present in Sichuan, and there are some deposits of importance in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou.[257] A large part of the country's reserves consists of good bituminous coal, but there are also large deposits of lignite. Anthracite is present in several places (especially Liaoning, Guizhou, and Henan), but overall, it is not very significant.[258]\n\n\nTo ensure a more even distribution of coal supplies and to reduce the strain on the less than adequate transportation network, the authorities pressed for the development of a large number of small, locally run mines throughout the country. This campaign was energetically pursued after the 1960s, with the result that thousands of small pits have been established, and they produce more than half the country's coal. This output, however, is typically expensive and is used for local consumption. It has also led to a less than stringent implementation of safety measures in these unregulated mines, which cause several thousands of deaths each year.[259]\n\n\nCoal makes up the bulk of China's energy consumption (70% in 2005, 55% in 2021), and China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. As China's economy continues to grow, China's coal demand is projected to rise significantly. Although coal's share of China's overall energy consumption will decrease, coal consumption will continue to rise in absolute terms. China's continued and increasing reliance on coal as a power source has contributed significantly to putting China on the path to becoming the world's largest emitter of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.\n\n\nAs of 2015, falling coal prices resulted in layoffs at coal mines in the northeast.[260]\n\n\n\n#### Oil and natural gas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Petroleum industry in China\n\n![](image)Chinese oil reserves\nChina's onshore oil resources are mostly located in the Northeast and in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Oil shale is found in a number of places, especially at Fushun in Liaoning, where the deposits overlie the coal reserves, as well as in Guangdong. High quality light oil has been found in the Pearl River estuary of the South China Sea, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, and the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. The country consumes most of its oil output but does export some crude oil and oil products. China has explored and developed oil deposits in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Bohai Sea.\n\n\nIn 2013, the pace of China's economic growth exceeded the domestic oil capacity and floods damaged the nation's oil fields in the middle of the year. Consequently, China imported oil to compensate for the supply reduction and surpassed the US in September 2013 to become the world's largest importer of oil.[261]\n\n\nThe total extent of China's natural gas reserves is unknown, as relatively little exploration for natural gas has been done.[262] Sichuan accounts for almost half of the known natural gas reserves and production.[263] Most of the rest of China's natural gas is associated gas produced in the Northeast's major oil fields, especially Daqing oilfield. Other gas deposits have been found in the Qaidam Basin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang, and offshore to the southwest of Hainan Island.[264] According to an article published in Energy Economics in 2011 by economists Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich) and Abdul Jalil (Wuhan University in China), financial development in China has not taken place at the expense of environmental pollution and financial development has led to a decrease in environmental pollution. Authors conclude that carbon emissions are mainly determined by income, energy consumption and trade openness and their findings confirm the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve in the case of China.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Metals and nonmetals[edit]\n\n\nIron ore reserves are found in most provinces, including Hainan. Gansu, Guizhou, southern Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces have rich deposits. The largest mined reserves are located north of the Yangtze River and supply neighboring iron and steel enterprises. With the exception of nickel, chromium, and cobalt, China is well supplied with ferroalloys and manganese. Reserves of tungsten are also known to be fairly large. Copper resources are moderate, and high-quality ore is present only in a few deposits. Discoveries have been reported from Ningxia. Lead and zinc are available, and bauxite resources are thought to be plentiful. China's antimony reserves are the largest in the world. Tin resources are plentiful, and there are fairly rich deposits of gold. China is the world's fifth largest producer of gold and in the early 21st century became an important producer and exporter of rare metals needed in high-technology industries.\n\n\nChina also produces a fairly wide range of nonmetallic minerals. One of the most important of these is salt, which is derived from coastal evaporation sites in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning, as well as from extensive salt fields in Sichuan, Ningxia, and the Qaidam Basin. There are important deposits of phosphate rock in a number of areas, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hubei. Production has been accelerating every year. As of 2013 China is producing 97,000,000 metric tons of phosphate rock a year.[266] Pyrites occur in several places; Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have the most important deposits. China also has large resources of fluorite (fluorspar), gypsum, asbestos, and has the world's largest reserves and production of cement, clinker and limestone.\n\n\n\n### Industry and manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n\"Made in China\" redirects here. For other uses, see Made in China (disambiguation).\n\nFurther information: Industry of China and Technological and industrial history of China\n\n![](image)China Railway HXD1B Manufactured by CRRC\n![](image)Fuxing high speed train produced by CRRC\nChina has a strong position global position in the production of industrial goods and some of its companies are global leader in the areas of steel, solar energy, and telecommunications accessories.[267]: 131 As of 2022[update], industry accounts for 39.9% of China's GDP.[3] As of 2023, China manufactures approximately one fifth of the world's total output of industrial products.[267]: 133\n\n\n\n![](image)C919 developed by Chinese aerospace manufacturer Comac\nIn November 2012, the State Council of the People's Republic of China mandated a \"social risk assessment\" for all major industrial projects. This requirement followed mass public protests in some locations for planned projects or expansions.[268]\n\n\nMajor industries include mining and ore processing; iron and steel; aluminium; coal; machinery; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemical; fertilizers; food processing; automobiles and other transportation equipment including rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; consumer products including footwear, toys, and electronics; telecommunications and information technology.\n\n\nSince the founding of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation.[269] Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone now account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output.[270] In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered at the hands of a system that has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than ten percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization.[271]\n\n\nThe predominant focus of development in the chemical industry is to expand the output of chemical fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic fibers. The growth of this industry has placed China among the world's leading producers of nitrogenous fertilizers. In the consumer goods sector the main emphasis is on textiles and clothing, which also form an important part of China's exports. Textile manufacturing, a rapidly growing proportion of which consists of synthetics, account for about ten percent of the gross industrial output and continues to be important, but less so than before. The industry tends to be scattered throughout the country, but there are a number of important textile centers, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Harbin.[272][273] There is a growing consumer culture in China.\n\n\n\n#### Steel industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Steel industry in China, List of steel producers, and List of countries by steel production\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers of Guangzhou\nIn 2020, China produced over 1053 million tonnes of steel, over half of the world total. This was an increase of 5.6% over the previous year as global steel production fell by 0.9%. China's share of global crude steel production increased from 53.3% in 2019 to 56.5% in 2020. Decreasing -2.1% in 2021.[274]\n\n\nIron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140 million tons in 2000 increased to 419 million tons in 2006 and 928 million tons by 2018.\n\n\nChina was the top exporter of steel in the world in 2018; export volumes in 2018 were 66.9 million tons, a nine percent decrease over the previous year. It again decreased in 2021 to 66.2 million tons.[275] The decline slowed China's decade-old steel export growth. As of 2012 steel exports faced widespread anti-dumping taxes and had not returned to pre-2008 levels.[276] Domestic demand remained strong, particularly in the developing west where steel production in Xinjiang was expanding.[277]\n\n\nFor the year 2018, China's steel industry reported profits of CNY 470 billion ($70 billion), which was 39% higher than the year before.[278]\n\n\nOf the 45 largest steel producing companies in the world, 21 are Chinese, including the world's largest, China Baowu Steel Group.\n\n\n\n#### Automotive industry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Automotive industry in China\n\nChina is the world's largest automobile producer, manufacturing more than 27 million vehicles in 2018. For comparison, the corresponding numbers for the US and Japan were 11.3 million and 9.7 million respectively. By 2006 China had become the world's third largest automotive vehicle manufacturer (after US and Japan) and the second largest consumer (only after the US). However, four years later, in 2010, China was manufacturing more vehicles than the U.S. and Japan combined. Automobile manufacturing has soared during the reform period. In 1975 only 139,800 automobiles were produced annually, but by 1985 production had reached 443,377, then jumped to nearly 1.1 million by 1992 and increased fairly evenly each year up until 2001, when it reached 2.3 million. In 2002 production rose to nearly 3.25 million and then jumped to 4.44 million in 2003, 5.07 million in 2004, 5.71 million in 2005, 7.28 million in 2006, 8.88 million in 2007, 9.35 million in 2008 and 13.83 million in 2009. China has become the number-one automaker in the world as of 2009. Domestic sales have kept pace with production. After respectable annual increases in the mid- and late 1990s, passenger car sales soared in the early 2000s.\n\n\nIn 2010, China became the world's largest automotive vehicle manufacturer as well as the largest consumer ahead of the United States with an estimated 18 million new cars sold.[279] However, new car sales grew only by an estimated 1% between 2011 and 2012 due to the escalation in the Spratly Islands dispute, which involved Japan, the world's third largest producer of vehicles.[280]\n\n\nChina's automotive industry has been so successful that it began exporting car parts in 1999. China began to plan major moves into the automobile and components export business starting in 2005. A new Honda factory in Guangzhou was built in 2004 solely for the export market and was expected to ship 30,000 passenger vehicles to Europe in 2005. By 2004, twelve major foreign automotive manufacturers had joint-venture plants in China. They produced a wide range of automobiles, minivans, sport utility vehicles, buses, and trucks. In 2003 China exported US$4.7 billion worth of vehicles and components. The vehicle export was 78,000 units in 2004, 173,000 units in 2005, and 340,000 units in 2006. The vehicle and component export is targeted to reach US$70 billion by 2010.[*citation needed*] China's exports of cars increased significantly since 2020, becoming the world's second-largest exporter of cars in 2022 after Japan.[281]\n\n\nThe market for domestically produced cars, under a local name, is likely to continue to grow both inside China and outside. Companies such as Geely, Qiantu and Chery are constantly evaluating new international locations, both in developing and developed countries.[282]\n\n\n\n#### Electric vehicle industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Electric vehicle industry in China and Plug-in electric vehicles in China\n\n![](image)BYD with Dual Mode hybrid engine\nThe electric vehicle industry in China is the largest in the world, accounting for around 57.4% of global production of EVs and around 500,000 exports in 2021.[283] In 2021, CAAM reported China had sold 3.34 million passenger electric vehicles, consisting 2.73 million BEVs (battery-only EVs) and 0.6 million PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles),[284] which is around 53% share of the global market of 6.23 million \"new energy\" passenger vehicles – BEVs, PHEVs, and HEVs.[285] China also dominates the plug-in electric bus and light commercial vehicle market, reaching over 500,000 buses (98% of global stock) and 247,500 electric commercial vehicles (65% of global stock) in 2019,[286] and recording new sales of 186,000 commercial EVs in 2021.[284]\n\n\nPlug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales was 15% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2021.[287] NEV adoption rapidly increased to a record 28% in March 2022, and according to BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu could reach 35% by end of 2022, exceeding the government goal of 20% by 2025.[288] The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots.[289]\n\n\nThe battery industry is closely related to the EV industry as batteries constitute around 1/3 of the cost of EVs[290] and around 80% of lithium-ion batteries in the world are used in EVs.[291] The industry also has significant Chinese presence, with major players including world's largest CATL, BYD, CALB, Gotion, SVOLT and WeLion.[292]\n\n\n\n#### Semiconductor industry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Semiconductor industry in China\n\nThe Chinese semiconductor industry, including IC design and manufacturing, forms a major part of China's IT industry. China's semiconductor industry consists of a wide variety of companies, from integrated device manufacturers to pure-play foundries to fabless semiconductor companies. Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) design and manufacture integrated circuits. Pure-play foundries only manufacture devices for other companies, without designing them, while fabless semiconductor companies only design devices. Examples of Chinese IDMs are YMTC and CXMT, examples of Chinese pure-play foundries are SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor and Wingtech, and examples of Chinese fabless companies are Zhaoxin, HiSilicon and UNISOC.\n\n\nChina is the currently the world's largest semiconductor market in terms of consumption. In 2020, China represented 53.7% of worldwide chip sales, or $239.45 billion out of $446.1 billion. However, a large percentage are imported from multinational suppliers. In 2020, imports took up 83.38% ($199.7 billion) of total chip sales. In response, the country has launched a number of initiatives to close the gap, including investing $150 billion into its domestic IC industry, with a \"Made in China 2025\" goal of 70% domestic production.[293][294][295]\n\n\nChina leads the world in terms of number of new fabs under construction, with 8 out of 19 worldwide in 2021, and 17 fabs in total are expected to start construction from 2021 to 2023. Total installed capacity of Chinese-owned chipmakers will also increase from 2.96 million wafers per month (wpm) in 2020 to 3.572 million wpm in 2021.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other industries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Electronics industry in China, Pharmaceutical industry in China, and Shipping industry of China\n\nSubstantial investments were made in the manufacture of solar panels and wind generators by a number of companies, supported by liberal loans by banks and local governments. However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to anti-dumping penalties by both the United States and Europe. The global oversupply has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 but, even at the sharply reduced price resulting from oversupply, as of 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Huawei MateBook series at a World Mobile Congress\nChina is the world's biggest sex toy producer and accounts for 70% of the worldwide sex toys production.[297] In the country, 1,000 manufacturers are active in this industry, which generates about two billion dollars a year.[297]\n\n\nAs of 2011, China was the world's largest market for personal computers[298] Since 2019, Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motors, Kia Motors and LG Electronics are moving some or all production out of China, in order to reduce overdependence on the Chinese market and avoid risks related with increased local competition, China's economic slowdown and the US-China trade war.[299]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated shops, rationing, and regulated prices – with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The wholesale and retail trade has expanded quickly, with numerous shopping malls, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas. Public administration remains a main component of the service sector, while tourism has become a significant factor in employment and a source of foreign exchange.[300]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Telecommunications in China and Telecommunications industry in China\n\nThe affordability of mobile phones and internet data in China has resulted in the number of mobile internet users in China surpassing the number of computer internet users.[301]: 178\n\n\nChina's number of Internet users or netizens topped 137 million by the end of 2006,[302] an increase of 23.4% from a year before and 162 million by June 2007, making China the second-largest Internet user after the United States, according to China's Ministry of Information Industry (MII). China's mobile phone penetration rate was 34% in 2007. In 2006, mobile phone users sent 429 billion text messages (on average 967 text messages per user). For 2006, the number of fixed-lines grew by 79%, mainly in the rural areas.[303] By 2021, the number of Internet users in China increased to over 1.05 billion.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer internet[edit]\n\n\nChina's economy is one of the world's leaders in consumer internet and mobile payments.[267]: 130 Mobile payment methods via apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay were quickly adopted in China in part due to the relative lack of credit cards in the country.[267]: 130 This technological leapfrogging also led to a boom in online shopping and retail banking.[267]: 130\n\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in China and List of World Heritage Sites in China\n\nChina hosts the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (55). China's tourism industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the national economy and is also one of the industries with a very distinct global competitive edge. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, travel and tourism directly contributed CNY 1,362 billion (US$216 billion) to the Chinese economy (about 2.6% of GDP).[305] In 2011, total international tourist arrivals was 58 million, and international tourism receipts were US$48 billion.[306]\n\n\nChinese business travel spending is also forecast to be the highest in the world by 2014, overtaking the United States. According to a Global Business Travel Association study, total business-travel spending is expected to reach US$195 billion in 2012.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Luxury goods[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Luxury goods of China\n\nHong Kong and Macau benefit from favorable taxation rules and are favored locations for tourists from elsewhere in China to purchase luxury goods like cosmetics, jewelry, and designer fashion goods.[308]: 116\n\n\nPorcelain has long been one of China's most important luxury exports.[308]: 226 It was especially important to early trade between China and the West, with much of that trade being conducted through Macau.[308]: 226\n\n\nAfter a 2012 ban on government agencies purchasing luxury goods, often used as \"gifts\", sales of luxury goods in China remained strong but slowed, even falling slightly for luxury retailers in the 4th quarter of 2012,[309] with sales of shark fins and edible swallow nests, once staples of lavish government banquets, down sharply.[310]\n\n\nMany shops in international travel destinations have specialized staff devoted to Chinese customers.[309]\n\n\n\n## Labor and welfare[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Labor relations in China and Social welfare in China\n\n![](image)A window washer on a skyscraper in Shanghai\n![](image)A worker makes ceramics in Yunnan\n![](image)A Chinese coal miner at the Jin Hua Gong MineIn 1979–1980, the state reformed factories by giving wage increases to workers, which was immediately offset by sharply rising inflation rates of 6–7%. The reforms also dismantled the iron rice bowl, which meant it witnessed a rise in unemployment in the economy. In 1979–80 there were twenty million unemployed people.[311]\n\n\n![](image)This chart shows the Chinese employment by sectors during time[312]\nChina's estimated employed labor force in 2005 totaled 791 million persons, about 60% of the total population. During 2003, 49% of the labor force worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; 22% in mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction industries; and 29% in the services sector and other categories. In 2004 some 25 million persons were employed by 743,000 private enterprises. Urban wages rose rapidly from 2004 to 2007, at a rate of 13 to 19% per year with average wages near $200/month in 2007.[313] By 2016 the average monthly wage for workers engaged in manufacturing goods for export was $424. This wage, combined with other costs of doing business in China, had, more or less, equalized any Chinese cost advantage with respect to developed economies.[314]\n\n\nThe All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the country's only legally permissible trade union. Attempts to form trade unions independent of the ACFTU have been rare and short-lived. One notable example is the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation formed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Martial Law Command Headquarters issued a public notice declaring the BWAF an illegal organization and ordering it to disband on the grounds that Federation leaders were among \"the main instigators and organizers in the capital of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.[315][316]\n\n\nIn 2010, the issues of manufacturing wages caused a wildcat strike at a Honda parts plant. This resulted in wage increases both at the struck plant and other industrial plants.[317][318][319][320][321]\n\n\nThe 2010 census found that China was now half urban and rapidly aging due to the one child policy. This is expected to lead to increased demand for labor to take care of an elderly population and a reduced supply of migrant labor from the countryside.[322]\n\n\nDue to worsening pollution, the corruption and political uncertainties of the one-party state and the limited economic freedom in an economy dominated by large state-owned enterprises, many skilled professionals are either leaving the country or preparing safety nets for themselves abroad.[323][324][325] In the decade up to 2014, ten million Chinese emigrated to other countries, taking assets and their technical skills.[326]\n\n\nA law approved February 2013 will mandate a nationwide minimum wage at 40% average urban salaries to be phased in fully by 2015.[327]\n\n\n\n## State-owned enterprises[edit]\n\n\nMain article: State-owned enterprises of China\n\nChina's SOEs perform important functions that benefit the state.[328] Academic Wendy Leutert writes, \"They contribute to central and local governments revenues through dividends and taxes, support urban employment, keep key input prices low, channel capital towards targeted industries and technologies, support sub-national redistribution to poorer interior and western provinces, and aid the state's response to natural disasters, financial crises and social instability.\"[328]\n\n\nAs of 2017, China has more SOEs than any other country, and the most SOEs among large national companies.[328] State-owned enterprises accounted for over 60% of China's market capitalization in 2019[329] and generated 40% of China's GDP of US$15.98 trillion dollars (101.36 trillion yuan) in 2020, with domestic and foreign private businesses and investment accounting for the remaining 60%.[330][331] As of the end of 2019, the total assets of all China's SOEs, including those operating in the financial sector, reached US$58.97 trillion In 2015.[332] Ninety-one (91) of these SOEs belong to the 2020 Fortune Global 500 companies.[333]\n\n\n\n## External trade[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of trade of the People's Republic of China\nFurther information: List of the largest trading partners of China, List of exports of China, List of Chinese administrative divisions by exports, and China–United States trade war\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In 2010, China became the world's largest exporter, and has continued to be the world's largest exporter as of at least 2023.[334]: 88 It has free trade agreements with several nations, including ASEAN, Australia, Cambodia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea and Switzerland.[335][336] By 2020, China became the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries.[200]: 228 As of 2022[update], China's largest trading partners are ASEAN, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Russia, Brazil, India, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the Third World was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. However, after Mao Zedong's death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, Hong Kong and Taiwan both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, which promotes free trade and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\n\n\nChina became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001.[337] The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, U.S. exporters continue to have concerns about fair market access due to China's restrictive trade policies and U.S. export restrictions. In October 2019, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng promised to further decrease tariffs and remove non-tariff barriers for global investors, he also welcomed multinational companies to invest more in China.[338]\n\n![](image)With bilateral trade exceeding US$38.6 billion, China is India's largest trading partner[339] and shown here is a Chinese container ship unloading its cargo at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Navi Mumbai, India\nChina's global trade exceeded $4.16 trillion at the end of 2013, having broken the hundred-billion mark in 1988 and half a trillion by 2001. China global trade exceeded US$6 Trillion in 2021[340]\nThe table below shows the average annual growth (in nominal US dollar terms) of China's foreign trade during the reform era:[341]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Two-way trade | Exports | Imports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981–1985 | +12.8% | +8.6% | +16.1%\n |\n| 1986–1990 | +10.6% | +17.8% | +4.8%\n |\n| 1991–1995 | +19.5% | +19.1% | +19.9%\n |\n| 1996–2000 | +11.0% | +10.9% | +11.3%\n |\n| 2001–2005 | +24.6% | +25.0% | +24.0%\n |\n| 2006–2010 | +15.9% | +15.7% | +16.1%\n |\n| 2016–2021 | +11.0% |  |\n\nThe vast majority of China's imports consists of industrial supplies and capital goods, notably machinery and high-technology equipment, the majority of which comes from the developed countries, primarily Japan[*citation needed*] and the United States[*citation needed*]. Regionally, almost half of China's imports come from East and Southeast Asia, and about a fourth of China's exports go to the same destinations[*citation needed*]. About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest ports in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233 billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%. China's share of total U.S. imports has grown from 7% to 15% since 1996.\n\n\nTrade volume between China and Russia reached $29.1 billion in 2005, an increase of 37.1% compared with 2004. A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, Van Jingsun, said that the volume of trade between China and Russia could exceed forty billion dollars in 2007.[342] China's export of machinery and electronic goods to Russia grew 70%, which is 24% of China's total export to Russia in the first eleven months of 2005. During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13 billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05 billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368 million during January–September 2005, twice that in 2004. By 2022, trade between China and Russia reached a record $190 billion,[19] with China becoming Russia's trading partner.[343]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in Nizhny Novgorod, the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its 11th Five-Year Program, adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n\nChina is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free-trade area which was signed into agreement in November 2020. The RCEP, which includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN nations, represents about a third of the world's population and 29% of global gross domestic product. The RCEP aims to eliminate tariffs on a variety of products within 20 years.[344] On 17 September 2021, China formally applied to join another large Asia-Pacific free-trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).[345]\n\n\n\n## Foreign investment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China, Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor, Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, China Investment Promotion Agency, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Ministry of Commerce (China)\n\nIn 2022, China was amongst the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $180 billion, though most of these were speculated to be from Hong Kong.[346] As of the end of June 2020, FDI stock in China reached US$2.947 trillion, and China's outgoing FDI stock stood at US$2.128 trillion. The total foreign financial assets owned by China reached US$7.860 trillion, and its foreign financial liabilities US$5.716 trillion, making China the second largest creditor nation after Japan in the world.[347]\n\n\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms. The Encouraged Industry Catalogue sets out the degree of foreign involvement allowed in various industry sectors. From the beginning of the reforms legalizing foreign investment, capital inflows expanded every year until 1999.[348] Foreign-invested enterprises account for 58–60% of China's imports and exports.[349]\n\n\nSince the early 1990s, the government has allowed foreign investors to manufacture and sell a wide range of goods on the domestic market, eliminated time restrictions on the establishment of joint ventures, provided some assurances against nationalization, allowed foreign partners to become chairs of joint venture boards, and authorized the establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises, now the preferred form of FDI. In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state.\n\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in Shanghai and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of stock in selected companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45 billion in foreign direct investment. China revised significantly its laws on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and China Foreign Equity Joint Ventures in 2000 and 2001. The Vice Minister of Finance Zhu Guangyao announced, foreign investors will be allowed to own up to 51% on domestic financial service companies. Formerly foreign ownership was limited to a 49% stake in these firms.[350]\n\n\nForeign investment remains a strong element in China's rapid expansion in world trade and has been an important factor in the growth of urban jobs. China's economic leadership on global capital flows emphasizes long-term infrastructure and development finance over short-term flows which, under the current order, have imposed large costs on many economies.[351] In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totaled about $145 billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) after the United States, receiving $39 billion in 1999 and $41 billion in 2000. China is now one of the leading FDI recipients in the world, receiving almost $80 billion in 2005 according to World Bank statistics. In 2006, China received $69.47 billion.[352] By 2011, with the U.S. seeing a decline in foreign investment following the 2008 financial crisis, China overtook it as the top destination for FDI, receiving over $280 billion that year.[353]\n\n\nAmid slowing economic conditions and a weakening yuan in 2015, December of that year saw a 5.8% drop in FDI to China.[354] While China's rank as the top receiver of FDI continued through 2014, the slowing of inbound investment in 2015 combined with a massive rebound in foreign investment to the United States resulted in the U.S. reclaiming its position as the top investment destination.[355] Data from the American Chamber of Commerce in China's *2016 China Business Climate Survey* confirms this trend, although it also demonstrates that China remains a top investment destination. This survey of over 500 members found that \"China remains a top three investment priority for six out of ten member companies,\" though this is a decline from the 2012 high of eight out of ten respondents considering China a top priority.[356]\n\n\nForeign exchange reserves totaled $155 billion in 1999 and $165 billion in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves exceeded $800 billion in 2005, more than doubling from 2003. Foreign exchange reserves were $819 billion at the end of 2005, $1.066 trillion at the end of 2006, $1.9 trillion by June 2008. In addition, by the end of September 2008 China replaced Japan for the first time as the largest foreign holder of US treasury securities with a total of $585 billion, vs Japan $573 billion. China's foreign exchange reserves are the largest in the world.[357]\n\n\nAs part of its WTO accession, China undertook to eliminate certain trade-related investment measures and to open up specified sectors that had previously been closed to foreign investment. New laws, regulations, and administrative measures to implement these commitments are being issued. Major remaining barriers to foreign investment include opaque and inconsistently enforced laws and regulations and the lack of a rules-based legal infrastructure. Warner Bros., for instance, withdrew its cinema business in China as a result of a regulation that requires Chinese investors to own at least a 51 percent stake or play a leading role in a foreign joint venture.[358]\n\n\nAnother major development in the history of foreign investment in China was the establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in September 2013.[359] The Zone is considered a testing ground for a number of economic and social reforms.[360][361] Critically, foreign investment is controlled via a \"negative list\" approach, where FDI is permitted in all sectors unless explicitly prohibited by the inclusion of a given sector on the negative list published by the Shanghai Municipal Government.[362]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2019, China's National People's Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law,[363] which comes into effect on 1 January 2020. Foreign investment in China comes with a number of ethical risks which pose major challenges which investors must navigate.[364]\n\n\nA 2021 McKinsey report estimated that the Chinese economy as currently the largest consumer economy measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, and that it is expected to add more consumption than any other country within the next decade. Due to this and the rapid continued growth of China's middle class, large multinational companies like Walmart, have been keen to invest in China to tap into the growing domestic consumer market.[365][366]\n\n\n\n### Chinese investment abroad[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A TCL television set\n![](image)A Meizu smartphone\n![](image)Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nSee also: Go Out policy\n\nOutward foreign direct investment is a new feature of Chinese globalization, where local Chinese firms seek to make investments in both developing and developed countries.[367] It was reported in 2011 that there was increasing investment by capital rich Chinese firms in promising firms in the United States. Such investments offer access to expertise in marketing and distribution potentially useful in exploiting the developing Chinese domestic market.[368]\n\n\nSince 2005, Chinese companies have been actively expanding outside of China, in both developed and developing countries. In 2013, Chinese companies invested US$90 billion globally in non-financial sectors, 16% more than 2012.[369]\n\n\nBetween January 2009 and December 2013, China contributed a total of $161.03bn in outward FDI, creating almost 300,000 jobs. Western Europe was the largest regional recipient of Chinese outward FDI, with Germany receiving the highest number of FDI projects for any country globally.[370]\n\n\nThere are two ways Chinese companies choose to enter a foreign market: organic growth and Merge & Acquisition (M&A). Many Chinese companies would prefer M&A for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Fast. M&A is the fastest way for a company to expand into another country by acquiring brand, distribution, talents, and technology. Chinese CEOs has been used to growing at 50%+ speed and do not want to spend capital.\n* China market. China has become the world's largest economy. Many Chinese acquire foreign companies and then bring their products/services to China, anything from premium cars to fashion clothing to meat to Hollywood movies.\n* Cheap capital access. The huge Chinese domestic market help many Chinese companies accumulated financial capital to do M&A. Chinese government also provides long-term, low-interest capital for companies to expand abroad.\n* Low risk. M&A helped Chinese companies avoid risk of failure of organic growth as they got an established company with everything in place.\n* Cheap labor. Some companies may move part of the manufacturing in high labor cost countries to China to reduce the cost and make the product more attractive in price.\n* Trade and policy barrier. Chinese companies in many sectors face quota limitation and high tax, which prevent them from being competitive in foreign markets.\n* Depressed assets. 2008–2010 global economic crisis created liquidity problems for a lot of western companies and reduced their market value. Chinese companies believe it is a great opportunity for them to buy these depressed assets at discount. China's direct foreign investment in non-financial sector growth from US$25 billion in 2007 to US$90 billion in 2013, more than three times.[371]\n* China is growing in investments and influencing power over Europe, and the EU has begun to take notice.[372]\n\n\nAt the beginning, state-owned enterprises dominate the foreign acquisition and most of the money goes to oil and minerals. Since 2005, more and more private companies start to acquire non-raw material foreign companies. Below is a list of the top 15 outbound deals from Chinese companies:[373]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Acquirer\n | Acquirer industry\n | Target\n | Target industry\n | Target country\n | Deal value in millions of USD\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3 February 2016\n | CNAC Saturn (NL) BV\n | Chemicals\n | Syngenta AG | Chemicals\n | Switzerland\n | 41,840.11\n |\n| 23 July 2012\n | CNOOC Canada Holding Ltd\n | Other financials\n | Nexen Inc | Oil and gas\n | Canada\n | 19,119.31\n |\n| 1 February 2008\n | Shining Prospect Pte Ltd\n | Other financials\n | Rio Tinto PLC | Metals and mining\n | United Kingdom\n | 14,284.17\n |\n| 2 June 2017\n | China Investment Corp\n | Alternative financial investments\n | Logicor Ltd\n | Non residential\n | United Kingdom\n | 13,742.43\n |\n| 14 July 2017\n | Nesta Investment Holdings Ltd\n | Other financials\n | Global Logistic Properties Ltd\n | Non residential\n | Singapore\n | 11,553.58\n |\n| 22 August 2017\n | China Unicom (BVI) Ltd\n | Telecommunications services\n | China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd\n | Telecommunications services\n | Hong Kong\n | 11,255.81\n |\n| 6 October 2016\n | Park Aerospace Holdings Ltd\n | Transportation and infrastructure\n | C2 Aviation Capital LLC\n | Transportation and infrastructure\n | United States\n | 10,380.00\n |\n| 14 October 2015\n | China Tower Corp Ltd\n | Telecommunications services\n | China-Telecommun tower asts\n | Wireless\n | China\n | 9,948.41\n |\n| 21 June 2016\n | Halti SA\n | Other financials\n | Supercell Oy | Software\n | Finland\n | 8,600.00\n |\n| 24 June 2009\n | Mirror Lake Oil & Gas Co Ltd\n | Oil and gas\n | Addax Petroleum Corp\n | Oil and gas\n | Switzerland\n | 7,157.40\n |\n| 1 October 2010\n | China Petrochemical Corporation | Oil and gas\n | Repsol YPF Brasil SA\n | Oil and gas\n | Brazil\n | 7,111.00\n |\n| 16 March 2016\n | Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd\n | Insurance\n | Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc\n | REITs\n | United States\n | 6,500.00\n |\n| 24 October 2016\n | Hna Tourism Grp Co Ltd\n | Travel services\n | Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc | Hotels and lodging\n | United States\n | 6,496.88\n |\n| 17 February 2016\n | Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co Ltd\n | Transportation and infrastructure\n | Ingram Micro Inc. | Computers and peripherals\n | United States\n | 6,067.41\n |\n| 22 March 2015\n | Marco Polo Industrial Hldg SpA\n | Other financials\n | Pirelli & C SpA\n | Automobiles and components\n | Italy\n |  |\n\n\nHowever, the fast growth and M&A deals did not change consumers' low quality and low-price perception of Chinese goods and brands. According to market consecutive research by the Monogram Group, a Chicago-based advertising agency, in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012, American consumers' willingness to purchase Chinese products across all categories except PC remained the same or became worse during 2007–2012. The only sector in which Americans were more likely to purchase was personal computers.[374]\n\n\n\n![](image)China's leader Xi Jinping and Poland's President Andrzej Duda during the inauguration of the China Railway Express in Warsaw, Poland, 20 June 2016\nMoreover, many M&A deals have failed because companies underestimated the challenges and failed to restructure the company.\n\n\nCase 1: Shanghai Auto acquired 48.9% of Korean Ssangyong at US$500 million in 2004, making it the most ambitious acquisition in Chinese auto industry at the time. Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.[375][376]\n\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint venture called TCL–Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n\n\n\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book *Resumption of Trading* by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n\n\n### Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$969 billion.[377]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of China\n\nFurther information: Migration in China, Urbanization in China, Chinese emigration, Standard of living in China, and Poverty in China\n\nSince the 1950s medical care, public hygiene and sanitation improved considerably, and epidemics were controlled. Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The population growth rate surged as the mortality rate dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate, and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958–60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population control drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per family policy was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around a billion, and by the early 2000s surpassed 1.3 billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.[378] China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world.\n\n\nAccording to a Forbes China Rich List (2007), China had 66 billionaires, the second largest number after the United States, which had 415. In the 2006 Forbes Rich List it stated that there were 15 Chinese billionaires.[379] In the 2007 Hurun Report, it lists 106 billionaires in China.[380] According to the latest Forbes report (2021), China has a total of 626 billionaires, after gaining 239 new billionaires since March 2020.[381]\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 Brookings report, China become the largest middle-class consumption market in the world and is deemed a \"priority market\" for major multinational firm. It also estimates that 1.2 billion Chinese will be part of the middle class by 2027, and makeup a quarter of the world's middle class.[382]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to statistics released by China's National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the size of the labor force, people aged 15 to 59, in China shrank slightly to 937.27 million people, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the CCP, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.[383]\n\n\n\n## Transportation and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in China\n\n![](image)Shanghai Maglev Train\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.[384]\n\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet military transport and logistics needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of ocean shipping was broadened considerably.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFreight haulage is mainly provided by rail transport. The rail sector is monopolized by China Railway and there is wide variation in services provided. In late 2007 China became one of the few countries in the world to launch its own indigenously developed high-speed train.[385] As rail capacity is struggling to meet demand for the transport of goods and raw materials such as coal, air routes, roads and waterways are rapidly being developed to provide an increasing proportion of China's overall transportation needs.[386]\n\n\nSome economic experts have argued that the development gap between China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.[387]\n\n\n\n## Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in China\n\n![](image)Tencent, one of the world's most valuable technology conglomerates\nScience and technology in China has in recent decades developed rapidly. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform, and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socio-economic development of the country as well as for national prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, artificial intelligence,[388] academic publishing, patents and commercial applications. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses.

Its border includes two-thirds of the length of China's border with the country of Mongolia. Inner Mongolia also accounts for a small section of China's border with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai). Its capital is Hohhot; other major cities include Baotou, Chifeng, Tongliao, and Ordos.\n\n\nThe autonomous region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former Republic of China provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaobei, and Xing'an, along with the northern parts of Gansu and Ningxia.\n\n\nIts area makes it the third largest Chinese administrative subdivision, constituting approximately 1,200,000 km2 (463,000 sq mi) and 12% of China's total land area. Due to its long span from east to west, Inner Mongolia is geographically divided into eastern and western divisions. The eastern division is often included in Northeastern China (Dongbei), with major cities including Tongliao, Chifeng, Hailar, and Ulanhot. The western division is included in North China, with major cities including Baotou and Hohhot. It recorded a population of 24,706,321 in the 2010 census, accounting for 1.84% of Mainland China's total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's 23rd most populous province-level division.[8] The majority of the population in the region are Han Chinese, with a sizeable Mongol minority close to 5,000,000 (2019) which is the largest Mongolian population in the world (bigger than that of the country Mongolia). Inner Mongolia is one of the more economically developed provinces in China with annual GDP per capita at US$14,343 (2022), ranked 8th in the nation. The official languages are Mandarin and Mongolian, the latter of which is written in the traditional Mongolian script, as opposed to the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet, which is used in the country of Mongolia (formerly often described as Outer Mongolia).\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

Mongolian *dotugadu*/*gadagadu*). Inner Mongolia is distinct from Outer Mongolia, which was a term used by the Republic of China and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent state of Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva in Russia. The term Inner 内 (Nei) referred to the Nei Fan 内藩 (Inner Tributary), i.e., those descendants of Genghis Khan who were granted the title khan (king) in the Ming and Qing dynasties and lived in part of southern Mongolia. The region is sometimes called Southern Mongolia by local separatists and Mongolian irredentists.[9]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Mongolia\n\nMuch of what is known about the history of the Mongolian Plateau is taken from Chinese chronicles and historians. Before the rise of the Mongols in the 13th century, what is now central and western Inner Mongolia, especially the Hetao region, alternated in control between Chinese agriculturalists in the south, and Xiongnu, Xianbei, Khitan, Jurchen, Tujue, and nomadic Mongol of the north. The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different Tungusic and Mongol tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese agriculturalists.\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Han dynasty in Inner Asia and Tang dynasty in Inner Asia\n\nSlab Grave cultural monuments are found in Northern, Central and Eastern Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, North-Western China, Southern, Central-Eastern and Southern Baikal territory. Mongolian scholars prove that this culture related to the Proto-Mongols.[10]\n\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, Central and Western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the Loufan, Linhu and Dí, while Eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the Donghu. During the Warring States period, King Wuling (340–295 BC) of the state of Zhao based in what is now Hebei and Shanxi Provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the Dí state of Zhongshan in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and Loufan and created the Yunzhong Commandery near modern Hohhot. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After Qin Shi Huang created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu from the region and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: Jiuyuan and Yunzhong and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.[11]\n\n\nDuring the Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wu sent the general Wei Qing to reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year, he established the commanderies of Shuofang and Wuyuan in Hetao. At the same time, what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the Xianbei, who would, later on, eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence.\n\n\nDuring the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han dynasty began to be settled in Hetao and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on, during the Western Jin dynasty, it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, Liu Yuan, who established the Han Zhao kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the Sixteen Kingdoms period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes.\n\n\nThe Sui dynasty (581–618) and Tang dynasty (618–907) re-established a unified Chinese empire and like their predecessors, they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the Liao dynasty founded by the Khitans, a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the Western Xia of the Tanguts, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including Western Hetao). The Khitans were later replaced by the Jurchens, precursors to the modern Manchus, who established the Jin dynasty over Manchuria and Northern China.\n\n\n\n### Mongol and Ming periods[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mongol Empire, Mongolia under Yuan rule, Northern Yuan, and Ming dynasty in Inner Asia\n\n![](image)Persian miniature depicting Genghis Khan entering Beijing\n![](image)The Northern Yuan at its greatest extent\nAfter Genghis Khan unified the Mongol tribes in 1206 and founded the Mongol Empire, the Tangut Western Xia empire was ultimately conquered in 1227, and the Jurchen Jin dynasty fell in 1234. In 1271, Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan established the Yuan dynasty. Kublai Khan's summer capital Shangdu (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day Dolonnor. During that time Ongud and Khunggirad peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led Ming dynasty in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and Yingchang. The Ming rebuilt the Great Wall of China at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the Tumu incident in 1449, when the Oirat ruler Esen taishi captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the Northern Yuan dynasty.[12]\n\n\n\n### Qing period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mongolia under Qing rule\n\nThe eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the Khorchin and Southern Khalkha in today's Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the Jurchen tribes until Nurhaci, the founder of the new Jin dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.[13] The Manchus gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when Ligden Khan's son surrendered the Chakhar Mongol tribes to the Manchus. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established Qing dynasty. Under the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), the Mongolian Plateau was administered in a different way for each region:\n\n\n\n![](image)Mongolia plateau during early 17th century\n![](image)Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia within the Qing dynasty, c. 1820\n* \"Outer Mongolia\": This region corresponds to the modern state of Mongolia, plus the Russian-administered region of Tannu Uriankhai, and a part of northern Xinjiang. It included the four leagues (*aimag*) of the Khalkha Mongols north of the Gobi, as well as the Tannu Uriankhai and Khovd regions in northwestern Mongolia, which were overseen by the General of Uliastai from the city of Uliastai.\n* \"Inner Mongolia\": This region corresponded to most of modern Inner Mongolia and some neighbouring areas in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. The banners and tribes in this region came under six leagues (*chuulghan*): Jirim, Juuuda, Josutu, Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Yekejuu.\n* \"Taoxi Mongolia\": The Alashan Öölüd and Ejine Torghuud banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia. This territory is equivalent to modern-day Alxa League, the westernmost part of what is now Inner Mongolia.\n* The Chahar Banners were controlled by the military commander of Chahar (now Zhangjiakou). Their extent corresponded to southern Ulanqab and Bayannur in modern Inner Mongolia, plus the region around Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of Zhili and Shanxi provinces also belonged to this region.\n* The Guihua Tümed banner was controlled by the military commander of Suiyuan (now Hohhot). This corresponds to the vicinities of the modern city of Hohhot. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of modern Shanxi province also belonged to this region.\n* The Hulunbuir region in what is now northeastern Inner Mongolia was part of the jurisdiction of the General of Heilongjiang, one of the three generals of Manchuria.\n\n\nThe Inner Mongolian Chahar leader Ligdan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing. Ejei Khan was given the title of Prince (親王; *qīn wáng*), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrest in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on 20 April 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor, unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\n\nDespite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. As a result, the Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.[14]\n\n\nOrdinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.[15] Mongol pilgrims wanting to leave their banner's borders for religious reasons such as pilgrimage had to apply for passports to give them permission.[16]\n\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, growing numbers of Han Chinese settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791, there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the Front Gorlos Banner that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalise the status of the peasants who had already settled there.[17]\n\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicised and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers.\n\n\nA group of Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty called \"Mongol followers\" immigrated to Inner Mongolia who worked as servants for Mongols and Mongol princes and married Mongol women. Their descendants continued to marry Mongol women and changed their ethnicity to Mongol as they assimilated into the Mongol people, an example of this were the ancestors of Li Shouxin. They distinguished themselves apart from \"true Mongols\" 真蒙古.[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n### Republic of China and the Second World War periods[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mongolia (1911–24), Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Mengjiang, and Mongol United Autonomous Government\n\n![](image)Mongols stand in front of a yurt, 1912\nOuter Mongolia gained independence from the Qing dynasty in 1911, when the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu of the Khalkha was declared the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognised the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernising objectives for Mongolia.[21] Eventually, the newly formed Republic of China promised a new nation of five races (Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Uyghur).[22] and suppressed the Mongol rebellions in the area.[23][24]\n\n\nThe Republic of China reorganised Inner Mongolia into provinces:\n\n\n\n* Rehe province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the Chengde area in what is now northern Hebei.\n* Chahar province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.\n* Suiyuan province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).\n* Hulunbuir stayed within Heilongjiang in Manchuria, which had become a province.\n* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of Fengtian in southern Manchuria.\n* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e., Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring Gansu province. Later on Ningxia province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.\n\n\nSome Republic of China maps still show this structure.\n\n\nThe history of Inner Mongolia during the Second World War is complicated, with Japanese invasion and different kinds of resistance movements. In 1931, Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, taking some Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e., Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were occupied by Manchukuo until the end of World War II in 1945.\n\n\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan openly and fully invaded Republic of China. On 8 December 1937, Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub (also known as \"De Wang\") declared independence for the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e., the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as Mengjiang, and signed agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. Its capital was established at Zhangbei (now in Hebei province), with the Japanese puppet government's control extending as far west as the Hohhot region. The Japanese advance was defeated by Hui Muslim General Ma Hongbin at the Battle of West Suiyuan and Battle of Wuyuan. Since 1945, Inner Mongolia has remained part of China.\n\n\nThe Mongol Ulanhu fought against the Japanese.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delegates of Inner Mongolia People's Congress shouting slogans\nEthnic Mongolian guerrilla units were created by the Kuomintang Nationalists to fight against the Japanese during the war in the late 30s and early 40s. These Mongol militias were created by the Ejine and Alashaa based commissioner's offices created by the Kuomintang.[25][26] Prince Demchugdongrob's Mongols were targeted by Kuomintang Mongols to defect to the Republic of China. The Nationalists recruited 1,700 ethnic minority fighters in Inner Mongolia and created war zones in the Tumet Banner, Ulanchab League, and Ordos Yekejuu League.[25][27]\n\n\nThe Inner Mongolian People's Republic was founded shortly after the Second World War. It existed from 9 September 1945 until 6 November 1945.\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Communist movement gradually gained momentum as part of the Third Communist International in Inner Mongolia during the Japanese period. By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of World War II, the Chinese Communists gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially, the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the People's Republic of China and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in Liaoning province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in Hebei province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, nearly all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was Ulanhu.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.[28] Among the victims in Inner Mongolia, 75 per cent were Mongols, even though they only constituted 10 per cent of the population.[29] In 1969, much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between Heilongjiang and Jilin, Jirim going to Jilin, Juu Uda to Liaoning, and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among Gansu and Ningxia. This decision was reversed in 1979.\n\n\nInner Mongolia has seen considerable development since Deng Xiaoping instituted Chinese economic reform in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2020, large protests broke out in ethnic Mongol communities due to unannounced plans by the Chinese government to phase out Mongolian-medium teaching.[35][36][37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inner Mongolian steppes\n![](image)Topography of Inner Mongolia in China\nOfficially Inner Mongolia is classified as one of the provincial-level divisions of North China, but its great stretch means that parts of it belong to Northeast China and Northwest China as well. It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia,[note 3] which, in Chinese, is sometimes called \"Outer Mongolia\", while a small portion is with Russia's Zabaykalsky Krai.\n\n\nInner Mongolia largely consists of the northern side of the North China Craton, a tilted and sedimented Precambrian block. In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region's highest peak, Main Peak in the Helan Mountains reaches 3,556 metres (11,670 ft), and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.[2] Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around 1,200 metres (3,940 ft) in altitude and covered by extensive loess and sand deposits. The northern part consists of the Mesozoic era Khingan Mountains, and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with Manchurian elm, ash, birch, Mongolian oak and a number of pine and spruce species. Where discontinuous permafrost is present north of Hailar District, forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south, the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.\n\n\nOwing to the ancient, weathered rocks lying under its deep sedimentary cover, Inner Mongolia is a major mining district, possessing large reserves of coal, iron ore and rare-earth minerals, which have made it a major industrial region today.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winter in Ulanbutan Grassland, Hexigten Banner\nDue to its elongated shape, Inner Mongolia has a four-season monsoon climate with regional variations. The winters in Inner Mongolia are very long, cold, and dry with frequent blizzards, though snowfall is so light that Inner Mongolia has no modern glaciers[2] even on the highest Helan peaks. The spring is short, mild and arid, with large, dangerous sandstorms, whilst the summer is very warm to hot and relatively humid except in the west where it remains dry. Autumn is brief and sees a steady cooling, with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) reached in October in the north and November in the south.\n\n\nOfficially, most of Inner Mongolia is classified as either a cold arid or steppe regime (Köppen *BWk, BSk*, respectively). The small portion besides these are classified as humid continental (Köppen *Dwa/Dwb*) in the northeast, or subarctic (Köppen *Dwc*) in the far north near Hulunbuir.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for some locations in Inner Mongolia of China**\n| City\n | July (°C)\n | July (°F)\n | January (°C)\n | January (°F)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baotou | 29.6/17.1 | 85.3/62.8 | −4.1/–16.8 | 24.7/1.8\n |\n| Bayannur | 30.7/17.9 | 87.3/64.2 | −3.3/–15.1 | 26.1/4.8\n |\n| Hohhot | 28.5/16.4 | 83.3/61.5 | −5/–16.9 | 23/1.6\n |\n| Ordos | 26.7/15.8 | 80.1/60.4 | −4.8/–14.7 | 23.4/5.5\n |\n| Ulanqab | 25.4/13.6 | 77.7/56.5 | −6.1/–18.5 | 21/–1.3\n |\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia and List of township-level divisions of Inner Mongolia.\n\nInner Mongolia is divided into twelve prefecture-level divisions. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as *Leagues* (Chinese: 盟), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as *Banners* (Chinese: 旗). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into prefecture-level cities, although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: Hailar, Jining and Dongsheng). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their primate city (Chifeng, Tongliao), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself Ordos. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**↖**\n\n**Hohhot**\n\n**Baotou**\n\n**↗**\n\n**Wuhai**\n\n**Chifeng**\n\n**Tongliao**\n\n**Ordos**\n\n**Hulunbuir**\n\n**Bayannur**\n\n**Ulanqab**\n\n**HingganLeague**\n\n**XilingolLeague**\n\n**AlxaLeague**\n\n**█** **Jiagedaqi Dist. & Songling Dist.is de jure part of Oroqen Aut.

In the more arid grasslands, herding of goats, sheep and so on is a traditional method of subsistence. Forestry and hunting are somewhat important in the Greater Khingan ranges in the east. Reindeer herding is carried out by Evenks in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing grapes and winemaking have become an economic factor in the Wuhai area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Theater in Hohhot\nInner Mongolia has an abundance of resources especially coal, cashmere, natural gas, rare-earth elements, and has more deposits of naturally occurring niobium, zirconium and beryllium than any other province-level region in China. The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[46] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[47] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Inner Mongolia Gymnasium\nIndustry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, power generation, forestry-related industries, and related industries.\nInner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including dairy) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as ERDOS, Yili, and Mengniu. As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.\n\n\nThe GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2022 was CN¥2.3 trillion (US$344 billion in nominal),[5] with an average annual increase of 10% from the period 2010–2015. Its per capita GDP was CN¥96,474 (US$14,343 in nominal), ranking 8th among all the 31 provincial divisions of China.[5] The primary, secondary and tertiary industries contributed ¥265 billion ($39.45 billion), ¥1.12 trillion ($167.1 billion) and ¥926 billion ($137.7 billion) to the GDP respectively.[5]\n\n\nIn addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China[47] thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up wind parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi.\n\n\nEast of Jilantai, Inner Mongolia, there is a ballistic missile training area used by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) to train missile crews for mobile missile launchers, their support vehicles, and silo-based ballistic missiles.[49]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Baotou National Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone[50]\n* Erenhot Border Economic Cooperation Area\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n\n\nHohhot Export Processing Zone was established 21 June 2002 by the State Council, which is located in the west of the Hohhot, with a planning area of 2.2 km2 (0.85 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the export processing zone include Electronics Assembly & Manufacturing, Telecommunications Equipment, Garment and Textiles Production, Trading and Distribution, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Food/Beverage Processing, Instruments & Industrial Equipment Production, Medical Equipment and Supplies, Shipping/Warehousing/Logistics, Heavy Industry.[51]\n\n\n\n* Hohhot Economic and Technological Development Zone\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n* Manzhouli Border Economic Cooperation Area\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nLines wholly or partly in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* Beijing–Baotou railway (Jingbao railway)\n* Baotou–Lanzhou railway\n* Beijing–Tongliao railway\n* Harbin–Manzhouli railway\n* Jiayuguan–Ceke railway\n* Jining–Tongliao railway\n* Linhe–Ceke railway\n* Nenjiang–Greater Khingan Forest railway\n* Tongliao–Ranghulu railway\n\n\nRailway stations in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* List of stations on Jingbao railway\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Inner Mongolia\n\nSee also: List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\nUnder the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, articles 112–122, autonomous regions have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena. Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the Communist Party Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. As of May 2023[update], the current party secretary is Sun Shaocheng. The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased federalism characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.\n\n\nThe position of Chairman of Inner Mongolia alternates between Khorchin Mongols in the east and the Tumed Mongols in the west.[*citation needed*] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, this convention has not been broken. The family of Ulanhu has retained influence in regional politics ever since the founding the People's Republic. His son Buhe and granddaughter Bu Xiaolin both served as Chairman of the region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mongols § Subgroups, Mongols in China, and List of ethnic groups in China\n\n![](image)Muslim-themed Street in Hohhot\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[52] | 6,100,104 | —     |\n| 1964[53] | 12,348,638 | +7.31% |\n| 1982[54] | 19,274,279 | +2.50% |\n| 1990[55] | 21,456,798 | +1.35% |\n| 2000[56] | 23,323,347 | +0.84% |\n| 2010[57] | 24,706,321 | +0.58% |\n| 2020[58] | 24,049,155 | −0.27% |\n| Established in 1947 from dissolution of Xing'an Province, Qahar Province, parts of Rehe Province, and Suiyuan Province; parts of Ningxia Province were incorporated into Inner Mongolia AR. |\n\n\nWhen the autonomous region was established in 1947, Han Chinese comprised 83.6% of the population, while the Mongols comprised 14.8% of the population.[59] By 2020, the percentage of Han Chinese had dropped to 78.7%. While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the Qing dynasty, and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory (Hinggan League, and the prefectures of Tongliao and Chifeng).\n\n\nMongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.7% of the population as of the 2020 census.[60] They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the Buryats and the Oirats are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. In addition to the Manchus, other Tungusic ethnic groups, the Oroqen, and the Evenks also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia. There is also a significant number of Hui and Koreans.\n\n\nMany of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivised during the Mao era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations.\n\n\nInter-marriage between Mongol and non-Mongol populations is very common, particularly in areas where Mongols are in regular contact with other groups. There was little cultural stigma within Mongol families for marrying outside the ethnic group, and in urban centers in particular, Mongol men and women married non-Mongols at relatively similar rates. The rates of intermarriage stands in very sharp contrast to ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs in their respective autonomous regions. By the 1980s, for instance, in the former Jirim League, nearly 40% of marriages with at least one Mongol spouse was a mixed Mongol-Han Chinese marriage.[61] However, anecdotal reports have also demonstrated an increase in Mongol-female, Han Chinese-male pairings in which the woman is of a rural background, ostensibly shutting rural Mongol males from the marriage market as the sex ratio in China becomes more skewed with a much higher proportion of men.[62]\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic groups in Inner Mongolia, 2010 census[63]\n| Ethnicity | Population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Han | 19,650,687 | 79.54%\n |\n| Mongol | 4,226,093 | 17.11%\n |\n| Manchu | 452,765 | 1.83%\n |\n| Daur | 121,483 | 0.49%\n |\n| Evenks | 26,139 | 0.11%\n |\n| Oroqen people | 8,464 | 0.07%\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n | Han Chinese | Mongol | Manchu |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953[64] | 6,100,104\n | 5,119,928\n | 83.9%\n | 888,235\n | 14.6%\n | 18,354\n | 0.3%\n |\n| 1964[64] | 12,348,638\n | 10,743,456\n | 87.0%\n | 1,384,535\n | 11.2%\n | 50,960\n | 0.4%\n |\n| 1982[64] | 19,274,281\n | 16,277,616\n | 84.4%\n | 2,489,378\n | 12.9%\n | 237,149\n | 1.2%\n |\n| 1990[65] | 21,456,500\n | 17,290,000\n | 80.6%\n | 3,379,700\n | 15.8%\n |  |  |\n| 2000[66] | 23,323,347\n | 18,465,586\n | 79.2%\n | 3,995,349\n | 17.1%\n | 499,911\n | 2.3%\n |\n| 2010[67] | 24,706,321\n | 19,650,687\n | 79.5%\n | 4,226,093\n | 17.1%\n | 452,765\n | 1.83%\n |\n| 2020[60] | 24,049,155\n | 18,935,537\n | 78.7%\n | 4,247,815\n | 17.7%\n |  |  |\n\n\n\n\nTerritories with Mongol majorities and near-majorities[*citation needed*]\n| Name of banner | Mongol population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Horqin Right Middle Banner, Hinggan (2020)[68] | 221,258 | 86.6%\n |\n| New Barag Right Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 28,369 | 82.2%\n |\n| Horqin Left Back Banner, Tongliao | 284,000 | 75%\n |\n| New Barag Left Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 31,531 | 74.9%\n |\n| Horqin Left Middle Banner, Tongliao | 395,000 | 73.5%\n |\n| East Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol (2009) | 43,394 | 72.5%\n |\n| West Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol | 57,000 | 65%\n |\n| Sonid Left Banner, Xilingol (2006) | 20,987 | 62.6%\n |\n| Bordered Yellow Banner, Xilingol | 19,000 | 62%\n |\n| Hure Banner, Tongliao | 93,000 | 56%\n |\n| Jarud Banner, Tongliao | 144,000 | 48%\n |\n| Horqin Right Front Banner, Hinggan | 162,000 | 45%\n |\n| Old Barag Banner, Hulunbuir (2006) | 25,903 | 43.6%\n |\n| Jalaid Banner, Hinggan | 158,000 | 39%\n |\n| Ar Khorchin Banner, Chifeng (2002) | 108,000 | 36.6%\n |\n\n\n*Population numbers exclude members of the People's Liberation Army in active service based in Inner Mongolia.*\n\n\n\n## Language and culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Mongolia, Music of Mongolia, Music of Inner Mongolia, and Mongolian language in Inner Mongolia\n\n![](image)A KFC in Hohhot, the capital, with a bilingual street sign in Chinese and Mongolian\n![](image)Inner Mongolian carpet c. 1870\n![](image)Jade dragon of the Hongshan culture (4700 BC – 2900 BC) found in Ongniud Banner, Chifeng\nAlongside Chinese, Mongolian is the official provincial language of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols.[69] Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate)[70] However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in China, specifically in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012.[71] However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanised Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.[72] The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language.[73][74] Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols.[70][75] The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.[76]\n\n\nBy law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in both Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual.\n\n\nMongols in Inner Mongolia speak Mongolian dialects such as Chakhar, Xilingol, Baarin, Khorchin and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects[77] or closely related independent Central Mongolic languages[78] such as Ordos, Khamnigan, Barghu Buryat and the arguably Oirat dialect Alasha. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Inner Mongolian dialects.[79] This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.[80]\n\n\nThe Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. Those in the eastern parts tend to speak Northeastern Mandarin, which belongs to the Mandarin group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the Yellow River valley, speak varieties of Jin, another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the Shanxi province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the Zhangjiakou–Hohhot dialect which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as Hailar.\n\n\nThe vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasises Mongolian nomadic traditions. The Mongols of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of dairy-related products and *hand-held lamb* (手扒肉). In recent years, franchises based on hot pot have appeared in Inner Mongolia, the best known of which is Little Sheep. Notable Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include Mengniu and Yili, both of which began as dairy product and ice cream producers.\n\n\nAmong the Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi opera is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: Shanxi. A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The internationally known Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Inner Mongolia\n\n| Religion in Inner Mongolia (2005–2010) |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Chinese, Han Buddhism and Mongolian folk religion(worship of Heaven and ovoo/aobao) |  | 80% |\n| Tibetan Buddhism |  | 12.0% |\n| Chinese ancestral religion |  | 2.35% |\n| Christianity |  | 2.0% |\n| Islam |  | 1.0% |\n\n![](image)Temple of the White Sulde of Genghis Khan in the town of Uxin in Inner Mongolia, in the Mu Us Desert. The worship of Genghis is shared by Chinese and Mongolian folk religion.[note 4]\nAccording to a survey held in 2004 by the Minzu University of China, about 80% of the population of the region practice the worship of Heaven (that is named *Tian* in the Chinese tradition and *Tenger* in the Mongolian tradition) and of *ovoo/aobao*.[81]\n\n\nOfficial statistics report that 10.9% of the population (3 million people) are members of Tibetan Buddhist groups.[82] According to the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2007 and the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christianity is the religious identity of 3.2% of the population of the region; and Chinese ancestral religion the professed belonging of 2.36%,[83] while a demographic analysis of the year 2010 reported that Muslims comprise the 0.91%.[84]\n\n\nThe cult of Genghis Khan, present in the form of various Genghis Khan temples, is a tradition of Mongolian shamanism, in which he is considered a cultural hero and divine ancestor, an embodiment of the *Tenger* (Heaven, God of Heaven).[85] His worship in special temples, greatly developed in Inner Mongolia since the 1980s, is also shared by the Han Chinese, claiming his spirit as the founding principle of the Yuan dynasty.[86]\n\n\nTibetan Buddhism (Mongolian Buddhism, locally also known as \"Yellow Buddhism\") is the dominant form of Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, also practised by many Han Chinese. Another form of Buddhism, practised by the Chinese, are the schools of Chinese Buddhism.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nIn the capital city Hohhot:\n\n\n\n* Da Zhao Temple is a Buddhist temple built in 1580.

It was founded in 1958, making it the PRC's first launch facility. As of 2021, Jiuquan has documented more launches than any other launch facilities in China, and is still the only launch site for crewed space missions (Shenzhou program). While geologically located inside Inner Mongolia, the launch center is named after Jiuquan, which is the nearest urban center in the nearby province of Gansu. As military facilities, the core areas at Jiuquan Center are highly restricted and can only be visited by tourist buses operated by the center, while the visitor center is open to the public and can be accessed from the south gate.\n\n\nInner Mongolia is also home to the two (and only two) space vehicles landing sites in China, the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in Ulanqab and the Dongfeng Landing Site in Alxa.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and colleges in Inner Mongolia\n\n### Language policy and protest[edit]\n\n\nInner Mongolia under the People's Republic of China has historically allowed the Mongolian language as a medium of instruction. An 1979 article from the *People's Daily* praises the re-establishment of Mongolian-language education after \"interference and vandalism by the Gang of Four\" during the Cultural Revolution.[87]\n\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n\nIt was reported by *The New York Times* on 31 August 2020 that in the summer 2020, the Chinese government announced a new education policy, which called for Chinese to gradually replace Mongolian as the language of instruction in three subjects, including language and literature, politics, and history, in elementary and middle schools around the Inner Mongolia region. Thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protest the policy.[88]\n\n\n\n## Image gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Ulaanbutan grassland](image)\n\nUlaanbutan grassland\n* ![Inner Mongolian grassland](image)\n\nInner Mongolian grassland\n* ![Helan Mountains scenery](image)\n\nHelan Mountains scenery\n* ![Khitan people cooking.

Being the largest province-level division of China by area and the 8th-largest country subdivision in the world, Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million square kilometres (620,000 sq mi) and has about 25 million inhabitants.[1][12] Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. The Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract regions, both administered by China, are claimed by India. Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. The most well-known route of the historic Silk Road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.\n\n\nXinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin (Dzungaria) in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range and only about 9.7 percent of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.[13][*unreliable source?*] It is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Han Chinese, Tibetans, Hui, Chinese Tajiks (Pamiris), Mongols, Russians and Sibe.[14] There are more than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan,[15][16] Chinese Turkistan,[17] East Turkestan[18] and East Turkistan.[19]\n\n\nWith a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a succession of people and empires have vied for control over all or parts of this territory. The territory came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the Republic of China. Since 1949 and the Chinese Civil War, it has been part of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) to strengthen border defense against the Soviet Union and promote the local economy by settling soldiers into the region.[20] In 1955, Xinjiang was administratively changed from a province into an autonomous region. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\n\nFrom the 1990s to the 2010s, the East Turkestan independence movement, separatist conflict and the influence of radical Islam have resulted in unrest in the region with occasional terrorist attacks and clashes between separatist and government forces.[21][22] These conflicts prompted the Chinese government to commit a series of ongoing human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in the province including, according to some, genocide.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Xinjiang |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\"Xīnjiāng\" in Chinese characters\n |\n| Chinese name |\n| Chinese | 新疆 |\n|  |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Xīnjiāng |\n|  |\n| Postal | Sinkiang |\n| Literal meaning | \"New Frontier\" |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Xīnjiāng |\n| Bopomofo | ㄒㄧㄣ   ㄐㄧㄤ |\n| Gwoyeu Romatzyh | Shinjiang |\n| Wade–Giles | Hsin1-chiang1 |\n| Tongyong Pinyin | Sinjiang |\n| Yale Romanization | Syīnjyāng |\n| MPS2 | Shinjihang |\n| IPA | [ɕín.tɕjáŋ] |\n| other Mandarin |\n| Xiao'erjing | ثٍ‌ڭِیَانْ |\n| Dungan | Щинҗён |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | Sîn-kiông |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | Sān'gēung |\n| Jyutping | San1goeng1 |\n| IPA | [sɐn˥.kœːŋ˥] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | Sin-kiong |\n| Teochew Peng'im | Sing-kiang |\n| Eastern Min |\n| Fuzhou BUC | Sĭng-giŏng |\n\n |\n| Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region |\n| Simplified Chinese | 新疆维吾尔自治区 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 新疆維吾爾自治區 |\n|  |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Xīnjiāng Wéiwú'ěr Zìzhìqū |\n|  |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Xīnjiāng Wéiwú'ěr Zìzhìqū |\n| Bopomofo | ㄒㄧㄣ   ㄐㄧㄤㄨㄟˊ   ㄨˊ   ㄦˇㄗˋ   ㄓˋ   ㄑㄩ |\n| Gwoyeu Romatzyh | Shinjiang Weiwueel Tzyhjyhchiu |\n| Wade–Giles | Hsin1-chiang1 Wei2-wu2-êrh3 Tzŭ4-chih4-chʻü1 |\n| Tongyong Pinyin | Sinjiang Wéiwú'ěr Zìhjhìhcyu |\n| Yale Romanization | Syīnjyāng Wéiwúěr Dz̀jr̀chyū |\n| MPS2 | Shinjiang Wheihuel Tzyhgukhickhu |\n| IPA | [ɕín.tɕjáŋ wěɪ.ǔ.àɚ tsɹ̩̂.ʈʂɻ̩̂.tɕʰý] |\n| other Mandarin |\n| Xiao'erjing | ثٍ‌ڭِیَانْ وِوُعَر زِجِ‌کِیُوِ |\n| Dungan | Щинҗён Уйгур Зыҗычү |\n| Wu |\n| Romanization | sin cian vi ng el zy zy chiu |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | Sîn-kiông Vì-ngâ-ngì Tshṳ-tshṳ-khî |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | Sin-kiong Ûi-ngô͘-ní Chū-tī-khu |\n| Teochew Peng'im | Sing-kiang Jûi-û-jéu Tsĕu-tī-khu |\n| Eastern Min |\n| Fuzhou BUC | Sĭng-giŏng Mì-ngù-ī Cê̤ṳ-dê-kṳ̆ |\n\n |\n| Mongolian name |\n| Mongolian Cyrillic | Шиньжян Уйгурын өөртөө засах орон |\n| Mongolian script | ᠰᠢᠨᠵᠢᠶᠠᠩᠤᠶᠢᠭᠤᠷᠤᠨᠥᠪᠡᠷᠲᠡᠭᠡᠨᠵᠠᠰᠠᠬᠤᠣᠷᠤᠨ |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| SASM/GNC | Sinjiyaŋ Uyiɣur-un öbertegen jasaqu orun(Classical)Shin'jyan Uiguryn öörtöö zasakh oron\n (Khalkha) |\n\n |\n| Uyghur name |\n| Uyghur | شىنجاڭ ئۇيغۇر ئاپتونوم رايونى‎ |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Latin Yëziqi | Shinjang Uyghur Aptonom Rayoni |\n| Yengi Yeziⱪ | Xinjang Uyƣur Aptonom Rayoni |\n| SASM/GNC | Xinjang Uyĝur Aptonom Rayoni |\n| Siril Yëziqi | Шинҗаң Уйғур Аптоном Райони |\n\n |\n| Manchu name |\n| Manchu script | ᡳᠴᡝᠵᡝᠴᡝᠨᡠᡳᡤᡠᡵᠪᡝᠶᡝᡩᠠᠰᠠᠩᡤᠠᡤᠣᠯᠣ |\n| Möllendorff | Ice Jecen Uigur beye dasangga golo |\n| Kazakh name |\n| Kazakh | شينجياڭ ۇيعۇر اۆتونوميالىق رايونىШыңжаң Ұйғыр автономиялық ауданы*Shyńjań Uıǵyr aýtonomııalyq aýdany* |\n| Kyrgyz name |\n| Kyrgyz | شئنجاڭ ۇيعۇر اپتونوم رايونۇШинжаң-Уйгур автоном району*Şincañ-Uyğur avtonom rayonu* |\n| Oirat name |\n| Oirat | ᠱᡅᠨᡓᡅᡕᠠᡊᡇᡕᡅᡎᡇᠷᡅᠨᡄᡋᡄᠷᡄᡃᠨᠴᠠᠰᠠᡍᡇᡆᠷᡇᠨŠinǰiyang Uyiγur-in ebereen zasaqu orun |\n| Xibe name |\n| Xibe | ᠰᡞᠨᡪᠶᠠᡢᡠᡞᡤᡠᠷᠪᡝᠶᡝᡩᠠᠰᠠᡢᡤᠠᡤᠣᠯᠣSinjyang Uigur beye dasangga golo |\n| Sarikoli name |\n| Sarikoli | شىنجوڭ ئۈىغۈر ئوفتۇنۇم رايۇن*Xinjong Üighür Oftunum Rayun*[a] |\n|  |\n\n\nThe general region of Xinjiang has been known by many different names in earlier times, in indigenous languages as well as other languages. These names include Altishahr, the historical Uyghur name for the southern half of the region referring to \"the six cities\" of the Tarim Basin, as well as Khotan, Khotay, Chinese Tartary, High Tartary, East Chagatay (it was the eastern part of the Chagatai Khanate), Moghulistan (\"land of the Mongols\"), Kashgaria, Little Bokhara, Serindia (due to Indian cultural influence)[27] and, in Chinese, *Xiyu* (西域), meaning \"Western Regions\".[28]\n\n\nBetween the 2nd century BCE and 2nd century CE the Han Empire established the Protectorate of the Western Regions or Xiyu Protectorate (西域都護府) in an effort to secure the profitable routes of the Silk Road.[29] The Western Regions during the Tang era were known as *Qixi* (磧西). Qi refers to the Gobi Desert while Xi refers to the west. The Tang Empire had established the *Protectorate General to Pacify the West* or *Anxi Protectorate* (安西都護府) in 640 to control the region.\n\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the northern part of Xinjiang, Dzungaria was known as Zhunbu (準部, \"Dzungar region\") and the Southern Tarim Basin was known as *Huijiang* (回疆, \"Muslim Frontier\"). Both regions merged after Qing dynasty suppressed the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas in 1759 and became the region of \"Xiyu Xinjiang\" (西域新疆, literally \"Western Regions' New Frontier\"), later simplified as \"Xinjiang\" (新疆; formerly romanized as \"Sinkiang\"). The official name was given during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor in 1878.[30] According to Chinese statesman Zuo Zongtang's report to the Guangxu Emperor, Xinjiang means an \"old land newly returned\" (故土新歸) or the \"new old land\".[n 2] It can also be translated as \"new frontier\" or \"new territory\".[32] In fact, the term \"Xinjiang\" was used in many other places conquered, but never were ruled by Chinese empires directly until the gradual *Gaitu Guiliu* administrative reform, including regions in Southern China.[33] For instance, present-day Jinchuan County in Sichuan was then known as \"Jinchuan Xinjiang\", Zhaotong in Yunnan was named directly as \"Xinjiang\", Qiandongnan region, Anshun and Zhenning were named as \"Liangyou Xinjiang\" etc.[34]\n\n\nIn 1955, Xinjiang Province was renamed \"Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\". The name that was originally proposed was simply \"Xinjiang Autonomous Region\" because that was the name for the imperial territory. This proposal was not well-received by Uyghurs in the Communist Party, who found the name colonialist in nature since it meant \"new territory\". Saifuddin Azizi, the first chairman of Xinjiang, registered his strong objections to the proposed name with Mao Zedong, arguing that \"autonomy is not given to mountains and rivers. It is given to particular nationalities.\" Some Uyghur Communists proposed the name \"Tian Shan Uyghur Autonomous Region\" instead. The Han Communists in the central government denied the name Xinjiang was colonialist and denied that the central government could be colonialists both because they were communists and because China was a victim of colonialism. However, due to the Uyghur complaints, the administrative region would be named \"Xinjiang *Uygur* Autonomous Region\".[35][32]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dzungaria (red) and the Tarim Basin / Altishahr (blue)\n![](image)Physical map showing the separation of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Altishahr) by the Tien Shan Mountains\nXinjiang consists of two main geographically, historically and ethnically distinct regions with different historical names, Dzungaria north of the Tianshan Mountains and the Tarim Basin south of the Tianshan Mountains, before Qing China unified them into one political entity called Xinjiang Province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic Tibetan Buddhist Dzungar people, while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic-speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the Uyghur people. They were governed separately until 1884. The native Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr.\n\n\nThe Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tian Shan and the Turkic Muslim area south of the Tian Shan and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.[36] However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang.[37] The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing.[38] During the Qing rule, no sense of \"regional identity\" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.[39]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate regions be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.[40]\n\n\nXinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning over 1.6 million km2 (comparable in size to Iran), which takes up about one sixth of the country's territory. Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh district in Ladakh to the south, Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the east, Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii, Govi-Altai and Khovd Provinces) to the east, Russia's Altai Republic to the north and Kazakhstan (Almaty and East Kazakhstan Regions), Kyrgyzstan (Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Osh Regions), Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province and Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan to the west.\n\n\nThe east-west chain of the Tian Shan separate Dzungaria in the north from the Tarim Basin in the south. Dzungaria is a dry steppe and the Tarim Basin contains the massive Taklamakan Desert, surrounded by oases. In the east is the Turpan Depression. In the west, the Tian Shan split, forming the Ili River valley.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Part of a series on the\n |\n| --- |\n| History of Xinjiang |\n| ![](image) |\n| Ancient period\n* Tocharians\n* Yuezhi\n* Xiongnu\n* Western Regions\n\t+ (Han Protectorate; Chief Officials)\n* Kingdom of Khotan\n* Former Liang\n* Former Qin\n* Later Liang\n* Western Liang\n* Gaochang\n* Rouran\n* First Turkic Khaganate\n* Western Turkic Khaganate\n* Eastern Turkic Khaganate\n* Second Turkic Khaganate\n |\n| Medieval and early modern period\n* Tang Protectorates (West; Beiting)\n* Tibetan Empire\n* Uyghur Khaganate\n* Kara-Khanid Khanate\n* Kingdom of Qocho\n* Qara Khitai\n* Mongol Empire (Yuan; Chagatai Khanate)\n* Moghulistan (Turpan; Yarkent)\n* Ming ruled Kara Del\n* Dzungar Khanate\n* Kumul Khanate\n* Yettishar\n* Qing rule\n\t+ (Dzungar genocide\n\t+ Dungan Revolt\n\t+ Qing reconquest)\n |\n| Modern period\n* Xinjiang Province, Republic of China\n\t+ (Xinjiang clique\n\t+ 1st East Turkestan Republic\n\t+ 2nd East Turkestan Republic)\n* Xinjiang Province, People's Republic of China\n* Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n\t+ (Production and Construction Corps\n\t+ Xinjiang conflict\n\t\t- Xinjiang internment camps / Persecution of Uyghurs in China)\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nMain article: History of Xinjiang\n\nFurther information: Western Regions, Kingdom of Khotan, Shule Kingdom, Shanshan, Saka, Tocharians, and Sogdia\n\n![](image)Map of Han Dynasty in 2 CE. Light blue is the Tarim Basin protectorate.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the region encompassing modern day Xinjiang were genetically of Ancient North Eurasian and Northeast Asian origin, with later geneflow from during the Bronze Age linked to the expansion of early Indo-Europeans. These population dynamics gave rise to a heterogeneous demographic makeup. Iron Age samples from Xinjiang show intensified levels of admixture between Steppe pastoralists and northeast Asians, with northern and eastern Xinjiang showing more affinities with northeast Asians, and southern Xinjiang showing more affinity with central Asians.[41][42]\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2015, the remains of 92 individuals in the Xiaohe Cemetery were analyzed for Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA markers. Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the paternal lineages of the Xiaohe people were of European[43] origin, while the maternal lineages of the early population were diverse, featuring both East Eurasian and West Eurasian lineages, as well as a small number of Indian lineages. Over time, the west Eurasian maternal lineages were gradually replaced by east Eurasian maternal lineages. This implies a pattern of outmarriage to women from Siberian communities, which, over many hundreds of years, led to the loss of the original diversity of mtDNA lineages observed in the earlier Xiaohe population.[44][45][46]\n\n\nThe Tarim population was therefore always notably diverse, reflecting a complex history of admixture between people of Ancient North Eurasian, South Asian and Northeast Asian descent. The Tarim mummies have been found in various locations in the Western Tarim Basin such as Loulan, the Xiaohe Tomb complex and Qäwrighul. These mummies have been previously suggested to have been Tocharian or Indo-European speakers, but recent evidence suggest that the earliest mummies belonged to a distinct population unrelated to Indo-European pastoralists and spoke an unknown language, probably a language isolate.[47]\n\n\nAlthough many of the Tarim mummies were classified as Caucasoid by anthropologists, Tarim Basin sites also contain both \"Caucasoid\" and \"Mongoloid\" remains, indicating contact between newly arrived western nomads and agricultural communities in the east.[48] Mummies have been found in various locations in the Western Tarim Basin such as Loulan, the Xiaohe Tomb complex and Qäwrighul.\n\n\nNomadic tribes such as the Yuezhi, Saka and Wusun were probably part of the migration of Indo-European speakers who had settled in Western Central Asia long before the Xiongnu and Han Chinese. By the time the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) wrested the western Tarim Basin away from its previous overlords (the Xiongnu), it was inhabited by various peoples who included the Indo-European-speaking Tocharians in Turfan and Kucha, the Saka peoples centered in the Shule Kingdom and the Kingdom of Khotan, the various Tibeto-Burmese groups (especially people related to the Qiang) as well as the Han Chinese people.[49] Some linguists posit that the Tocharian language had high amounts of influence from Paleosiberian languages,[50] such as Uralic and Yeniseian languages.\n\n\nYuezhi culture is documented in the region. The first known reference to the Yuezhi was in 645 BC by the Chinese chancellor Guan Zhong in his work, *Guanzi* (管子, Guanzi Essays: 73: 78: 80: 81). He described the *Yúshì*, 禺氏 (or *Niúshì*, 牛氏), as a people from the north-west who supplied jade to the Chinese from the nearby mountains (also known as Yushi) in Gansu.[51] The longtime jade supply[52] from the Tarim Basin is well-documented archaeologically: \"It is well known that ancient Chinese rulers had a strong attachment to jade. All of the jade items excavated from the tomb of Fuhao of the Shang dynasty, more than 750 pieces, were from Khotan in modern Xinjiang. As early as the mid-first millennium BC, the Yuezhi engaged in the jade trade, of which the major consumers were the rulers of agricultural China.\"[53]\n\n\nCrossed by the Northern Silk Road,[54] the Tarim and Dzungaria regions were known as the Western Regions. At the beginning of the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) the region was ruled by the Xiongnu, a powerful nomadic people based in present-day Mongolia. During the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty prepared for war against Xiongnu when Emperor Wu of Han dispatched Zhang Qian to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and form an alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu. As a result of the war, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the Ordos and Gansu corridor to Lop Nor. They separated the Xiongnu from the Qiang people on the south and gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states of the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China in which China eventually prevailed. In 60 BC, Han China established the Protectorate of the Western Regions (西域都護府) at Wulei (烏壘, near modern Luntai), to oversee the region as far west as the Pamir Mountains. The protectorate was seized during the civil war against Wang Mang (r. AD 9–23), returning to Han control in 91 due to the efforts of general Ban Chao.\n\n\n\n![Uyghur art from the Bezeklik cavels from 9th Century](image)Old Uyghur/Yugur art from the Bezeklik murals\n![Color-coded physical map of the Tarim Basin](image)The Tarim Basin in the 3rd century AD\nThe Western Jin dynasty succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including Former Liang, Former Qin, Later Liang and Western Liáng, all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success. After the final reunification of Northern China under the Northern Wei empire, its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern region of Xinjiang. Local states such as Shule, Yutian, Guizi and Qiemo controlled the western region, while the central region around Turpan was controlled by Gaochang, remnants of a state (Northern Liang) that once ruled part of what is now Gansu province in northwestern China.\n\n\n\n![Ceramic statue of a small amn riding a large camel](image)A Sogdian man on a Bactrian camel. *Sancai* ceramic statuette, Tang dynasty\nDuring the Tang dynasty, a series of expeditions were conducted against the Western Turkic Khaganate and their vassals: the oasis states of southern Xinjiang.[55] Campaigns against the oasis states began under Emperor Taizong with the annexation of Gaochang in 640.[56] The nearby kingdom of Karasahr was captured by the Tang in 644 and the kingdom of Kucha was conquered in 649.[57] The Tang Dynasty then established the Protectorate General to Pacify the West (安西都護府) or Anxi Protectorate, in 640 to control the region.\n\n\nDuring the Anshi Rebellion, which nearly destroyed the Tang dynasty, Tibet invaded the Tang on a broad front from Xinjiang to Yunnan. It occupied the Tang capital of Chang'an in 763 for 16 days, and controlled southern Xinjiang by the end of the century. The Uyghur Khaganate took control of Northern Xinjiang, much of Central Asia and Mongolia at the same time.\n\n\nAs Tibet and the Uyghur Khaganate declined in the mid-9th century, the Kara-Khanid Khanate (a confederation of Turkic tribes including the Karluks, Chigils and Yaghmas)[58] controlled Western Xinjiang during the 10th and 11th centuries. After the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia was destroyed by the Kirghiz in 840, branches of the Uyghurs established themselves in Qocha (Karakhoja) and Beshbalik (near present-day Turfan and Ürümqi). The Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, although it was ruled by foreign overlords. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in Eastern Xinjiang, initially Manichean, later converted to Buddhism.\n\n\nRemnants of the Liao dynasty from Manchuria entered Xinjiang in 1132, fleeing rebellion by the neighboring Jurchens. They established a new empire, the Qara Khitai, which ruled the Kara-Khanid and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary administrative languages, Persian and Uyghur were also used.[59]\n\n\n\n### Islamization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Part of a series onIslam in China |\n| --- |\n| ![Top of the Great Mosque of Xi'an](image) |\n| History\n| \nBy dynasty |\n| --- |\n| * Tang\n* Song\n* Yuan\n* Ming\n* Qing\n |\n| \nRebellions and revolts |\n| * Jahriyya revolt\n* Panthay Rebellion (1856–1873)\n* First Dungan Revolt (1862–1877)\n* Second Dungan Revolt (1895–1896)\n* Afaqi Khoja revolts\n |\n| \nPost-dynastic China |\n| * 1912–present\n* Second Sino-Japanese War\n* Islamophobia\n |\n |\n| Major figures\n* Afaq Khoja\n* Du Wenxiu\n* Hu Dahai\n* Hu Songshan\n* Kasim Tuet\n* Liu Zhi\n* Ma Anliang\n* Ma Bufang\n* Ma Buqing\n* Ma Fuxiang\n* Ma Gui\n* Ma Hualong\n* Ma Laichi\n* Ma Mingxin\n* Ma Qixi\n* Ma Wanfu\n* Ma Yize\n* Ma Zhu\n* Shams al-Din\n* Su fei-erh\n* Yeheidie'erding\n* Yusuf Ma Dexin\n* Wang Daiyu\n* Zhang Chengzhi\n* Zheng He\n |\n| Culture\n* Architecture\n* Cuisine (Uyghur)\n* Han Kitab\n* Mosques\n* Shrines\n* Sini script\n* Sufi orders\n* Uyghur Arabic\n* Xiao'erjing\n\n* Islamic Association of China\n |\n| * Cities\n* Regions\n* Hong Kong\n* Kashgar\n* Linxia\n* Macau\n* Ningxia\n* Sichuan\n* Xinjiang\n* Xunhua\n |\n| Groups\n* Ahmadis\n* Hui\n* Uyghurs\n* Kazakhs\n* Dongxiangs\n* Kyrgyz\n* Salar\n* Bonans\n* Tajiks\n* Uzbeks\n* Tatars\n* Utsul\n* Tibetans\n* Ili Turks\n |\n| ![](image) Islam portal • ![flag](image) China portal |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nPresent-day Xinjiang consisted of the Tarim Basin and Dzungaria and was originally inhabited by Indo-European Tocharians and Iranian Sakas who practiced Buddhism and Zoroastrianism. The Turfan and Tarim Basins were inhabited by speakers of Tocharian languages,[60] with Caucasian mummies found in the region.[61] The area became Islamified during the 10th century with the conversion of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, who occupied Kashgar. During the mid-10th century, the Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was attacked by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa; the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006.[62]\n\n\n\n### Mongol period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Yarkent Khanate and Turpan Khanate\n\n![Physical map of the Mongol states from the 14th to the 17th centuries](image)Mongol states from the 14th to the 17th centuries: the Northern Yuan dynasty, Four Oirat, Moghulistan and Kara Del\nAfter Genghis Khan unified Mongolia and began his advance west the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi region offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom; Genghis Khan's Mongol Empire conquered the Qara Khitai in 1218. Xinjiang was a stronghold of Ögedei Khan and later came under the control of his descendant, Kaidu. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule ended.\n\n\nDuring the Mongol Empire era the Yuan dynasty vied with the Chagatai Khanate for rule of the region and the latter controlled most of it. After the Chagatai Khanate divided into smaller khanates during the mid-14th century, the politically-fractured region was ruled by a number of Persianized Mongol Khans, including those from Moghulistan (with the assistance of local Dughlat emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan) and Kashgaria. These leaders warred with each other and the Timurids of Transoxiana to the west and the Oirats to the east: the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and China. During the 17th century, the Dzungars established an empire over much of the region.\n\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungars were the collective identity of several Oirat tribes which formed and maintained, one of the last nomadic empires. The Dzungar Khanate covered Dzungaria, extending from the western Great Wall of China to present-day Eastern Kazakhstan and from present-day Northern Kyrgyzstan to Southern Siberia. Most of the region was renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire, which existed from the early 17th to the mid-18th century.[63]\n\n\n\n![Color-coded map, with troop movements](image)The Dzungar–Qing Wars, between the Qing Dynasty and the Dzungar Khanate\nThe sedentary Turkic Muslims of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the Chagatai Khanate and the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongols in Dzungaria ruled the Dzungar Khanate. The Naqshbandi Sufi Khojas, descendants of Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as rulers of the Tarim Basin during the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two Khoja factions: the Afaqi (White Mountain) and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain). The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi and the Afaq Khoja invited the 5th Dalai Lama (the leader of the Tibetans) to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The Dalai Lama then called on his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on the invitation. The Dzungar Khanate conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler. After converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously-Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" (Dzungars) built Buddhist monuments in their region.[64]\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xinjiang under Qing rule\n\n![Artists' depiction of a chaotic battle scene, from a distance](image)The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756, between the Manchu and Oirat armies\n![Color=coded map of 19th-century China](image)The Qing Empire ca. 1820\n![Another battle scene, this one from a greater distance with mountains in the background](image)Scene from the 1828 Qing campaign against rebels in Altishahr\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul oases then submitted to the Qing dynasty and asked China to free them from the Dzungars; the Qing accepted their rulers as vassals. They warred against the Dzungars for decades before defeating them; Qing Manchu Bannermen then conducted the Dzungar genocide, nearly eradicating them and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother, Khoja Jihan, from Dzungar imprisonment and appointed them to rule the Tarim Basin as Qing vassals. The Khoja brothers reneged on the agreement, declaring themselves independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt, and by 1759 China controlled Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin.\n\n\nThe Manchu Qing dynasty gained control of eastern Xinjiang as a result of a long struggle with the Dzungars which began during the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble Amursana, the Qing attacked Ghulja and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate over the next two years, and many Han Chinese and Hui moved into the pacified areas.[65]\n\n\nThe native Dzungar Oirat Mongols suffered greatly from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous smallpox epidemic. Writer Wei Yuan described the resulting desolation in present-day northern Xinjiang as \"an empty plain for several thousand *li*, with no Oirat yurt except those surrendered.\"[66] It has been estimated that 80 percent of the 600,000 (or more) Dzungars died from a combination of disease and warfare,[67] and recovery took generations.[68]\n\n\nHan and Hui merchants were initially only allowed to trade in the Tarim Basin; their settlement in the Tarim Basin was banned until the 1830 Muhammad Yusuf Khoja invasion, when the Qing rewarded merchants for fighting off Khoja by allowing them to settle in the basin.[69] The Uyghur Muslim Sayyid and Naqshbandi Sufi rebel of the Afaqi suborder, Jahangir Khoja was sliced to death (Lingchi) in 1828 by the Manchus for leading a rebellion against the Qing. According to Robert Montgomery Martin, many Chinese with a variety of occupations were settled in Dzungaria in 1870; in Turkestan (the Tarim Basin), however, only a few Chinese merchants and garrison soldiers were interspersed with the Muslim population.[70]\n\n\nThe 1765 Ush rebellion by the Uyghurs against the Manchu began after Uyghur women were raped by the servants and son of Manchu official Su-cheng.[71] It was said that \"Ush Muslims had long wanted to sleep on [Sucheng and son's] hides and eat their flesh\" because of the months-long abuse.[72] The Manchu emperor ordered the massacre of the Uyghur rebel town; Qing forces enslaved the Uyghur children and women, and killed the Uyghur men.[73] Sexual abuse of Uyghur women by Manchu soldiers and officials triggered deep Uyghur hostility against Manchu rule.[74]\n\n\n\n#### Yettishar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yettishar\n\n![](image)Yakub Beg, ruler of Yettishar\nBy the 1860s, Xinjiang had been under Qing rule for a century. The region was captured in 1759 from the Dzungar Khanate,[75] whose population (the Oirats) became the targets of genocide. Xinjiang was primarily semi-arid or desert and unattractive to non-trading Han settlers, and others (including the Uyghurs) settled there.\n\n\nThe Dungan Revolt by the Muslim Hui and other Muslim ethnic groups was fought in China's Shaanxi, Ningxia and Gansu provinces and in Xinjiang from 1862 to 1877. The conflict led to a reported 20.77 million deaths due to migration and war, with many refugees dying of starvation.[76][*failed verification*] Thousands of Muslim refugees from Shaanxi fled to Gansu; some formed battalions in eastern Gansu, intending to reconquer their lands in Shaanxi. While the Hui rebels were preparing to attack Gansu and Shaanxi, Yaqub Beg (an Uzbek or Tajik commander of the Kokand Khanate) fled from the khanate in 1865 after losing Tashkent to the Russians. Beg settled in Kashgar, and soon controlled Xinjiang. Although he encouraged trade, built caravansareis, canals and other irrigation systems, his regime was considered harsh. The Chinese took decisive action against Yettishar; an army under General Zuo Zongtang rapidly approached Kashgaria, reconquering it on 16 May 1877.[77]\n\n\n\n![Photo of three bearded, armed men](image)19th-century Khotan Uyghurs in Yettishar\nAfter reconquering Xinjiang in the late 1870s from Yaqub Beg,[78] the Qing dynasty established Xinjiang (\"new frontier\") as a province in 1884[79] – making it part of China, and dropping the old names of Zhunbu (準部, Dzungar Region) and Huijiang (Muslimland).[80][81]\n\n\nAfter Xinjiang became a Chinese province, the Qing government encouraged the Uyghurs to migrate from southern Xinjiang to other areas of the province (such as the region between Qitai and the capital, largely inhabited by Han Chinese, and Ürümqi, Tacheng (Tabarghatai), Yili, Jinghe, Kur Kara Usu, Ruoqiang, Lop Nor and the lower Tarim River.[82]\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Republic of China; Xinjiang Province, Republic of China; First East Turkestan Republic; and Second East Turkestan Republic\n\n![Soldiers and other sitting on benches in front of a stage](image)Kuomintang in Xinjiang, 1942\nIn 1912, the Qing dynasty was replaced by the Republic of China. Yuan Dahua, the last Qing governor of Xinjiang, fled. One of his subordinates, Yang Zengxin, took control of the province and acceded in name to the Republic of China in March of that year. Balancing mixed ethnic constituencies, Yang controlled Xinjiang until his 1928 assassination after the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang.[83]\n\n\n\n![Sheng Shicai in uniform, looking left](image)Governor Sheng Shicai ruled from 1933 to 1944.\nThe Kumul Rebellion and others broke out throughout Xinjiang during the early 1930s against Jin Shuren, Yang's successor, involving Uyghurs, other Turkic groups and Hui (Muslim) Chinese. Jin enlisted White Russians to crush the revolts. In the Kashgar region on 12 November 1933, the short-lived First East Turkestan Republic was self-proclaimed after debate about whether it should be called \"East Turkestan\" or \"Uyghuristan\".[84][85] The region claimed by the ETR encompassed the Kashgar, Khotan and Aksu Prefectures in southwestern Xinjiang.[86] The Chinese Muslim Kuomintang 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) defeated the army of the First East Turkestan Republic in the 1934 Battle of Kashgar, ending the republic after Chinese Muslims executed its two emirs: Abdullah Bughra and Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra. The Soviet Union invaded the province; it was brought under the control of northeast Han warlord Sheng Shicai after the 1937 Xinjiang War. Sheng ruled Xinjiang for the next decade with support from the Soviet Union, many of whose ethnic and security policies he instituted. The Soviet Union maintained a military base in the province and deployed several military and economic advisors. Sheng invited a group of Chinese Communists to Xinjiang (including Mao Zedong's brother, Mao Zemin), but executed them all in 1943 in fear of a conspiracy. In 1944, President and Premier of China Chiang Kai-shek, informed by the Soviet Union of Shicai's intention to join it, transferred him to Chongqing as the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry the following year.[87] During the Ili Rebellion, the Soviet Union backed Uyghur separatists to form the Second East Turkestan Republic (2nd ETR) in the Ili region while most of Xinjiang remained under Kuomintang control.[84]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China and Migration to Xinjiang\n\n![Color-coded map of China](image)The Soviet-backed Second East Turkestan Republic encompassed Xinjiang's Ili, Tarbagatay and Altay districts.\nThe People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang in 1949, when Kuomintang commander Tao Zhiyue and government chairman Burhan Shahidi surrendered the province to them.[85] Five ETR leaders who were to negotiate with the Chinese about ETR sovereignty died in an air crash that year in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.[88] The PRC continued the system of settler colonialism and forced assimilation which had defined previous Chinese expansionism in Xinjiang.[89]\n\n\nThe PRC autonomous region was established on 1 October 1955, replacing the province;[85] that year (the first modern census in China was taken in 1953), Uyghurs were 73 percent of Xinjiang's total population of 5.11 million.[35] Although Xinjiang was designated a \"Uygur Autonomous Region\" since 1954, more than 50 percent of its area is designated autonomous areas for 13 native non-Uyghur groups.[90] Modern Uyghurs developed ethnogenesis in 1955, when the PRC recognized formerly separately self-identified oasis peoples.[91]\n\n\nSouthern Xinjiang is home to most of the Uyghur population, about nine million people, out of a total population of twenty million; fifty-five percent of Xinjiang's Han population, mainly urban, live in the north.[92][93] This created an economic imbalance, since the northern Junghar basin (Dzungaria) is more developed than the south.[94]\n\n\nLand reform and collectivization occurred in Uyghur agricultural areas at the same general pace as in most of China.[95]: 134 Hunger in Xinjiang was not as great as elsewhere in China during the Great Leap Forward and a million Han Chinese fleeing famine resettled in Xinjiang.[95]: 134\n\n\nIn 1980, China allowed the United States to establish electronic listening stations in Xinjiang so the United States could monitor Soviet rocket launches in central Asia in exchange for the United States authorizing the sale of dual-use civilian and military technology and nonlethal military equipment to China.[96]\n\n\nSince Chinese economic reform since the late 1970s has exacerbated uneven regional development, more Uyghurs have migrated to Xinjiang's cities and some Han have migrated to Xinjiang for economic advancement. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a nine-day visit to Xinjiang in 1981 and described the region as \"unsteady\".[97] The Deng era reforms encouraged China's ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, to establish small private companies for commodity transit, retail, and restaurants.[98] A brisk cross-border shuttle trade by Uyghurs further developed following the Soviet Union's perestroika.[98]\n\n\nIncreased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with Uyghur terrorism since the 1990s, such as the 1997 Ürümqi bus bombings.[99]\n\n\nIn 2000, Uyghurs were 45 percent of Xinjiang's population and 13 percent of Ürümqi's population. With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, Ürümqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Ürümqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in Ürümqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\nXinjiang has 81 public libraries and 23 museums, compared to none in 1949. It has 98 newspapers in 44 languages, compared with four in 1952. According to official statistics, the ratio of doctors, medical workers, clinics and hospital beds to the general population surpasses the national average; the immunization rate has reached 85 percent.[104]\n\n\nThe ongoing Xinjiang conflict[105][106] includes the 2007 Xinjiang raid,[107] a thwarted 2008 suicide-bombing attempt on a China Southern Airlines flight,[108] the 2008 Kashgar attack which killed 16 police officers four days before the Beijing Olympics,[109][110] the August 2009 syringe attacks,[111] the 2011 Hotan attack,[112] the 2014 Kunming attack,[113] the April 2014 Ürümqi attack,[114] and the May 2014 Ürümqi attack.[115] Several of the attacks were orchestrated by the Turkistan Islamic Party (formerly the East Turkestan Islamic Movement), identified as a terrorist group by several entities (including Russia,[116] Turkey,[117][118] the United Kingdom,[119] the United States until October 2020,[120][121] and the United Nations).[122]\n\n\nIn 2014, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership in Xinjiang commenced a People's War against the \"Three Evil Forces\" of separatism, terrorism, and extremism. They deployed two hundred thousand party cadres to Xinjiang and the launched the Civil Servant-Family Pair Up program. Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping was dissatisfied with the initial results of the People's War and replaced Zhang Chunxian with Chen Quanguo as Party Committee Secretary in 2016. Following his appointment Chen oversaw the recruitment of tens of thousands of additional police officers and the division of society into three categories: trusted, average, untrustworthy. He instructed his subordinated to \"Take this crackdown as the top project,\" and \"to preëmpt the enemy, to strike at the outset.\" Following a meeting with Xi in Beijing Chen Quanguo held a rally in Ürümqi with ten thousand troops, helicopters, and armored vehicles. As they paraded he announced a \"smashing, obliterating offensive,\" and declared that they would \"bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the People's War.\"[123]\n\n\nChinese authorities have operated internment camps to indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslims as part of the People's War since at least 2017.[124][23] The camps have been criticized by a number of countries and human-rights organizations for abuse and mistreatment, with some alleging Uyghur genocide.[125] In 2020, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping said: \"Practice has proven that the party's strategy for governing Xinjiang in the new era is completely correct.\"[126]\n\n\nIn 2021, authorities sentenced Sattar Sawut – the former head of Xinjiang's education department and author of a Uyghur-language textbook used in Xinjiang since the mid 2000s – to death with a two-year reprieve. The textbook had been created and approved by relevant government officials, but the Associated Press reported in 2021 that Chinese government said that the \"2003 and 2009 editions of the textbooks contained 84 passages preaching ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism and religious extremism and that several people were inspired by the books to participate in a bloody anti-government riot in the regional capital Urumqi in 2009.\" Shirzat Bawudun, the former head of the Xinjiang department of justice, received the same sentence.[127][128] Three other educators and two textbook editors were given lesser sentences.[129] Chen was replaced as Community Party Secretary for Xinjiang by Ma Xingrui in December 2021.[130]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Xinjiang and List of township-level divisions of Xinjiang.\n\nXinjiang is divided into thirteen prefecture-level divisions: four prefecture-level cities, six prefectures and five autonomous prefectures (including the sub-provincial autonomous prefecture of Ili, which in turn has two of the seven prefectures within its jurisdiction) for Mongol, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Hui minorities.[131]\n\n\nThese are then divided into 13 districts, 26 county-level cities, 62 counties and 6 autonomous counties. Ten of the county-level cities do not belong to any prefecture and are *de facto* administered by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).

Highway in Xinjiang.\nXinjiang is the largest political subdivision of China, accounting for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases conducive to habitation accounting for 9.7 percent of Xinjiang's total area by 2015[13] at the foot of Tian Shan, Kunlun Mountains and Altai Mountains, respectively.\n\n\n\n### Mountain systems and basins[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(July 2019)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nXinjiang is split by the Tian Shan mountain range (تەڭرى تاغ‎, Tengri Tagh, Тәңри Тағ), which divides it into two large basins: the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the Borohoro Mountains in the north, is the basin of the Ili River, which flows into Kazakhstan's Lake Balkhash; an even smaller wedge farther north is the Emin Valley.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pamir Mountains and Muztagh Ata.\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the Pamir Mountains and Karakoram in the southwest, the Kunlun Mountains in the south (along the border with Tibet) and the Altai Mountains in the northeast (shared with Mongolia). The region's highest point is the mountain K2, an eight-thousander located 8,611 metres (28,251 ft) above sea level in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Taklamakan Desert\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the Taklamakan Desert. North of it is the Turpan Depression, which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres (509 ft) below sea level.\n\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large Gurbantünggüt Desert (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\n\nThe Tian Shan mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the Torugart Pass (3752 m). The Karakorum highway (KKH) links Islamabad, Pakistan with Kashgar over the Khunjerab Pass.\n\n\n\n### Mountain passes[edit]\n\n\nFrom south to north, the mountain passes bordering Xinjiang are:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mountain passes bordering Xinjiang\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| 山口\n | Mountain Pass\n | Coordinate\n | Elev.\n | Appendix\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 喀喇昆仑山口 | Karakoram Pass | 35°30′48″N 77°49′23″E﻿ / ﻿35.513333°N 77.823056°E﻿ / 35.513333;

Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the Tian Shan, Kunlun Shan, and Pamir mountain ranges; said tectonics render it a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where Kazakhstania is geologically part of Kazakhstan, and in the east, where is part of the North China Craton.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Center of the continent[edit]\n\n\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the Gurbantünggüt Desert, the location in Eurasia that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a continental pole of inaccessibility): 46°16.8′N 86°40.2′E﻿ / ﻿46.2800°N 86.6700°E﻿ / 46.2800; 86.6700﻿ (Eurasian pole of inaccessibility). It is at least 2,647 km (1,645 mi) (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang – 43°40′52″N 87°19′52″E﻿ / ﻿43.68111°N 87.33111°E﻿ / 43.68111; 87.33111 in the southwestern suburbs of Ürümqi, Ürümqi County – to be the \"center point of Asia\". A monument to this effect was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.[138]\n\n\n\n### Rivers and lakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tianchi Lake\n![](image)Black Irtysh river in Burqin County is a famous spot for sightseeing.\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is endorheic. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the Irtysh River rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the Arctic Ocean, is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the Irtysh–Karamay–Ürümqi Canal to the drier regions of southern Dzungarian Basin.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kanas Lake\nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the Tarim Basin, the Tarim, which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the Lop Lake. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into Lake Manas. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of potassium fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.\n\n\n\n### Time[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Xinjiang Time and Time in China § Xinjiang\n\nDespite the province's easternmost point being more than 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) west of Beijing, Xinjiang, like the rest of China, is officially in the UTC+8 time zone, known by residents as Beijing Time. Despite this, some residents, local organizations and governments observe UTC+6 as the standard time and refer to this zone as Xinjiang Time.[139] Han people tend to use Beijing Time, while Uyghurs tend to use Xinjiang Time as a form of resistance to Beijing.[140] Time zones notwithstanding, most schools and businesses open and close two hours later than in the other regions of China.[141]\n\n\n\n### Deserts[edit]\n\n\nDeserts include:\n\n\n\n* Gurbantünggüt Desert, also known as *Dzoosotoyn Elisen*\n* Taklamakan Desert\n* Kumtag Desert, east of Taklamakan\n\n\n### Major cities[edit]\n\n\nDue to water scarcity, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges in areas conducive to irrigated agriculture. It is in these belts where most of the region's cities are found.\n\n\n\n![](image)Largest cities and towns of Xinjiang\n* Ürümqi\n* Turpan\n* Kashgar\n* Karamay\n* Ghulja\n* Shihezi\n* Hotan\n* Atush\n* Aksu\n* Korla\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nA semiarid or desert climate (Köppen *BSk* or *BWk*, respectively) prevails in Xinjiang. The entire region has great seasonal differences in temperature with cold winters. The Turpan Depression often records some of the hottest temperatures nationwide in summer,[142] with air temperatures easily exceeding 40 °C (104 °F). Winter temperatures regularly fall below −20 °C (−4 °F) in the far north and highest mountain elevations.\n\n\nContinuous permafrost is typically found in the Tian Shan starting at the elevation of about 3,500–3,700 m above sea level. Discontinuous alpine permafrost usually occurs down to 2,700–3,300 m, but in certain locations, due to the peculiarity of the aspect and the microclimate, it can be found at elevations as low as 2,000 m.[143]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of current Chinese provincial leaders\n\n![](image)Statue of Mao Zedong in Kashgar\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCurrent leaders of the Xinjiang Regional Government\n|  | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title\n | **CCP Committee Secretary** | **People's Congress Chairwoman** | **Chairman** | **Xinjiang CPPCC Chairman** |\n| Name\n | Ma Xingrui | Zumret Obul | Erkin Tuniyaz | Nurlan Abilmazhinuly |\n| Born\n | October 1959 (age 64)\n | August 1959 (age 64)\n | November 1961 (age 62)\n | December 1962 (age 61)\n |\n| Assumed office\n | December 2021\n | January 2023\n | September 2021\n | January 2023\n |\n\n\nSecretaries of the Chinese Communist Party Xinjiang Regional Committee\n1. 1949–1952: Wang Zhen (王震)\n2. 1952–1967: Wang Enmao (王恩茂)\n3. 1970–1972: Long Shujin (龙书金)\n4. 1972–1978: Saifuddin Azizi (赛福鼎·艾则孜; سەيپىدىن ئەزىزى)\n5. 1978–1981: Wang Feng (汪锋)\n6. 1981–1985: Wang Enmao (王恩茂)\n7. 1985–1994: Song Hanliang (宋汉良)\n8. 1994–2010: Wang Lequan (王乐泉)\n9. 2010–2016: Zhang Chunxian (张春贤)\n10. 2016–2021: Chen Quanguo (陈全国)\n11.

It plays a critical role in the region's economy, owning or being otherwise connected to many companies in the region as well as dominating Xinjiang's agricultural output.[144] It additionally directly administers cities throughout Xinjiang, mainly concentrated in the northern parts. It is headed by the CCP secretary of Xinjiang, while the CCP secretary of the XPCC is considered the second most powerful person in the region.[144]\n\n\n\n### Human rights abuses[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in China, Xinjiang internment camps, and Uyghur genocide\n\nSee also: Law of the People's Republic of China\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented *the denial of due legal process and fair trials and failure to hold genuinely open trials as mandated by law* e.g. to suspects arrested following ethnic violence in the city of Ürümqi's 2009 riots.[145]\n\n\nThe Chinese government under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping's administration[23] launched the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there;[146] the program was massively expanded by Chen Quanguo when he was appointed as CCP Xinjiang secretary in 2016.[147] The campaign included the detainment of 1.8 million people in internment camps, mostly Uyghurs but also including other ethnic and religious minorities, by 2020.[147] An October 2018 exposé by BBC News claimed based on analysis of satellite imagery collected over time that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs were likely interned in the camps, and they are rapidly being expanded.[148] In 2019, *The Art Newspaper* reported that \"hundreds\" of writers, artists, and academics had been imprisoned, in what the magazine qualified as an attempt to \"punish any form of religious or cultural expression\" among Uyghurs.[149] This program has been called a genocide by some observers, while a report by the UN Human Rights Office said they may amount to crimes against humanity.[150][151]\n\n\nOn 28 June 2020, the Associated Press published a report which stated the Chinese government was taking draconian measures to slash birth rates among Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, even as it encouraged some of the country's Han majority to have more children.[152] While individual women have spoken out before about forced birth control, the practice was far more widespread and systematic than previously known, according to an AP investigation based on government statistics, state documents and interviews with 30 ex-detainees, family members and a former detention camp instructor. The campaign over the past four years in Xinjiang has been labeled by some experts as a form of \"demographic genocide.\"[152]\n\n\n\n### East Turkestan independence movement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Xinjiang conflict and East Turkestan independence movement\n\n![](image)This flag (Kök Bayraq) has become a symbol of the East Turkestan independence movement.\nSome factions in Xinjiang, most prominently Uyghur nationalists, advocate establishing an independent country named East Turkestan (also sometimes called \"Uyghuristan\"),[153] which has led to tension, conflict,[154] and ethnic strife in the region.[155][156][157] Autonomous regions in China do not have a legal right to secede, and each one is considered to be an \"inseparable part of the People's Republic of China\" by the government.[158][159] The separatist movement claims that the region is not part of China, but was invaded by the CCP in 1949 and has been under occupation since then. The Chinese government asserts that the region has been part of China since ancient times,[160] and has engaged in \"strike hard\" campaigns targeted at separatists.[161] The movement has been supported by both militant Islamic extremist groups such as the Turkistan Islamic Party,[162] as well as certain advocacy groups with no connection to extremist groups.\n\n\nAccording to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for separatism in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n![](image)The distribution map of Xinjiang's GDP per person (2011)\n![](image)Ürümqi is a major industrial center within Xinjiang.\n![](image)Wind farm in Xinjiang\n![](image)Sunday market in Khotan\nThe GDP of Xinjiang was about CN¥1.774 trillion (US$263 billion) as of 2022[update].[6] Economic growth has been fueled by to discovery of the abundant reserves of coal, oil, gas as well as the China Western Development policy introduced by the State Council to boost economic development in Western China.[164] Its per capita GDP for 2022 was CN¥68,552 (US$10,191). Southern Xinjiang, with 95 percent non-Han population, has an average per capita income half that of Xinjiang as a whole.[6] XPCC plays an outsized role in Xinjiang's economy, with the organization producing CN¥350 billion (US$52 billion), or around 19.7% of Xinjiang's economy, while the per capita GDP was CN¥98,748 (US$14,680).[165]\n\n\nEconomic development of Xinjiang is a priority for China.[166] In 2000, the government articulated its strategy for developing the western regions of the country, and that plan made Xinjiang a major focus.[166] Accelerating development in Xinjiang is intended by China to achieve a number of objectives, including narrowing the economic gap between Xinjiang and the more developed eastern provinces, as well as alleviating political discontent and security problems by alleviating poverty and raising the standard of living in order to increase stability.[166]\n\n\nIn July 2010, state media outlet *China Daily* reported that:\n\n\n\n\n> Local governments in China's 19 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Liaoning, are engaged in the commitment of \"pairing assistance\" support projects in Xinjiang to promote the development of agriculture, industry, technology, education and health services in the region.[167]\n> \n> \n\n\nXinjiang has traditionally been an agricultural region, but is also rich in minerals and oil. Xinjiang is a major producer of solar panel components due to its large production of the base material polysilicon. In 2020 45 percent of global production of solar-grade polysilicon occurred in Xinjiang. Concerns have been raised both within the solar industry and outside it that forced labor may occur in the Xinjiang part of the supply chain.[168] The global solar panel industry are under pressure to move sourcing away from the region due to human rights and liability concerns.[169] China's solar association claimed the allegations were baseless and unfairly stigmatized firms with operations there.[170] A 2021 investigation in the United Kingdom found that 40 percent of solar farms in the UK had been built using panels from Chinese companies linked to forced labor in Xinjiang.[171]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and fishing[edit]\n\n\nMain area is of irrigated agriculture. By 2015, the agricultural land area of the region is 631 thousand km2 or 63.1 million ha, of which 6.1 million ha is arable land.[172] In 2016, the total cultivated land rose to 6.2 million ha, with the crop production reaching 15.1 million tons.[173] Agriculture in Xinjiang is dominated by the XPCC, which employs a majority of the organization's workforce.[174] Wheat was the main staple crop of the region, maize grown as well, millet found in the south, while only a few areas (in particular, Aksu) grew rice.[175]\n\n\nCotton became an important crop in several oases, notably Hotan, Yarkand and Turpan by the late 19th century.[175] Sericulture is also practiced.[176] The Xinjiang cotton industry is the world's largest cotton exporter, producing 84 percent of Chinese cotton while the country provides 26 percent of global cotton export.[177] Xinjiang also produces peppers and pepper pigments used in cosmetics such lipstick for export.[178]\n\n\nXinjiang is famous for its grapes, melons, pears, walnuts, particularly Hami melons and Turpan raisins.[*citation needed*] The region is also a leading source for tomato paste, which it supplies for international brands.[177]\n\n\nThe main livestock of the region have traditionally been sheep. Much of the region's pasture land is in its northern part, where more precipitation is available,[179] but there are mountain pastures throughout the region.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDue to the lack of access to the ocean and limited amount of inland water, Xinjiang's fish resources are somewhat limited. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of fishing in Lake Ulungur and Lake Bosten and in the Irtysh River. A large number of fish ponds have been constructed since the 1970s, their total surface exceeding 10,000 hectares by the 1990s. In 2000, the total of 58,835 tons of fish was produced in Xinjiang, 85 percent of which came from aquaculture.[180] The Sayram Lake is both the largest alpine lake and highest altitude lake in Xinjiang, and is the location of a major cold-water fishery.[*citation needed*] Originally Sayram had no fish but in 1998, northern whitefish (Coregonus peled) from Russia were introduced and investment in breeding infrastructure and technology has consequently made Sayram into the country's largest exporter of northern whitefish with an annual output of over 400 metric tons.[181][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mining and minerals[edit]\n\n\nXinjiang was known for producing salt, soda, borax, gold, and jade in the 19th century.[182]\n\n\nThe Lop Lake was once a large brackish lake during the end of the Pleistocene but has slowly dried up in the Holocene where average annual precipitation in the area has declined to just 31.2 millimeters (1.2 inches), and experiences annual evaporation rate of 2,901 millimeters (114 inches). The area is rich in brine Potash, a key ingredient in fertilizer and is the second-largest source of potash in the country. Discovery of potash in the mid-1990s, has transformed Lop Nur into a major Potash mining industry.[183]\n\n\nThe oil and gas extraction industry in Aksu and Karamay is growing, with the West–East Gas Pipeline linking to Shanghai. The oil and petrochemical sector get up to 60 percent of Xinjiang's economy.[184] The region contains over a fifth of China's hydrocarbon resources and has the highest concentration of fossil fuel reserves of any region in the country.[185] The region is rich in coal and contains 40 percent of the country's coal reserves or around 2.2 trillion tonnes, which is enough to supply China's thermal coal demand for more than 100 years even if only 15 percent of the estimated coal reserve prove recoverable.[186][187]\n\n\nTarim basin is the largest oil and gas bearing area in the country with about 16 billion tonnes of oil and gas reserves discovered.[188] The area is still actively explored and in 2021, China National Petroleum Corporation found a new oil field reserve of 1 billion tons (about 907 million tonnes). That find is regarded as being the largest one in recent decades. As of 2021, the basin produces hydrocarbons at an annual rate of 2 million tons, up from 1.52 million tons from 2020.[189]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Dabei gas field and Dina-2 gas field\n\n### Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\nTrade with Central Asian countries is crucial to Xinjiang's economy.[190] Most of the overall import/export volume in Xinjiang was directed to and from Kazakhstan through Ala Pass. China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market. Xinjiang also opened its second border trade market to Kazakhstan in March 2006, the Jeminay Border Trade Zone.[192]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Bole Border Economic Cooperation Area[193]\n* Shihezi Border Economic Cooperation Area[194]\n* Tacheng Border Economic Cooperation Area[195]\n\n\n![](image)Ürümqi Diwopu International Airport\n* Ürümqi Economic & Technological Development Zone is northwest of Ürümqi.

Xinjiang Muslim Turkic peoples contain Uyghurs, Kazaks, Kyrgyz, Tatars, Uzbeks; Muslim Iranian peoples comprise Tajiks, Sarikolis/Wakhis (often conflated as Tajiks); Muslim Sino-Tibetan peoples are such as the Hui. Other ethnic groups in the region are Hans, Mongols (Oirats, Daurs, Dongxiangs), Russians, Xibes, Manchus. Around 70,000 Russian immigrants were living in Xinjiang in 1945.[220]\n\n\nThe Han Chinese of Xinjiang arrived at different times from different directions and social backgrounds. There are now descendants of criminals and officials who had been exiled from China during the second half of the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries; descendants of families of military and civil officers from Hunan, Yunnan, Gansu and Manchuria; descendants of merchants from Shanxi, Tianjin, Hubei and Hunan; and descendants of peasants who started immigrating into the region in 1776.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)The languages of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n![](image)Uyghur girl in Kashgar\n![](image)County-level ethnicity map of Xinjiang as of 2018\nSome Uyghur scholars claim descent from both the Turkic Uyghurs and the pre-Turkic Tocharians (or Tokharians, whose language was Indo-European); also, Uyghurs often have relatively-fair skin, hair and eyes and other Caucasoid physical traits.\n\n\nIn 2002, there were 9,632,600 males (growth rate of 1.0 percent) and 9,419,300 females (growth rate of 2.2 percent). The population overall growth rate was 1.09 percent, with 1.63 percent of birth rate and 0.54 percent mortality rate.\n\n\n\n![](image)Three Uyghur girls at a Sunday market in the oasis city Khotan.\nThe Qing began a process of settling Han, Hui, and Uyghur settlers into Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) in the 18th century. At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in Southern Xinjiang.[222] A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30 percent Han and 60 percent Turkic and it dramatically shifted to 6 percent Han and 75 percent Uyghur in the 1953 census. However, a situation similar to the Qing era's demographics with a large number of Han had been restored by 2000, with 40.57 percent Han and 45.21 percent Uyghur.[223] Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang.[224] Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in Southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin), and only a few Uyghurs lived in Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria).[225]\n\n\nAfter 1831, the Qing encouraged Han Chinese migration into the Tarim Basin, in southern Xinjiang, but with very little success, and permanent troops were stationed on the land there as well.[226] Political killings and expulsions of non-Uyghur populations during the uprisings in the 1860s[226] and the 1930s saw them experience a sharp decline as a percentage of the total population[227] though they rose once again in the periods of stability from 1880, which saw Xinjiang increase its population from 1.2 million,[228][229] to 1949. From a low of 7 percent in 1953, the Han began to return to Xinjiang between then and 1964, where they comprised 33 percent of the population (54 percent Uyghur), like in Qing times. A decade later, at the beginning of the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the demographic balance was 46 percent Uyghur and 40 percent Han,[223] which did not change drastically until the 2000 Census, when the Uyghur population had reduced to 42 percent.[230] In 2010, the population of Xinjiang was 45.84 percent Uyghur and 40.48 percent Han. The 2020 Census showed the share of the Uyghur population decline slightly to 44.96 percent, and the Han population rise to 42.24 percent[231][232]\n\n\nMilitary personnel are not counted and national minorities are undercounted in the Chinese census, as in some other censuses.[233] 3.6 million people reside in XPCC administered areas, around 14 percent of Xinjiang's population.[165] While some of the shift has been attributed to an increased Han presence,[14] Uyghurs have also emigrated to other parts of China, where their numbers have increased steadily. Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in Northern Xinjiang Dzungaria and are separated from areas of historic Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (Southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90 percent of the population.[234]\n\n\nIn general, Uyghurs are the majority in Southwestern Xinjiang, including the prefectures of Kashgar, Khotan, Kizilsu and Aksu (about 80 percent of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in those four prefectures) as well as Turpan Prefecture, in Eastern Xinjiang. The Han are the majority in Eastern and Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria), including the cities of Ürümqi, Karamay, Shihezi and the prefectures of Changjyi, Bortala, Bayin'gholin, Ili (especially the cities of Kuitun) and Kumul. Kazakhs are mostly concentrated in Ili Prefecture in Northern Xinjiang. Kazakhs are the majority in the northernmost part of Xinjiang.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic groups in Xinjiang\n |\n| --- |\n| 2020 Chinese census[235] |\n| Nationality | Population | Percentage\n |\n| Uyghur | 11,624,257 | 44.96 percent\n |\n| Han | 10,920,098 | 42.24 percent\n |\n| Kazakh | 1,539,636 | 5.96 percent\n |\n| Hui | 1,102,928 | 4.27 percent\n |\n| Kirghiz | 199,264 | 0.77 percent\n |\n| Mongols | 169,143 | 0.65 percent\n |\n| Dongxiang | 72,036 | 0.28 percent\n |\n| Tajiks | 50,238 | 0.19 percent\n |\n| Xibe | 34,105 | 0.13 percent\n |\n| Manchu | 20,915 | 0.080 percent\n |\n| Tujia | 15,787 | 0.086 percent\n |\n| Tibetan | 18,276 | 0.071 percent\n |\n| Uzbek | 12,301 | 0.048 percent\n |\n| Miao | 12,220 | 0.047 percent\n |\n| Russian | 8,024 | 0.031 percent\n |\n| Yi | 7,752 | 0.030 percent\n |\n| Zhuang | 5,727 | 0.022 percent\n |\n| Daur | 5,447 | 0.021 percent\n |\n| Tatar | 5,183 | 0.024 percent\n |\n| Tu | 3,827 | 0.015 percent\n |\n| Salar | 3,266 | 0.013 percent\n |\n| Other | 11,764 | 0.046 percent\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Major ethnic groups in Xinjiang by region (2018 data)[I]P = Prefecture; AP = Autonomous prefecture; PLC = Prefecture-level city; DACLC = Directly administered county-level city.[236] |\n| --- |\n|  | Uyghurs (%) | Han (%) | Kazakhs (%) | others (%) |\n| **Xinjiang** | **51.14** | **34.41** | **6.90** | **7.55** |\n| Ürümqi PLC | 12.85 | **71.21** | 2.77 | 13.16\n |\n| Karamay PLC | 15.59 | **74.67** | 4.05 | 5.69\n |\n| Turpan Prefecture | **76.96** | 16.84 | 0.05 | 6.15\n |\n| Kumul Prefecture | 20.01 | **65.49** | 10.04 | 4.46\n |\n| Changji AP | 4.89 | **72.28** | 10.34 | 12.49\n |\n| Bortala AP | 14.76 | **63.27** | 10.41 | 11.56\n |\n| Bayin'gholin AP | 36.38 | **53.31** | 0.11 | 10.20\n |\n| Aksu Prefecture | **80.08** | 18.56 | 0.01 | 1.36\n |\n| Kizilsu AP | **66.24** | 6.29 | 0.03 | 27.44\n |\n| Kashgar Prefecture | **92.56** | 6.01 | < 0.005 | 1.42\n |\n| Khotan Prefecture | **96.96** | 2.85 | < 0.005 | 0.19\n |\n| Ili AP[n 3] | 17.95 | 40.09 | 27.16 | 14.80\n |\n| – *former Ili Prefecture* | 26.30 | 35.21 | 21.57 | 16.91\n |\n| – *Tacheng Prefecture* | 4.25 | **54.66** | 26.66 | 14.43\n |\n| – *Altay Prefecture* | 1.42 | 39.85 | **52.76** | 5.97\n |\n| Shihezi DACLC | 1.09 | **94.13** | 0.63 | 4.15\n |\n| Aral DACLC | 3.66 | **91.96** | < 0.005 | 4.38\n |\n| Tumushuke DACLC | **67.49** | 31.73 | < 0.005 | 0.78\n |\n| Wujiaqu DACLC | 0.05 | **96.29** | 0.10 | 3.55\n |\n| Tiemenguan DACLC | 0.07 | **95.96** | 0.00 | 3.97\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n### Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year[237] | Population\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural change\n | Crude birth rate(per 1000)\n | Crude death rate(per 1000)\n | Natural change(per 1000)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011\n | 22,090,000\n |  |  |  | 14.99 | 4.42 | 10.57\n |\n| 2012\n | 22,330,000\n |  |  |  | 15.32 | 4.48 | 10.84\n |\n| 2013\n | 22,640,000\n |  |  |  | 15.84 | 4.92 | 10.92\n |\n| 2014\n | 22,980,000\n |  |  |  | 16.44 | 4.97 | 11.47\n |\n| 2015\n | 23,600,000\n |  |  |  | 15.59 | 4.51 | 11.08\n |\n| 2016\n | 23,980,000\n |  |  |  | 15.34 | 4.26 | 11.08\n |\n| 2017\n | 24,450,000\n |  |  |  | 15.88 | 4.48 | 11.40\n |\n| 2018\n | 24,870,000\n |  |  |  | 10.69 | 4.56 | 6.13\n |\n| 2019\n | 25,230,000\n |  |  |  | 8.14 | 4.45 | 3.69\n |\n| 2020\n | 25,852,000\n |  |  |  | 7.01 |  |  |\n| 2021\n | 25,890,000\n |  |  |  | 6.16 | 5.60 | 0.56[238] |\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Islam in China and Antireligious campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party\nReligion in Xinjiang (around 2010)\n\n\n\nIslam (58%)\nBuddhism (32%)\nTaoism (9%)\nChristianity (1%)\n\nThe major religions in Xinjiang are Islam, practiced largely by Uyghurs and the Hui Chinese minority, as well as Chinese folk religions, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, practiced essentially by the Han Chinese. According to a demographic analysis of the year 2010, Muslims formed 58 percent of the province's population.[239] In 1950, there were 29,000 mosques and 54,000 imams in Xinjiang, which fell to 14,000 mosques and 29,000 imams by 1966. Following the Cultural Revolution, there were only about 1,400 remaining mosques. By the mid-1980's, the number of mosques had returned to 1950 levels.[240] According to a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, since 2017, Chinese authorities have destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang – 65 percent of the region's total.[241][242] Christianity in Xinjiang is the religion of 1 percent of the population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009.[243]\n\n\nA majority of the Uyghur Muslims adhere to Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence or madhab.[*citation needed*] A minority of Shias, almost exclusively of the Nizari Ismaili (Seveners) rites are located in the higher mountains of Tajik and Tian Shan. In the western mountains (the Tajiks), almost the entire population of Tajiks (Sarikolis and Wakhis), are Nizari Ismaili Shia.[14] In the north, in the Tian Shan, the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz are Sunni.\n\n\nAfaq Khoja Mausoleum and Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar are most important Islamic Xinjiang sites. Emin Minaret in Turfan is a key Islamic site. Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves is a notable Buddhist site.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nXinjiang is home to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers professional basketball team of the Chinese Basketball Association, and to Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard F.C., a football team that plays in China League One.\n\n\nThe capital, Ürümqi, is home to the Xinjiang University baseball team, an integrated Uyghur and Han group profiled in the documentary film *Diamond in the Dunes*.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Karakorum highway\nIn 2008, according to the Xinjiang Transportation Network Plan, the government has focused construction on State Road 314, Alar-Hotan Desert Highway, State Road 218, Qingshui River Line-Yining Highway and State Road 217, as well as other roads.\n\n\nThe construction of the first expressway in the mountainous area of Xinjiang began a new stage in its construction on 24 July 2007. The 56 km (35 mi) highway linking Sayram Lake and Guozi Valley in Northern Xinjiang area had cost 2.39 billion yuan. The expressway is designed to improve the speed of national highway 312 in northern Xinjiang. The project started in August 2006 and several stages have been fully operational since March 2007. Over 3,000 construction workers have been involved. The 700 m-long Guozi Valley Cable Bridge over the expressway is now currently being constructed, with the 24 main pile foundations already completed. Highway 312 national highway Xinjiang section, connects Xinjiang with China's east coast, Central and West Asia, plus some parts of Europe. It is a key factor in Xinjiang's economic development. The population it covers is around 40 percent of the overall in Xinjiang, who contribute half of the GDP in the area.\n\n\nZulfiya Abdiqadir, head of the Transport Department was quoted as saying that 24,800,000,000 RMB had been invested into Xinjiang's road network in 2010 alone and, by this time, the roads covered approximately 152,000 km (94,000 mi).[244]\n\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

To the east, a conventional and a high-speed rail line runs through Turpan and Hami to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. A third outlet to the east connects Hami and Inner Mongolia.\n\n\nTo the west, the Northern Xinjiang runs along the northern footslopes of the Tian Shan range through Changji, Shihezi, Kuytun and Jinghe to the Kazakh border at Alashankou, where it links up with the Turkestan–Siberia Railway. Together, the Northern Xinjiang and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang lines form part of the Trans-Eurasian Continental Railway, which extends from Rotterdam, on the North Sea, to Lianyungang, on the East China Sea. The Northern Xinjiang railway provides additional rail transport capacity to Jinghe, from which the Jinghe–Yining–Khorgos railway heads into the Ili River Valley to Yining, Huocheng and Khorgos, a second rail border crossing with Kazakhstan. The Kuytun–Beitun railway runs from Kuytun north into the Junggar Basin to Karamay and Beitun, near Altay.\n\n\nIn the south, the Southern Xinjiang railway from Turpan runs southwest along the southern footslopes of the Tian Shan into the Tarim Basin, with stops at Yanqi, Korla, Kuqa, Aksu, Maralbexi (Bachu), Artux and Kashgar. From Kashgar, the Kashgar–Hotan railway, follows the southern rim of the Tarim to Hotan, with stops at Shule, Akto, Yengisar, Shache (Yarkant), Yecheng (Karghilik), Moyu (Karakax).\n\n\nThe Ürümqi–Dzungaria railway connects Ürümqi with coal fields in the eastern Junggar Basin. The Hami–Lop Nur railway connects Hami with potassium salt mines in and around Lop Nur. The Golmud–Korla railway, opened in 2020, provides an outlet to Qinghai. Planning is underway on additional intercity railways.[245] Railways to Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have been proposed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n* Administrative divisions of China\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There is no official orthography for Sarikoli in China.

Private investment and exports are the main drivers of economic growth in China; but the Chinese government has also emphasized domestic consumption.[36]\n\n\nChina is the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods.[37] It is also the world's fastest-growing consumer market and second-largest importer of goods.[38] China is also the world's largest consumer of numerous commodities, and accounts for about half of global consumption of metals.[39] China is a net importer of services products.[40] It is the largest trading nation in the world and plays a prominent role in international trade.[41][42] China is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world as of 2020, receiving inflows of $163 billion.[43] It has the second largest outward foreign direct investment, at US$136.91 billion for 2019 alone, following Japan at US$226.65 billion for the same period.[44] As of 2022, China was second in the world in total number of billionaires.[45] In 2018, it was second in millionaires with 3.5 million.[46] According to the 2019 Global Wealth Report by Credit Suisse Group, China surpassed the US in the wealth of the top ten percent of the world's population.[47][note 5] China has the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $3.1 trillion,[48] but if the foreign assets of China's state-owned commercial banks are included, the value of China's reserves rises to nearly $4 trillion.[49] China faced a mild economic slowdown during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and initiated a massive stimulus package, which helped to regain its economic growth.\n\n\nWith 778 million workers, the Chinese labor force was the world's largest as of 2020. It ranks 28th on the Global Competitiveness Report.[50] Per the Global Innovation Index in 2022, China was ranked 11th in the world, 3rd in Asia & Oceania region and 2nd for countries with a population of over 100 million. It is the only middle-income economy and the only newly industrialized economy in the top 30.[51][52] It is often ranked among the world's most innovative countries, leading several measures of global patent filings.[53][54] China has the second-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $17.9 trillion as of 2021.[55] It also has two (Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing in the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively) of the global top 5 science and technology clusters, which is more than any other country.[51][56] As of March 2022, China has over 500 million 5G users and 1.45 million base stations installed.[57][58] Almost 493 million Chinese people are categorized as middle class, and 242 million are upper middle class, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey.[59] In 2022, mainland China's ten largest trading partners were European Union, United States, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, and Russia.[60]\n\n\nChina has free trade agreements with many nations, some of which are already in force (such as RCEP, the largest trade bloc in history) or are still in the negotiation phase.[61] Although widely regarded as the \"powerhouse of manufacturing\" or \"the factory of the world\",[62] exports contribute only a comparatively small proportion of the Chinese economy, at just 18.5% in 2020. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 142 are headquartered in China.[63] It has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers[64] and three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (both by market capitalization and by trade volume).[65] China's economy is both a contributor to rising global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions causing climate change and severely affected by its adverse impacts, although its per capita emissions are still much lower than developed economies such as the United States.[66]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economic history of China before 1912, Economic history of China (1912–1949), and Economic history of China (1949–present)\n\n![](image)GDP per capita in China from 1000 to 2018\nHistorically, China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.[34][67][68][69][70] China accounted for around one-quarter of the global GDP until the late 1700s and approximately one-third of the global GDP in 1820 as the Industrial Revolution was beginning in Great Britain.[71][72][73][74] China's GDP in 1820 was six times as large as Britain's, the largest economy in Europe – and almost twenty times the GDP of the nascent United States.[75]\n\n\nAt the end of the Chinese Civil War, the economy was devastated.[76] As the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan, they stripped China of liquid assets including gold, silver, and the country's dollar reserves.[76] By the time the KMT was defeated, commerce had been destroyed, the national currency rendered valueless, and the economy was based on barter.[76]\n\n\nThe People's Republic of China's development from one of the poorest countries to one of the largest economies was the quickest of any country.[77]: 11 From 1949 until the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the economy was state-led with market activity remaining underground.[78] Economic reforms began under Deng Xiaoping.[78] China subsequently became the world's fastest-growing major economy, with growth rates averaging 10% over 30 years.[79][80] Many scholars consider the Chinese economic model as an example of authoritarian capitalism,[81][82] state capitalism[83] or party-state capitalism.[84][85]\n\n\nChina has sustained growth due to export relations, its manufacturing sector, and low-wage workers.[6] China's was the only major world economy to experience GDP growth in 2020, when its GDP increased by 2.3%.[86] However, it posted one of its worst economic performances in decades because of COVID-19 in 2022.[87] In 2023, IMF predicted China to continue being one of the fastest growing major economies.[88]\n\n\n\n## Wealth in China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP, List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita, and List of Chinese prefecture-level cities by GDP per capita\n\nChina has had the world's largest middle class population since 2015,[89] and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018[*citation needed*] and is projected to reach 1.2 billion by 2027, making up one fourth of the world total.[90] As of 2018, China was first in the world in total number of billionaires and second in millionaires – there were 658 Chinese billionaires[91] and 3.5 million millionaires.[92] In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[93][94] In other words, as of 2019, a hundred million Chinese are in the top ten percent of the wealthiest individuals in the world – those who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000.[95] In 2020, China has the world's highest number of billionaires, which is more than the US and India combined,[96] and as of March 2021, the number of billionaires in China reach 1,058 with the combined wealth of US$4.5 trillion.[97] According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, China is home to six of the world's top ten cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Hangzhou and Guangzhou in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more than any other country.[97] As of January 2021, China had 85 female billionaires, two-thirds of the global total.[98]\n\n\n\n## Regional economies for China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Megalopolises in China and List of cities in China\n\n![](image)Distribution of GDP in mainland China\nChina's unequal transportation system, combined with important differences in the availability of natural and human resources and in industrial infrastructure, has produced significant variations in the regional economies of China.[99]\n\n\nEconomic development has generally been more rapid in coastal provinces than in the interior and there are large disparities in per capita income between regions. The three wealthiest regions are the Yangtze River Delta in East China; the Pearl River Delta in South China; and Jingjinji region in North China. It is the rapid development of these areas that is expected to have the most significant effect on the Asian regional economy as a whole and Chinese government policy is designed to remove the obstacles to accelerated growth in these wealthier regions. By 2035, China's four cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) are projected to be among the global top ten largest cities by nominal GDP according to a report by Oxford Economics.[100]\n\n\n\n### GDP by administrative division[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP\n\n\n\n\nList of 31 provinces in mainland China by Nominal GDP in 2022 (billions of GDP)[3]\n| provinces | CN¥ | US$ | share (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China(mainland) | 121,020.72 | 17,992.70 | 100\n |\n| Guangdong | 12,911.86 | 1,919.67 | 10.67\n |\n| Jiangsu | 12,287.56 | 1,826.85 | 10.15\n |\n| Shandong | 8,743.51 | 1,299.94 | 7.22\n |\n| Zhejiang | 7,771.54 | 1,155.43 | 6.42\n |\n| Henan | 6,134.51 | 912.05 | 5.07\n |\n| Sichuan | 5,674.98 | 843.73 | 4.69\n |\n| Hubei | 5,373.49 | 798.90 | 4.44\n |\n| Fujian | 5,310.99 | 789.61 | 4.39\n |\n| Hunan | 4,867.04 | 723.61 | 4.02\n |\n| Anhui | 4,504.50 | 669.70 | 3.72\n |\n| Shanghai | 4,465.28 | 663.87 | 3.69\n |\n| Hebei | 4,237.04 | 629.94 | 3.50\n |\n| Beijing | 4,161.10 | 618.65 | 3.44\n |\n| Shaanxi | 3,277.27 | 487.25 | 2.71\n |\n| Jiangxi | 3,207.47 | 476.87 | 2.65\n |\n| Chongqing | 2,912.90 | 433.07 | 2.41\n |\n| Liaoning | 2,897.51 | 430.79 | 2.39\n |\n| Yunnan | 2,895.42 | 430.48 | 2.39\n |\n| Guangxi | 2,630.09 | 391.03 | 2.17\n |\n| Shanxi | 2,564.26 | 381.24 | 2.12\n |\n| Inner Mongolia | 2,315.87 | 344.31 | 1.91\n |\n| Guizhou | 2,016.46 | 299.80 | 1.67\n |\n| Xinjiang | 1,774.13 | 263.77 | 1.47\n |\n| Tianjin | 1,631.13 | 242.51 | 1.35\n |\n| Heilongjiang | 1,590.10 | 236.41 | 1.31\n |\n| Jilin | 1,307.02 | 194.32 | 1.08\n |\n| Gansu | 1,120.16 | 166.54 | 0.93\n |\n| Hainan | 681.82 | 101.37 | 0.56\n |\n| Ningxia | 506.96 | 75.37 | 0.42\n |\n| Qinghai | 361.01 | 53.67 | 0.30\n |\n| Tibet | 213.26 | 31.71 | 0.18\n |\n\n\n### Hong Kong and Macau[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Hong Kong and Economy of Macau\n\nIn accordance with the one country, two systems policy, the economies of the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portuguese colony of Macau formally preserve a capitalist system separate from mainland China.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of administrative divisions of Greater China by Human Development Index\n\n![](image)China and other major developing economies by GDP per capita at purchasing-power parity (1990–2013) as the rapid economic growth of China (blue) is readily apparent[103]\nThe economic reforms implemented in 1978 helped to propel China into the ranks of the world's major economic powers. The economic development of Shenzhen has caused the city to be referred to as the world's next Silicon Valley.[104][105] The provinces in the coastal regions of China, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong, tend to be more industrialized while regions in the hinterland are less developed.\n\n\n\n![](image)China vs World by Nominal GDP per capita in 2020[106]\nTo guide economic development, the Chinese central government adopts \"five-year plans\" that detail its economic priorities and essential policies. The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) is currently being implemented, placing an emphasis on consumption-driven growth and technological self-sufficiency while China transitions from being an upper middle-income economy to a high-income economy.[107]\n\n\nThe public sector plays a central role in China's economy.[108] This development is also in line with the planning goals of the Chinese central government to achieve the \"Two Centenaries\", namely the material goal of China becoming a \"moderately prosperous society in all respects\" by 2021 and the modernization goal of China becoming a \"strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and modern socialist country\" by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.[109] China retains state control over the commanding heights of the economy in key industries like infrastructure, telecommunications, and finance despite significant marketization of the economy since reform and opening up.[110]: 20 Specific mechanisms implementing its control of the commanding heights in these areas include public property rights, pervasive administrative involvement, and Communist Party supervision of senior managers.[110]: 20\n\n\n\n![](image)Worlds regions by total wealth (in trillions USD), 2018\n![](image)China's share of global export 1990–2019\nLike Japan and South Korea before it, China's economy has grown rapidly, raising the income levels and living standards of its citizens while producing goods that are consumed globally. China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[111][112]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.[113] Between 1981 and 2019, the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty decreased from 88.1% to 0.2%.[5] Its current account surplus increased by a factor of 53 between 1982 and 2021, from $5.67 billion to $317 billion.[114] During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like clothing and footwear to the increasingly sophisticated production of computers, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. China's factories generated $3.7 trillion real manufacturing value added, more than the US, South Korea, Germany and the UK combined. China's manufacturing sector benefits from the world's largest domestic market, immense manufacturing scale, and highly developed manufacturing supply chains.[115]\n\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing. The measures included plans to build a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the Yangtze River.[116]\n\n\nIn terms of domestic saving, defined as combined saving of households, businesses, and governments, China is the world's largest saving country as of at least 2022.[117]: 27\n\n\n\n### Disputes over economic data[edit]\n\n\nThere exists disputes over reliability of official economic data. Foreign and some Chinese sources have claimed that official Chinese government statistics overstate China's economic growth.[118] However, several Western academics and institutions have stated that China's economic growth is higher than indicated by official figures.[119] Others, such as the Economist Intelligence Unit, state that while there's evidence China's GDP data is \"smoothed\", they believe that China's nominal and real GDP data are broadly accurate.[120]\n\n\n\n#### Overestimating[edit]\n\n\nChinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking their numbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose performance are often assessed based on how well their respective economies have performed.[121] Local governments have come under increased scrutiny over the last few years over economic data, with CCP general secretary Xi Jinping stating that economic data forgery \"not only hurt our judgment of the economic situation, but also seriously undermined the Communist Party’s ideas and truth-seeking style\".[118][122]\n\n\nA 2015 survey by *The Wall Street Journal* of 64 select economists found that 96% of respondents think China's GDP estimates don't \"accurately reflect the state of the Chinese economy.\"[123] However, more than half the economists in the survey estimated that China's annual growth was somewhere in the 5% to 7% range, which represents robust growth. During his tenure in Liaoning, future Chinese premier Li Keqiang has said he is far from confident in the country's GDP estimates, calling them \"man-made\" and unreliable, according to a leaked document from 2007 obtained by WikiLeaks. He said government data releases, especially the GDP numbers, should be used \"for reference only\".[124]\n\n\nIn 2016, analysts like Wilbur Ross and Donald Straszheim believed China's economic growth had been overstated, and estimate a growth rate at around 4% or less.[125] According to Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Michael Zheng Song, an economics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and coauthors, China's economy was smaller than what the Chinese government stated in 2016. In their research paper, published by the Brookings Institution in 2019, they adjusted the historical GDP time series using value-added tax data, which they said are \"highly resistant to fraud and tampering\".[126][127] They found that China's economic growth may have been overstated by 1.7 percent each year between 2008 and 2016, meaning that the government may have been overstating the size of the Chinese economy by 12–16 percent in 2016.[127][128]\n\n\n\n#### Underestimating[edit]\n\n\nSeveral Western academics and institutions have supported the claim that China's economy is likely to be underestimated.[129][130][131][119][132][133][134] A paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research claimed that China's economic growth may be higher than what is reported by official statistics.[135] An article by Hunter Clarka, Maxim Pinkovskiya and Xavier Sala-i-Martin published by the Elsevier Science Direct in 2018 employs an innovative method of satellite-recorded nighttime lights, which the authors claim to be a best-unbiased predictor of the economic growth in Chinese cities. The results suggest that the Chinese economic growth rate is higher than the official reported data.[129]\n\n\nThe Li Keqiang index is an alternative measurement of Chinese economic performance that uses three variables Li preferred.[136] Satellite measurements of light pollution are used by some analysts to model Chinese economic growth and suggest growth rate numbers in Chinese official data are more reliable, though are likely to be smoothed.[137] According to an article by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, China's official statistics are of a high quality compared to other developing, middle-income and low-income countries. In 2016, China was at the 83rd percentile of middle and low-income countries, up from the 38th percentile in 2004.[138] A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that China's official GDP statistics are \"significantly and positively correlated\" with externally verifiable measures of economic activity such as import and export data from China's trade partners, suggesting that China's economic growth was no slower than the official figures indicated.[119]\n\n\nThe study by Daniel Rosen and Beibei Bao, published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2015, showed that GDP in 2008 was actually 13–16 percent bigger than the official data, while 2013 GDP was accurately at $10.5 trillion rather than the official figure at $9.5 trillion.[132] According to a research conducted by Arvind Subramanian, a former economist at the International Money Fund (IMF) and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the size of the Chinese economy by Purchasing Power Parity in 2010 was about $14.8 trillion rather than an official estimate at $10.1 trillion by IMF, meaning that China's GDP was underestimated by 47 percent.[139]\n\n\n\n### Regional development[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |  | The East Coast(w/ existing development programmes) |\n|  |  | \"Rise of Central China\"\n |\n|  |  | \"Revitalize Northeast China\"\n |\n|  |  | \"China Western Development\"\n |\n\n\nThese strategies are aimed at the relatively poorer regions in China in an attempt to prevent widening inequalities:\n\n\n\n* China Western Development, designed to increase the economic situation of the western provinces through investment and development of natural resources.\n* Revitalize Northeast China, to rejuvenate the industrial bases in Northeast China.

1987–2022\nDuring the winter of 2007–2008, inflation ran about 7% on an annual basis, rising to 8.7% in statistics for February 2008, released in March 2008.[141][142][143]\n\n\nShortages of gasoline and diesel fuel developed in the fall of 2007 due to reluctance of refineries to produce fuel at low prices set by the state. These prices were slightly increased in November 2007 with fuel selling for $2.65 a gallon, still slightly below world prices. Price controls were in effect on numerous basic products and services, but were ineffective with food, prices of which were rising at an annual rate of 18.2% in November 2007.[144][145] The problem of inflation has caused concern at the highest levels of the Chinese government. On 9 January 2008, the government issued the following statement on its official website: \"The Chinese government decided on Wednesday to take further measures to stabilize market prices and increase the severity of punishments for those guilty of driving up prices through hoarding or cheating.\"[146][147]\n\n\nPork is an important part of the Chinese economy with a per capita consumption of 90 grams per day. The worldwide rise in the price of animal feed associated with increased production of ethanol from corn resulted in steep rises in pork prices in China in 2007. Increased cost of production interacted badly with increased demand resulting from rapidly rising wages. The state responded by subsidizing pork prices for students and the urban poor and called for increased production. Release of pork from the nation's strategic pork reserve was considered.[148]\n\n\nBy January 2008, the inflation rate rose to 7.1%, which BBC News described as the highest inflation rate since 1997, due to the winter storms that month.[149] China's inflation rate jumped to a new decade high of 8.7 percent in February 2008 after severe winter storms disrupted the economy and worsened food shortages, the government said 11 March 2008.[150] Throughout the summer and fall, however, inflation fell again to a low of 6.6% in October 2008.[151]\n\n\nBy November 2010, the inflation rate rose up to 5.1%, driven by an 11.7% increase in food prices year on year. According to the bureau, industrial output went up 13.3 percent. As supplies have run short, prices for fuel and other commodities have risen.[152]\n\n\n\n### Investment cycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Financial Street\nChinese investment has always been highly cyclical.[153] Ever since the 1958 Great Leap Forward, growth in fixed capital formation has typically peaked about every five years. Peaks occurred in 1978, 1984, 1988, 1993, 2003 and 2009. The corresponding troughs were in 1981, 1986, 1989, 1997 and 2005.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn China, the majority of investment is carried out by entities that are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are under the control of local governments. Thus, booms are primarily the result of perverse incentives at the local-government level.[154] Unlike entrepreneurs in a free-enterprise economy, Chinese local officials are motivated primarily by political considerations. As their performance evaluations are based, to a large extent, on GDP growth within their jurisdictions, they have a strong incentive to promote large-scale investment projects.[155][156]\n\n\nA typical cycle begins with a relaxation of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions.[157] The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as was the case in 2003).[158] Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular types of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.[159]\n\n\n\n## Macroeconomic issues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese economic reform\n\n### Environmental transition[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental policy in China, Water supply and sanitation in China, and health in China\n\n![](image)Historical annual CO2 emissions for the top six countries and confederations\nOver the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure of certain commodities and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s.[160]\n\n\nBy 2010, rapidly rising wages and a general increase in the standard of living had put increased energy use on a collision course with the need to reduce carbon emissions in order to control global warming.[161] There were diligent efforts to increase energy efficiency and increase use of renewable sources; over 1,000 inefficient power plants had been closed, but projections continued to show a dramatic rise in carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.[162] Since the late 2010s, a reduction of state-backed subsidies has negatively impacted several Chinese companies, with BYD Auto being one of them.[163][164][165][166]\n\n\nWhile not the largest source of historical cumulative emissions, today China accounts for one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.[167] On a per capita basis, China's emissions in 2019 (9 tonnes CO2-equivalent [tCO2e] per year) surpass those of the European Union (7.6 tCO2e) but remain slightly below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average (10.7 tCO2e) and well below the United States average (17.6 tCO2e). However, the carbon intensity of China's GDP—the amount of carbon used to generate a unit of output—remains relatively high.[66] To avoid the long-term socioeconomic cost[168] of environmental pollution in China,[169][170] it has been suggested by Nicholas Stern and Fergus Green of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment that the economy of China be shifted to more advanced industrial development with low carbon dioxide emissions and better allocation of national resources to innovation and R&D for sustainable economic growth in order to reduce the impact of China's heavy industry. This is in accord with the planning goals of the central government.[171] Chinese leader and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream is described as achieving the \"Two Centenaries\", namely the material goal of China becoming a \"moderately prosperous society\" by 2021, and the modernization goal of China becoming a fully developed nation by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.[172]\n\n\n\n### National debt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National debt of China\n\nIn 2022, China's total government debt stood at approximately CN¥ 94 trillion (US$ 14 trillion), equivalent to about 77.1% of GDP.[140] In 2014, many analysts expressed concern over the overall size of China's government debt.[173][174][175][176] At the end of 2014, the International Monetary Fund reported that China's general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio was 41.44 percent.[177][178] In 2015, a report by the International Monetary Fund concluded that China's public debt is relatively low \"and on a stable path in all standard stress tests except for the scenario with contingent liability shocks\", such as \"a large-scale bank recapitalization or financial system bailout to deal, for example, with a potential rise in NPLs from deleveraging\".[179]\n\n\nChinese authorities have dismissed analysts' worries, insisting \"the country still has room to increase government debt.\"[180] Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, earlier in 2016, commented that \"the ... debt pile facing China [is] an 'internal' problem, given the majority of the borrowings was issued in local currency.[181] Many economists have expressed the same views as Bernanke.[182] A 2019 survey by the OECD found that China's corporate debt is higher than other major countries.[183]\n\n\n\"Shadow banking\" has risen in China, posing risks to the financial system.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Regulatory environment and government revenues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxation in China\n\nThough China's economy has expanded rapidly, its regulatory environment has not kept pace. Since Deng Xiaoping's open market reforms, the growth of new businesses has outpaced the government's ability to regulate them. This has created a situation where businesses, faced with mounting competition and poor oversight, take drastic measures to increase profit margins, often at the expense of consumer safety. This issue became more prominent in 2007, with a number of restrictions being placed on problematic Chinese exports by the United States.[186]\n\n\n\n## Financial and banking system[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China bond yields 30 year bond\n 10 year bond\n 2 year bond\n 1 year bond\n\nMain articles: Banking in China, Foreign-exchange reserves of China, Hedge fund industry in China, and China Venture Capital Association\n\nChina has the world's largest total banking sector assets of around $45.838 trillion (309.41 trillion CNY) with $42.063 trillion in total deposits and other liabilities.[187][188] Most of China's financial institutions are state-owned and governed.[189] The chief instruments of financial and fiscal control are the People's Bank of China (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance, both under the authority of the State Council. The People's Bank of China replaced the Central Bank of China in 1950 and gradually took over private banks. It fulfills many of the functions of other central and commercial banks. It issues the currency, controls circulation, and plays an important role in disbursing budgetary expenditures. Additionally, it administers the accounts, payments, and receipts of government organizations and other bodies, which enables it to exert thorough supervision over their financial and general performances in consideration of the government's economic plans. The PBC is also responsible for international trade and other overseas transactions. Remittances by overseas Chinese are managed by the Bank of China (BOC), which has a number of branch offices in several countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther financial institutions that are crucial, include the China Development Bank (CDB), which funds economic development and directs foreign investment; the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), which provides for the agricultural sector; the China Construction Bank (CCB), which is responsible for capitalizing a portion of overall investment and for providing capital funds for certain industrial and construction enterprises; and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which conducts ordinary commercial transactions and acts as a savings bank for the public.[*citation needed*] China initiated the founding of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015 and the Silk Road Fund in 2014, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[190]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)\nChina's economic reforms greatly increased the economic role of the banking system. In theory any enterprises or individuals can go to the banks to obtain loans outside the state plan, in practice, 75% of state bank loans go to State Owned Enterprises. (SOEs)[191] Even though nearly all investment capital was previously provided on a grant basis according to the state plan, policy has since the start of the reform shifted to a loan basis through the various state-directed financial institutions. It is estimated that, as of 2011, 14 trillion Yuan in loans was outstanding to local governments. Much of that total is believed by outside observers to be nonperforming.[192] Increasing amounts of funds are made available through the banks for economic and commercial purposes. Foreign sources of capital have also increased. China has received loans from the World Bank and several United Nations programs, as well as from countries (particularly Japan) and, to a lesser extent, commercial banks. Hong Kong has been a major conduit of this investment, as well as a source itself. On 23 February 2012, the PBC evinced its inclination to liberalize its capital markets when it circulated a telling ten-year timetable.[193] Following on the heels of this development, Shenzhen banks were able to launch cross-border yuan remittances for individuals, a significant shift in the PBC's capital control strictures since Chinese nationals had been previously barred from transferring their yuan to overseas account.[194]\n\n\nChina has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen), more than any other country.[64] China has three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen), both by market capitalization and by trade volume.[65][195] As of 12 October 2020, the total market capitalization of mainland Chinese stock markets, consisting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, topped US$10 trillion, excluding the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with about US$5.9 trillion.[196]\n\n\nAs of the end of June 2020, foreign investors had bought a total of US$440 billion in Chinese stocks, representing about 2.9% of the total value, and indicating that foreign investors scooped up a total of US$156.6 billion in the stocks just in the first half of 2020.[197] The total value of China's bond market topped US$15.4 trillion, ranked above that of Japan and the U.K., and second only to that of the U.S. with US$40 trillion, as of the beginning of September 2020.[198] As of the end of September 2020, foreign holdings of Chinese bonds reached US$388 billion, or 2.5%, of the total value, notwithstanding an increase by 44.66% year on year.[199]\n\n\n\n### Stock markets[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Composite Index 1991–2022\nChina's stock market exchanges include the Beijing Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (including the STAR Market), the Shenzen Stock Exchange, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. China's stock market is relatively underdeveloped compared to other aspects of its economy.[200]: 148–150\n\n\nTo be listed on China's stock exchange, companies must demonstrate good financial standing (including sustained profitability), solid corporate governance (for example, with a board of independent directors, supervisory board, auditing, and no history of misreporting or fraud) and have a market capitalization equivalent to at least US$4 million.[86]: 271–272\n\n\nWhen the stock markets re-opened in the PRC period in 1990, most of the listed companies were state-owned enterprises; this was part of an experiment in subjecting SOEs to market discipline.[200]: 152–153 The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were under municipal control and termed \"experimental points\" until 1997.[201]: 102–103 In 1997, the central government brought the exchanges under central government control and affirmed that the exchanges had a legitimate role in the socialist market economy.[201]: 102\n\n\nIn 2015, a stock market plunge in China eliminated $2 trillion of global stock market value.[200]: 147\n\n\n\n### Currency system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Renminbi\n\n![](image)USD/CNY exchange rate 1981–2022\nThe renminbi (\"people's currency\") is the currency of China, denominated as the yuan, subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. The ISO 4217 abbreviation is CNY, although also commonly abbreviated as \"RMB\". As of 2005, the yuan was generally considered by outside observers to be undervalued by about 30–40%.[202][203] However, in 2017, the IMF stated that the yuan was correctly valued.[204]\n\n\nThe renminbi is held in a floating exchange-rate system managed primarily against the US dollar. On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe rate of exchange (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's balance of trade, inflation, measured by the consumer price index and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's central bank has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.[205] An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.[206]\n\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.[207] The devaluation was accomplished by pegging the official rate to closing market rates. A market-based \"representative\" exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for designation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals.[208] Since the late-2000s, China has sought to internationalize the renminbi. As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most widely traded currency in the world.[209] In November 2015 in advance of G-20 and IMF meetings, IMF director Christine Lagarde announced her support for adding the yuan to the SDR currency basket. The announcement gave 'green-light' to official approval at 30 November IMF meeting.[210] The internationalization of the Chinese economy continues to affect the standardized economic forecast officially launched in China by the Purchasing Managers Index in 2005. As China's economy grows, so does China's Renminbi, which undergoes the process needed for its internationalization.[211]\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Fortune Global, of the world's 500 largest companies, 145 are headquartered in China.[212] As of 2022, China was home to 351 largest listed companies measured by revenue in the Fortune Global 2000, ranking second globally.[213] China is also home to more than two hundred privately held technology startups (tech unicorns), each with a valuation of over $1 billion, the highest number in the world.[214]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Virtually all arable land is used for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is among the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish. Major non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds, furnish China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high because of intensive cultivation, for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total, but China still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United States. China hopes to further increase agricultural production through improved plant stocks, fertilizers, and technology.\n\n\nAccording to the government statistics issued in 2005,[215] after a drop in the yield of farm crops in 2000, output has been increasing annually.\n\n\n\n![](image)Production of wheat from 1961 to 2004 (data from FAO in 2005, y-axis: production in metric tons)\nAccording to the United Nations World Food Program, in 2022, China fed eighteen percent of the world's population with only seven percent of the world's arable land.[216]\n\n\nAnimal husbandry constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the livestock output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of aquaculture. Pond raising has always been important and has been increasingly emphasized to supplement coastal and inland fisheries threatened by overfishing and to provide such valuable export commodities as prawns. China is also unmatched in the size and reach of its fishing armada with anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 boats, some as far afield as Argentina. Fueled primarily by government subsidies, its growth and activities have largely gone unchecked.[217]\n\n\n\n![](image)Timber transported from a woodlot in the hills of Zhangpu County, Fujian\nEnvironmental problems such as floods, drought, and erosion pose serious threats to farming in many parts of the country. The wholesale destruction of forests gave way to an energetic reforestation program that proved inadequate, and forest resources are still fairly meagre.[218] The principal forests are found in the Qin Mountains and the central mountains and on the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Because they are inaccessible, the Qinling forests are not worked extensively, and much of the country's timber comes from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, and Yunnan.\n\n\nWestern China, comprising Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, has little agricultural significance except for areas of floriculture and cattle raising. Rice, China's most important crop, is dominant in the southern provinces and many of the farms here yield two harvests a year. In the north, wheat is of the greatest importance, while in central China wheat and rice vie with each other for the top place. Millet and kaoliang (a variety of grain sorghum) are grown mainly in the northeast and some central provinces, which, together with some northern areas, also provide considerable quantities of barley. Most of the soybean crop is derived from the north and the northeast; corn (maize) is grown in the center and the north, while tea comes mainly from the warm and humid hilly areas of the south. Cotton is grown extensively in the central provinces, but it is also found to a lesser extent in the southeast and in the north. Tobacco comes from the center and parts of the south. Other important crops are potatoes, sugar beets, and oilseeds.\n\n\n\n![](image)Fish ponds near Daye, Hubei\nIn the past decade, the government has been encouraging agricultural mechanization and land consolidation to raise yields and compensate for the loss of rural workers who have migrated to the cities.[219] According to statistics by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the annual growth rate of agricultural mechanization in China is 6.4%. By 2014, the integrated mechanization rate had risen to nearly 60%, with the rate for wheat surpassing 90% and that for maize approaching 80%.[220] In addition to standard agricultural equipment like tractors, China's agriculture cooperatives have begun using high-tech equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles, which are used to spay crops with pesticides.[221] Good progress has been made in increasing water conservancy, and about half the cultivated land is under irrigation.\n\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms were introduced. First of all this began with the shift of farming work to a system of household responsibility and a phasing out of collectivized agriculture. Later this expanded to include a gradual liberalization of price controls; fiscal decentralization; massive privatization of state enterprises, thereby allowing a wide variety of private enterprises in the services and light manufacturing; the foundation of a diversified banking system (but with large amounts of state control); the development of a stock market; and the opening of the economy to increased foreign trade and foreign investment.\n\n\n\n### Housing and construction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Real estate in China\n\nThe real estate industry is about 20% of the Chinese economy.[222] As of 2023, real property accounts for 60% of Chinese household assets.[200]: 161 Also as of 2023, China has the highest rate of home ownership in the world.[200]: 170 90% of urban households own their home.[200]: 170\n\n\nCompared to other nations, investing in stock markets and other assets is harder due to currency controls within the country. As a result, many Chinese citizens own multiple properties, as they are one of the few ways in which it is comparatively easy to grow and preserve wealth. Due to this, many economists have speculated about a property bubble within the Chinese economy[223] On 16 July 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the housing market within the Chinese economy had grown to US$52 trillion, eclipsing the US 2008 housing market before the Financial Crisis.[224]\n\n\nDespite the possibility of a housing bubble, many people still choose to invest their assets in real estate market. On 19 December 2021, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, China's net worth reached $120 trillion in 2020 to overtake the U.S.'s $89 trillion as a red-hot real estate market drove up property value.[225]\n\n\n\n### Energy and mineral resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy policy of China\n\n![](image)Electricity production in China 1980–2019\n**Electricity:**\n* Production: 6.5 trillion kWh (2017)[226]\n* Consumption: 7.7620 trillion kWh (2020)[3]\n* Exports: 21.8 billion kwh (2020)[3]\n* Imports: 6.2 billion kwh (2015)[3]\n\n\n**Electricity – production by source:**\n\n\n\n* Coal: 61.2% (2022)[227]\n* Hydro: 14.9% (2022)\n* Wind: 9.3 (2022)\n* Solar: 4.7% (2022)\n* Nuclear: 4.7% (2022)\n* Natural gas: 3.1% (2022)\n* Other: 2.1% (2022)\n\n\n**Oil:**\n\n\n\n* Production: 3,527,000 bbl/d (560,700 m3/d) (2022)\n* Consumption: 6,534,000 bbl/d (1,038,800 m3/d) (2005) and expected 9,300,000 bbl/d (1,480,000 m3/d) in 2030\n* Exports: 443,300 bbl/d (70,480 m3/d) (2005)\n* Imports: 10,170,000 bbl/d (1,617,000 m3/d) (2022) [228]\n* Net imports: 2,740,000 barrels per day (436,000 m3/d) (2005)\n* Proved reserves: 16.3 Gbbl (2.59×10~~^~~9 m3) (1 January 2006)\n\n\n**Natural gas:**\n\n\n\n* Production: 47.88 km3 (2005 est.)\n* Consumption: 44.93 km3 (2005 est.)\n* Exports: 2.944 km3 (2005)\n* Imports: 0 m3 (2005)\n* Proved reserves: 1,448 km3 (1 January 2006 est.)\n\nChina has natural resources with an estimated worth of $23 trillion, 90% of which are coal and rare earth metals.[229] Since 1980, China's energy production has grown dramatically, as has the proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang.[230] Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. The northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70–75% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5 million barrels (560,000 m3) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields.[231] Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\n\nSince the early 2000s, China's clean energy sector has rapidly developed.[232]: 23 This growth has enabled renewable energy to have an important role in China's international cooperation, including South-South cooperation in which China is a major source of clean energy technology transfer to other developing countries.[232]: 4, 23\n\n\nThe 11th Five-Year Program (2006–10), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of clean coal technology. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n\nAs of 2021, China is facing its worst energy crisis in decades.[233] *The Guardian* reported that \"Companies in the industrial heartlands have been told to limit consumption, residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts, and annual light shows have been cancelled.\"[234]\n\n\n\n#### Mining[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Gold mining in China\n\nOutdated mining and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques [*citation needed*], but China's rapid industrialization requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from Australia and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as steel production rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon.\n\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were coal (nearly two billion tons), iron ore (310 million tons), crude petroleum (175 million tons), natural gas (41 million cubic meters), antimony ore (110,000 tons), tin concentrates (110,000 tons), nickel ore (64,000 tons), tungsten concentrates (67,000 tons), unrefined salt (37 million tons), vanadium (40,000 tons), and molybdenum ore (29,000 tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were bauxite, gypsum, barite, magnesite, talc and related minerals, manganese ore, fluorspar, and zinc. In addition, China produced 2,450 tons of silver and 215 tons of gold in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n\nIn 2019, the country was the world's largest producer of gold;[235] 3rd largest world producer of copper;[236] 3rd worldwide producer of silver;[237] the world's largest producer of sulfur;[238] the world's largest producer of phosphate;[239] the world's largest producer of molybdenum;[240] the world's largest producer of lead;[241] largest world producer of zinc;[242] the world's largest producer of vanadium;[243] largest world producer of tin;[244] the world's largest producer of titanium;[245] the world's largest producer of antimony;[246] 2nd largest worldwide producer of bauxite;[247] 3rd largest world producer of iron ore;[248] 6th largest world producer of manganese;[249] 7th largest world producer of nickel;[250] 10th largest world producer of cobalt;[251] in addition to being the world's largest producer of salt.[252] It was the world's 8th largest producer of uranium in 2018.[253] Furthermore, it is the largest world producer of jade and one of the world producers of topaz, tourmaline, peridot and diamond.\n  \n\nUntil the end of 2019, a total of 173 types of minerals have been discovered in China, including 13 types of energy materials, 59 metals, 95 types of non-metallic minerals and six types of water and gases. In 2019, the newly discovered geological reserves of oil were 1.12 billion tonnes, of which, 160 million tonnes were proven technically recoverable reserves. The newly discovered geological reserves of shale gas were 764.42 billion cubic meters, of which, 183.84 billion cubic meters were proven reserves. With respect to non-oil and gas minerals, the evaluation states that China has great prospecting potential for 24 major minerals, including coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, copper, lead, zinc, bauxite, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, antimony, nickel, gold, silver, lithium, pyrites, phosphate rock, potash, magnesite, fluorite, boron and barite.[254]\n\n\n\n#### Hydroelectric resources[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydroelectricity in China\n\n![](image)Three Gorges Dam\nChina has an abundant potential for hydroelectric power production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the southwest of the country, where coal supplies are poor but demand for energy is rising swiftly. The potential in the northeast is fairly small, but it was there that the first hydroelectric stations were built – by the Japanese during its occupation of Manchuria.[255]\n\n\nThirteen years in construction at a cost of $24 billion, the immense Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River was essentially completed in 2006 and produced more than 100TWh of energy in 2018.\n\n\n\n#### Coal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coal in China\n\n![](image)Coal mining in Inner Mongolia\nChina is well endowed with mineral resources,[256] the most important of which is coal. China's mineral resources include large reserves of coal and iron ore, plus adequate to abundant supplies of nearly all other industrial minerals. Although coal deposits are widely scattered (some coal is found in every province), most of the total is located in the northern part of the country. The province of Shanxi, in fact, is thought to contain about half of the total; other important coal-bearing provinces include Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, and Shandong.[257] Apart from these northern provinces, significant quantities of coal are present in Sichuan, and there are some deposits of importance in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou.[257] A large part of the country's reserves consists of good bituminous coal, but there are also large deposits of lignite. Anthracite is present in several places (especially Liaoning, Guizhou, and Henan), but overall, it is not very significant.[258]\n\n\nTo ensure a more even distribution of coal supplies and to reduce the strain on the less than adequate transportation network, the authorities pressed for the development of a large number of small, locally run mines throughout the country. This campaign was energetically pursued after the 1960s, with the result that thousands of small pits have been established, and they produce more than half the country's coal. This output, however, is typically expensive and is used for local consumption. It has also led to a less than stringent implementation of safety measures in these unregulated mines, which cause several thousands of deaths each year.[259]\n\n\nCoal makes up the bulk of China's energy consumption (70% in 2005, 55% in 2021), and China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. As China's economy continues to grow, China's coal demand is projected to rise significantly. Although coal's share of China's overall energy consumption will decrease, coal consumption will continue to rise in absolute terms. China's continued and increasing reliance on coal as a power source has contributed significantly to putting China on the path to becoming the world's largest emitter of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.\n\n\nAs of 2015, falling coal prices resulted in layoffs at coal mines in the northeast.[260]\n\n\n\n#### Oil and natural gas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Petroleum industry in China\n\n![](image)Chinese oil reserves\nChina's onshore oil resources are mostly located in the Northeast and in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Oil shale is found in a number of places, especially at Fushun in Liaoning, where the deposits overlie the coal reserves, as well as in Guangdong. High quality light oil has been found in the Pearl River estuary of the South China Sea, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, and the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. The country consumes most of its oil output but does export some crude oil and oil products. China has explored and developed oil deposits in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Bohai Sea.\n\n\nIn 2013, the pace of China's economic growth exceeded the domestic oil capacity and floods damaged the nation's oil fields in the middle of the year. Consequently, China imported oil to compensate for the supply reduction and surpassed the US in September 2013 to become the world's largest importer of oil.[261]\n\n\nThe total extent of China's natural gas reserves is unknown, as relatively little exploration for natural gas has been done.[262] Sichuan accounts for almost half of the known natural gas reserves and production.[263] Most of the rest of China's natural gas is associated gas produced in the Northeast's major oil fields, especially Daqing oilfield. Other gas deposits have been found in the Qaidam Basin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang, and offshore to the southwest of Hainan Island.[264] According to an article published in Energy Economics in 2011 by economists Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich) and Abdul Jalil (Wuhan University in China), financial development in China has not taken place at the expense of environmental pollution and financial development has led to a decrease in environmental pollution. Authors conclude that carbon emissions are mainly determined by income, energy consumption and trade openness and their findings confirm the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve in the case of China.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Metals and nonmetals[edit]\n\n\nIron ore reserves are found in most provinces, including Hainan. Gansu, Guizhou, southern Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces have rich deposits. The largest mined reserves are located north of the Yangtze River and supply neighboring iron and steel enterprises. With the exception of nickel, chromium, and cobalt, China is well supplied with ferroalloys and manganese. Reserves of tungsten are also known to be fairly large. Copper resources are moderate, and high-quality ore is present only in a few deposits. Discoveries have been reported from Ningxia. Lead and zinc are available, and bauxite resources are thought to be plentiful. China's antimony reserves are the largest in the world. Tin resources are plentiful, and there are fairly rich deposits of gold. China is the world's fifth largest producer of gold and in the early 21st century became an important producer and exporter of rare metals needed in high-technology industries.\n\n\nChina also produces a fairly wide range of nonmetallic minerals. One of the most important of these is salt, which is derived from coastal evaporation sites in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning, as well as from extensive salt fields in Sichuan, Ningxia, and the Qaidam Basin. There are important deposits of phosphate rock in a number of areas, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hubei. Production has been accelerating every year. As of 2013 China is producing 97,000,000 metric tons of phosphate rock a year.[266] Pyrites occur in several places; Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have the most important deposits. China also has large resources of fluorite (fluorspar), gypsum, asbestos, and has the world's largest reserves and production of cement, clinker and limestone.\n\n\n\n### Industry and manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n\"Made in China\" redirects here. For other uses, see Made in China (disambiguation).\n\nFurther information: Industry of China and Technological and industrial history of China\n\n![](image)China Railway HXD1B Manufactured by CRRC\n![](image)Fuxing high speed train produced by CRRC\nChina has a strong position global position in the production of industrial goods and some of its companies are global leader in the areas of steel, solar energy, and telecommunications accessories.[267]: 131 As of 2022[update], industry accounts for 39.9% of China's GDP.[3] As of 2023, China manufactures approximately one fifth of the world's total output of industrial products.[267]: 133\n\n\n\n![](image)C919 developed by Chinese aerospace manufacturer Comac\nIn November 2012, the State Council of the People's Republic of China mandated a \"social risk assessment\" for all major industrial projects. This requirement followed mass public protests in some locations for planned projects or expansions.[268]\n\n\nMajor industries include mining and ore processing; iron and steel; aluminium; coal; machinery; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemical; fertilizers; food processing; automobiles and other transportation equipment including rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; consumer products including footwear, toys, and electronics; telecommunications and information technology.\n\n\nSince the founding of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation.[269] Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone now account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output.[270] In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered at the hands of a system that has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than ten percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization.[271]\n\n\nThe predominant focus of development in the chemical industry is to expand the output of chemical fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic fibers. The growth of this industry has placed China among the world's leading producers of nitrogenous fertilizers. In the consumer goods sector the main emphasis is on textiles and clothing, which also form an important part of China's exports. Textile manufacturing, a rapidly growing proportion of which consists of synthetics, account for about ten percent of the gross industrial output and continues to be important, but less so than before. The industry tends to be scattered throughout the country, but there are a number of important textile centers, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Harbin.[272][273] There is a growing consumer culture in China.\n\n\n\n#### Steel industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Steel industry in China, List of steel producers, and List of countries by steel production\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers of Guangzhou\nIn 2020, China produced over 1053 million tonnes of steel, over half of the world total. This was an increase of 5.6% over the previous year as global steel production fell by 0.9%. China's share of global crude steel production increased from 53.3% in 2019 to 56.5% in 2020. Decreasing -2.1% in 2021.[274]\n\n\nIron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140 million tons in 2000 increased to 419 million tons in 2006 and 928 million tons by 2018.\n\n\nChina was the top exporter of steel in the world in 2018; export volumes in 2018 were 66.9 million tons, a nine percent decrease over the previous year. It again decreased in 2021 to 66.2 million tons.[275] The decline slowed China's decade-old steel export growth. As of 2012 steel exports faced widespread anti-dumping taxes and had not returned to pre-2008 levels.[276] Domestic demand remained strong, particularly in the developing west where steel production in Xinjiang was expanding.[277]\n\n\nFor the year 2018, China's steel industry reported profits of CNY 470 billion ($70 billion), which was 39% higher than the year before.[278]\n\n\nOf the 45 largest steel producing companies in the world, 21 are Chinese, including the world's largest, China Baowu Steel Group.\n\n\n\n#### Automotive industry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Automotive industry in China\n\nChina is the world's largest automobile producer, manufacturing more than 27 million vehicles in 2018. For comparison, the corresponding numbers for the US and Japan were 11.3 million and 9.7 million respectively. By 2006 China had become the world's third largest automotive vehicle manufacturer (after US and Japan) and the second largest consumer (only after the US). However, four years later, in 2010, China was manufacturing more vehicles than the U.S. and Japan combined. Automobile manufacturing has soared during the reform period. In 1975 only 139,800 automobiles were produced annually, but by 1985 production had reached 443,377, then jumped to nearly 1.1 million by 1992 and increased fairly evenly each year up until 2001, when it reached 2.3 million. In 2002 production rose to nearly 3.25 million and then jumped to 4.44 million in 2003, 5.07 million in 2004, 5.71 million in 2005, 7.28 million in 2006, 8.88 million in 2007, 9.35 million in 2008 and 13.83 million in 2009. China has become the number-one automaker in the world as of 2009. Domestic sales have kept pace with production. After respectable annual increases in the mid- and late 1990s, passenger car sales soared in the early 2000s.\n\n\nIn 2010, China became the world's largest automotive vehicle manufacturer as well as the largest consumer ahead of the United States with an estimated 18 million new cars sold.[279] However, new car sales grew only by an estimated 1% between 2011 and 2012 due to the escalation in the Spratly Islands dispute, which involved Japan, the world's third largest producer of vehicles.[280]\n\n\nChina's automotive industry has been so successful that it began exporting car parts in 1999. China began to plan major moves into the automobile and components export business starting in 2005. A new Honda factory in Guangzhou was built in 2004 solely for the export market and was expected to ship 30,000 passenger vehicles to Europe in 2005. By 2004, twelve major foreign automotive manufacturers had joint-venture plants in China. They produced a wide range of automobiles, minivans, sport utility vehicles, buses, and trucks. In 2003 China exported US$4.7 billion worth of vehicles and components. The vehicle export was 78,000 units in 2004, 173,000 units in 2005, and 340,000 units in 2006. The vehicle and component export is targeted to reach US$70 billion by 2010.[*citation needed*] China's exports of cars increased significantly since 2020, becoming the world's second-largest exporter of cars in 2022 after Japan.[281]\n\n\nThe market for domestically produced cars, under a local name, is likely to continue to grow both inside China and outside. Companies such as Geely, Qiantu and Chery are constantly evaluating new international locations, both in developing and developed countries.[282]\n\n\n\n#### Electric vehicle industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Electric vehicle industry in China and Plug-in electric vehicles in China\n\n![](image)BYD with Dual Mode hybrid engine\nThe electric vehicle industry in China is the largest in the world, accounting for around 57.4% of global production of EVs and around 500,000 exports in 2021.[283] In 2021, CAAM reported China had sold 3.34 million passenger electric vehicles, consisting 2.73 million BEVs (battery-only EVs) and 0.6 million PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles),[284] which is around 53% share of the global market of 6.23 million \"new energy\" passenger vehicles – BEVs, PHEVs, and HEVs.[285] China also dominates the plug-in electric bus and light commercial vehicle market, reaching over 500,000 buses (98% of global stock) and 247,500 electric commercial vehicles (65% of global stock) in 2019,[286] and recording new sales of 186,000 commercial EVs in 2021.[284]\n\n\nPlug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales was 15% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2021.[287] NEV adoption rapidly increased to a record 28% in March 2022, and according to BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu could reach 35% by end of 2022, exceeding the government goal of 20% by 2025.[288] The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots.[289]\n\n\nThe battery industry is closely related to the EV industry as batteries constitute around 1/3 of the cost of EVs[290] and around 80% of lithium-ion batteries in the world are used in EVs.[291] The industry also has significant Chinese presence, with major players including world's largest CATL, BYD, CALB, Gotion, SVOLT and WeLion.[292]\n\n\n\n#### Semiconductor industry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Semiconductor industry in China\n\nThe Chinese semiconductor industry, including IC design and manufacturing, forms a major part of China's IT industry. China's semiconductor industry consists of a wide variety of companies, from integrated device manufacturers to pure-play foundries to fabless semiconductor companies. Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) design and manufacture integrated circuits. Pure-play foundries only manufacture devices for other companies, without designing them, while fabless semiconductor companies only design devices. Examples of Chinese IDMs are YMTC and CXMT, examples of Chinese pure-play foundries are SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor and Wingtech, and examples of Chinese fabless companies are Zhaoxin, HiSilicon and UNISOC.\n\n\nChina is the currently the world's largest semiconductor market in terms of consumption. In 2020, China represented 53.7% of worldwide chip sales, or $239.45 billion out of $446.1 billion. However, a large percentage are imported from multinational suppliers. In 2020, imports took up 83.38% ($199.7 billion) of total chip sales. In response, the country has launched a number of initiatives to close the gap, including investing $150 billion into its domestic IC industry, with a \"Made in China 2025\" goal of 70% domestic production.[293][294][295]\n\n\nChina leads the world in terms of number of new fabs under construction, with 8 out of 19 worldwide in 2021, and 17 fabs in total are expected to start construction from 2021 to 2023. Total installed capacity of Chinese-owned chipmakers will also increase from 2.96 million wafers per month (wpm) in 2020 to 3.572 million wpm in 2021.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other industries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Electronics industry in China, Pharmaceutical industry in China, and Shipping industry of China\n\nSubstantial investments were made in the manufacture of solar panels and wind generators by a number of companies, supported by liberal loans by banks and local governments. However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to anti-dumping penalties by both the United States and Europe. The global oversupply has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 but, even at the sharply reduced price resulting from oversupply, as of 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Huawei MateBook series at a World Mobile Congress\nChina is the world's biggest sex toy producer and accounts for 70% of the worldwide sex toys production.[297] In the country, 1,000 manufacturers are active in this industry, which generates about two billion dollars a year.[297]\n\n\nAs of 2011, China was the world's largest market for personal computers[298] Since 2019, Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motors, Kia Motors and LG Electronics are moving some or all production out of China, in order to reduce overdependence on the Chinese market and avoid risks related with increased local competition, China's economic slowdown and the US-China trade war.[299]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated shops, rationing, and regulated prices – with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The wholesale and retail trade has expanded quickly, with numerous shopping malls, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas. Public administration remains a main component of the service sector, while tourism has become a significant factor in employment and a source of foreign exchange.[300]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Telecommunications in China and Telecommunications industry in China\n\nThe affordability of mobile phones and internet data in China has resulted in the number of mobile internet users in China surpassing the number of computer internet users.[301]: 178\n\n\nChina's number of Internet users or netizens topped 137 million by the end of 2006,[302] an increase of 23.4% from a year before and 162 million by June 2007, making China the second-largest Internet user after the United States, according to China's Ministry of Information Industry (MII). China's mobile phone penetration rate was 34% in 2007. In 2006, mobile phone users sent 429 billion text messages (on average 967 text messages per user). For 2006, the number of fixed-lines grew by 79%, mainly in the rural areas.[303] By 2021, the number of Internet users in China increased to over 1.05 billion.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer internet[edit]\n\n\nChina's economy is one of the world's leaders in consumer internet and mobile payments.[267]: 130 Mobile payment methods via apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay were quickly adopted in China in part due to the relative lack of credit cards in the country.[267]: 130 This technological leapfrogging also led to a boom in online shopping and retail banking.[267]: 130\n\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in China and List of World Heritage Sites in China\n\nChina hosts the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (55). China's tourism industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the national economy and is also one of the industries with a very distinct global competitive edge. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, travel and tourism directly contributed CNY 1,362 billion (US$216 billion) to the Chinese economy (about 2.6% of GDP).[305] In 2011, total international tourist arrivals was 58 million, and international tourism receipts were US$48 billion.[306]\n\n\nChinese business travel spending is also forecast to be the highest in the world by 2014, overtaking the United States. According to a Global Business Travel Association study, total business-travel spending is expected to reach US$195 billion in 2012.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Luxury goods[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Luxury goods of China\n\nHong Kong and Macau benefit from favorable taxation rules and are favored locations for tourists from elsewhere in China to purchase luxury goods like cosmetics, jewelry, and designer fashion goods.[308]: 116\n\n\nPorcelain has long been one of China's most important luxury exports.[308]: 226 It was especially important to early trade between China and the West, with much of that trade being conducted through Macau.[308]: 226\n\n\nAfter a 2012 ban on government agencies purchasing luxury goods, often used as \"gifts\", sales of luxury goods in China remained strong but slowed, even falling slightly for luxury retailers in the 4th quarter of 2012,[309] with sales of shark fins and edible swallow nests, once staples of lavish government banquets, down sharply.[310]\n\n\nMany shops in international travel destinations have specialized staff devoted to Chinese customers.[309]\n\n\n\n## Labor and welfare[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Labor relations in China and Social welfare in China\n\n![](image)A window washer on a skyscraper in Shanghai\n![](image)A worker makes ceramics in Yunnan\n![](image)A Chinese coal miner at the Jin Hua Gong MineIn 1979–1980, the state reformed factories by giving wage increases to workers, which was immediately offset by sharply rising inflation rates of 6–7%. The reforms also dismantled the iron rice bowl, which meant it witnessed a rise in unemployment in the economy. In 1979–80 there were twenty million unemployed people.[311]\n\n\n![](image)This chart shows the Chinese employment by sectors during time[312]\nChina's estimated employed labor force in 2005 totaled 791 million persons, about 60% of the total population. During 2003, 49% of the labor force worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; 22% in mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction industries; and 29% in the services sector and other categories. In 2004 some 25 million persons were employed by 743,000 private enterprises. Urban wages rose rapidly from 2004 to 2007, at a rate of 13 to 19% per year with average wages near $200/month in 2007.[313] By 2016 the average monthly wage for workers engaged in manufacturing goods for export was $424. This wage, combined with other costs of doing business in China, had, more or less, equalized any Chinese cost advantage with respect to developed economies.[314]\n\n\nThe All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the country's only legally permissible trade union. Attempts to form trade unions independent of the ACFTU have been rare and short-lived. One notable example is the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation formed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Martial Law Command Headquarters issued a public notice declaring the BWAF an illegal organization and ordering it to disband on the grounds that Federation leaders were among \"the main instigators and organizers in the capital of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.[315][316]\n\n\nIn 2010, the issues of manufacturing wages caused a wildcat strike at a Honda parts plant. This resulted in wage increases both at the struck plant and other industrial plants.[317][318][319][320][321]\n\n\nThe 2010 census found that China was now half urban and rapidly aging due to the one child policy. This is expected to lead to increased demand for labor to take care of an elderly population and a reduced supply of migrant labor from the countryside.[322]\n\n\nDue to worsening pollution, the corruption and political uncertainties of the one-party state and the limited economic freedom in an economy dominated by large state-owned enterprises, many skilled professionals are either leaving the country or preparing safety nets for themselves abroad.[323][324][325] In the decade up to 2014, ten million Chinese emigrated to other countries, taking assets and their technical skills.[326]\n\n\nA law approved February 2013 will mandate a nationwide minimum wage at 40% average urban salaries to be phased in fully by 2015.[327]\n\n\n\n## State-owned enterprises[edit]\n\n\nMain article: State-owned enterprises of China\n\nChina's SOEs perform important functions that benefit the state.[328] Academic Wendy Leutert writes, \"They contribute to central and local governments revenues through dividends and taxes, support urban employment, keep key input prices low, channel capital towards targeted industries and technologies, support sub-national redistribution to poorer interior and western provinces, and aid the state's response to natural disasters, financial crises and social instability.\"[328]\n\n\nAs of 2017, China has more SOEs than any other country, and the most SOEs among large national companies.[328] State-owned enterprises accounted for over 60% of China's market capitalization in 2019[329] and generated 40% of China's GDP of US$15.98 trillion dollars (101.36 trillion yuan) in 2020, with domestic and foreign private businesses and investment accounting for the remaining 60%.[330][331] As of the end of 2019, the total assets of all China's SOEs, including those operating in the financial sector, reached US$58.97 trillion In 2015.[332] Ninety-one (91) of these SOEs belong to the 2020 Fortune Global 500 companies.[333]\n\n\n\n## External trade[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of trade of the People's Republic of China\nFurther information: List of the largest trading partners of China, List of exports of China, List of Chinese administrative divisions by exports, and China–United States trade war\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In 2010, China became the world's largest exporter, and has continued to be the world's largest exporter as of at least 2023.[334]: 88 It has free trade agreements with several nations, including ASEAN, Australia, Cambodia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea and Switzerland.[335][336] By 2020, China became the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries.[200]: 228 As of 2022[update], China's largest trading partners are ASEAN, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Russia, Brazil, India, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the Third World was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. However, after Mao Zedong's death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, Hong Kong and Taiwan both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, which promotes free trade and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\n\n\nChina became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001.[337] The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, U.S. exporters continue to have concerns about fair market access due to China's restrictive trade policies and U.S. export restrictions. In October 2019, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng promised to further decrease tariffs and remove non-tariff barriers for global investors, he also welcomed multinational companies to invest more in China.[338]\n\n![](image)With bilateral trade exceeding US$38.6 billion, China is India's largest trading partner[339] and shown here is a Chinese container ship unloading its cargo at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Navi Mumbai, India\nChina's global trade exceeded $4.16 trillion at the end of 2013, having broken the hundred-billion mark in 1988 and half a trillion by 2001. China global trade exceeded US$6 Trillion in 2021[340]\nThe table below shows the average annual growth (in nominal US dollar terms) of China's foreign trade during the reform era:[341]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Two-way trade | Exports | Imports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981–1985 | +12.8% | +8.6% | +16.1%\n |\n| 1986–1990 | +10.6% | +17.8% | +4.8%\n |\n| 1991–1995 | +19.5% | +19.1% | +19.9%\n |\n| 1996–2000 | +11.0% | +10.9% | +11.3%\n |\n| 2001–2005 | +24.6% | +25.0% | +24.0%\n |\n| 2006–2010 | +15.9% | +15.7% | +16.1%\n |\n| 2016–2021 | +11.0% |  |\n\nThe vast majority of China's imports consists of industrial supplies and capital goods, notably machinery and high-technology equipment, the majority of which comes from the developed countries, primarily Japan[*citation needed*] and the United States[*citation needed*]. Regionally, almost half of China's imports come from East and Southeast Asia, and about a fourth of China's exports go to the same destinations[*citation needed*]. About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest ports in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233 billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%. China's share of total U.S. imports has grown from 7% to 15% since 1996.\n\n\nTrade volume between China and Russia reached $29.1 billion in 2005, an increase of 37.1% compared with 2004. A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, Van Jingsun, said that the volume of trade between China and Russia could exceed forty billion dollars in 2007.[342] China's export of machinery and electronic goods to Russia grew 70%, which is 24% of China's total export to Russia in the first eleven months of 2005. During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13 billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05 billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368 million during January–September 2005, twice that in 2004. By 2022, trade between China and Russia reached a record $190 billion,[19] with China becoming Russia's trading partner.[343]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in Nizhny Novgorod, the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its 11th Five-Year Program, adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n\nChina is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free-trade area which was signed into agreement in November 2020. The RCEP, which includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN nations, represents about a third of the world's population and 29% of global gross domestic product. The RCEP aims to eliminate tariffs on a variety of products within 20 years.[344] On 17 September 2021, China formally applied to join another large Asia-Pacific free-trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).[345]\n\n\n\n## Foreign investment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China, Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor, Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, China Investment Promotion Agency, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Ministry of Commerce (China)\n\nIn 2022, China was amongst the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $180 billion, though most of these were speculated to be from Hong Kong.[346] As of the end of June 2020, FDI stock in China reached US$2.947 trillion, and China's outgoing FDI stock stood at US$2.128 trillion. The total foreign financial assets owned by China reached US$7.860 trillion, and its foreign financial liabilities US$5.716 trillion, making China the second largest creditor nation after Japan in the world.[347]\n\n\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms. The Encouraged Industry Catalogue sets out the degree of foreign involvement allowed in various industry sectors. From the beginning of the reforms legalizing foreign investment, capital inflows expanded every year until 1999.[348] Foreign-invested enterprises account for 58–60% of China's imports and exports.[349]\n\n\nSince the early 1990s, the government has allowed foreign investors to manufacture and sell a wide range of goods on the domestic market, eliminated time restrictions on the establishment of joint ventures, provided some assurances against nationalization, allowed foreign partners to become chairs of joint venture boards, and authorized the establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises, now the preferred form of FDI. In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state.\n\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in Shanghai and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of stock in selected companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45 billion in foreign direct investment. China revised significantly its laws on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and China Foreign Equity Joint Ventures in 2000 and 2001. The Vice Minister of Finance Zhu Guangyao announced, foreign investors will be allowed to own up to 51% on domestic financial service companies. Formerly foreign ownership was limited to a 49% stake in these firms.[350]\n\n\nForeign investment remains a strong element in China's rapid expansion in world trade and has been an important factor in the growth of urban jobs. China's economic leadership on global capital flows emphasizes long-term infrastructure and development finance over short-term flows which, under the current order, have imposed large costs on many economies.[351] In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totaled about $145 billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) after the United States, receiving $39 billion in 1999 and $41 billion in 2000. China is now one of the leading FDI recipients in the world, receiving almost $80 billion in 2005 according to World Bank statistics. In 2006, China received $69.47 billion.[352] By 2011, with the U.S. seeing a decline in foreign investment following the 2008 financial crisis, China overtook it as the top destination for FDI, receiving over $280 billion that year.[353]\n\n\nAmid slowing economic conditions and a weakening yuan in 2015, December of that year saw a 5.8% drop in FDI to China.[354] While China's rank as the top receiver of FDI continued through 2014, the slowing of inbound investment in 2015 combined with a massive rebound in foreign investment to the United States resulted in the U.S. reclaiming its position as the top investment destination.[355] Data from the American Chamber of Commerce in China's *2016 China Business Climate Survey* confirms this trend, although it also demonstrates that China remains a top investment destination. This survey of over 500 members found that \"China remains a top three investment priority for six out of ten member companies,\" though this is a decline from the 2012 high of eight out of ten respondents considering China a top priority.[356]\n\n\nForeign exchange reserves totaled $155 billion in 1999 and $165 billion in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves exceeded $800 billion in 2005, more than doubling from 2003. Foreign exchange reserves were $819 billion at the end of 2005, $1.066 trillion at the end of 2006, $1.9 trillion by June 2008. In addition, by the end of September 2008 China replaced Japan for the first time as the largest foreign holder of US treasury securities with a total of $585 billion, vs Japan $573 billion. China's foreign exchange reserves are the largest in the world.[357]\n\n\nAs part of its WTO accession, China undertook to eliminate certain trade-related investment measures and to open up specified sectors that had previously been closed to foreign investment. New laws, regulations, and administrative measures to implement these commitments are being issued. Major remaining barriers to foreign investment include opaque and inconsistently enforced laws and regulations and the lack of a rules-based legal infrastructure. Warner Bros., for instance, withdrew its cinema business in China as a result of a regulation that requires Chinese investors to own at least a 51 percent stake or play a leading role in a foreign joint venture.[358]\n\n\nAnother major development in the history of foreign investment in China was the establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in September 2013.[359] The Zone is considered a testing ground for a number of economic and social reforms.[360][361] Critically, foreign investment is controlled via a \"negative list\" approach, where FDI is permitted in all sectors unless explicitly prohibited by the inclusion of a given sector on the negative list published by the Shanghai Municipal Government.[362]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2019, China's National People's Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law,[363] which comes into effect on 1 January 2020. Foreign investment in China comes with a number of ethical risks which pose major challenges which investors must navigate.[364]\n\n\nA 2021 McKinsey report estimated that the Chinese economy as currently the largest consumer economy measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, and that it is expected to add more consumption than any other country within the next decade. Due to this and the rapid continued growth of China's middle class, large multinational companies like Walmart, have been keen to invest in China to tap into the growing domestic consumer market.[365][366]\n\n\n\n### Chinese investment abroad[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A TCL television set\n![](image)A Meizu smartphone\n![](image)Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nSee also: Go Out policy\n\nOutward foreign direct investment is a new feature of Chinese globalization, where local Chinese firms seek to make investments in both developing and developed countries.[367] It was reported in 2011 that there was increasing investment by capital rich Chinese firms in promising firms in the United States. Such investments offer access to expertise in marketing and distribution potentially useful in exploiting the developing Chinese domestic market.[368]\n\n\nSince 2005, Chinese companies have been actively expanding outside of China, in both developed and developing countries. In 2013, Chinese companies invested US$90 billion globally in non-financial sectors, 16% more than 2012.[369]\n\n\nBetween January 2009 and December 2013, China contributed a total of $161.03bn in outward FDI, creating almost 300,000 jobs. Western Europe was the largest regional recipient of Chinese outward FDI, with Germany receiving the highest number of FDI projects for any country globally.[370]\n\n\nThere are two ways Chinese companies choose to enter a foreign market: organic growth and Merge & Acquisition (M&A). Many Chinese companies would prefer M&A for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Fast. M&A is the fastest way for a company to expand into another country by acquiring brand, distribution, talents, and technology. Chinese CEOs has been used to growing at 50%+ speed and do not want to spend capital.\n* China market. China has become the world's largest economy. Many Chinese acquire foreign companies and then bring their products/services to China, anything from premium cars to fashion clothing to meat to Hollywood movies.\n* Cheap capital access. The huge Chinese domestic market help many Chinese companies accumulated financial capital to do M&A. Chinese government also provides long-term, low-interest capital for companies to expand abroad.\n* Low risk. M&A helped Chinese companies avoid risk of failure of organic growth as they got an established company with everything in place.\n* Cheap labor. Some companies may move part of the manufacturing in high labor cost countries to China to reduce the cost and make the product more attractive in price.\n* Trade and policy barrier. Chinese companies in many sectors face quota limitation and high tax, which prevent them from being competitive in foreign markets.\n* Depressed assets. 2008–2010 global economic crisis created liquidity problems for a lot of western companies and reduced their market value. Chinese companies believe it is a great opportunity for them to buy these depressed assets at discount. China's direct foreign investment in non-financial sector growth from US$25 billion in 2007 to US$90 billion in 2013, more than three times.[371]\n* China is growing in investments and influencing power over Europe, and the EU has begun to take notice.[372]\n\n\nAt the beginning, state-owned enterprises dominate the foreign acquisition and most of the money goes to oil and minerals. Since 2005, more and more private companies start to acquire non-raw material foreign companies. Below is a list of the top 15 outbound deals from Chinese companies:[373]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Acquirer\n | Acquirer industry\n | Target\n | Target industry\n | Target country\n | Deal value in millions of USD\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3 February 2016\n | CNAC Saturn (NL) BV\n | Chemicals\n | Syngenta AG | Chemicals\n | Switzerland\n | 41,840.11\n |\n| 23 July 2012\n | CNOOC Canada Holding Ltd\n | Other financials\n | Nexen Inc | Oil and gas\n | Canada\n | 19,119.31\n |\n| 1 February 2008\n | Shining Prospect Pte Ltd\n | Other financials\n | Rio Tinto PLC | Metals and mining\n | United Kingdom\n | 14,284.17\n |\n| 2 June 2017\n | China Investment Corp\n | Alternative financial investments\n | Logicor Ltd\n | Non residential\n | United Kingdom\n | 13,742.43\n |\n| 14 July 2017\n | Nesta Investment Holdings Ltd\n | Other financials\n | Global Logistic Properties Ltd\n | Non residential\n | Singapore\n | 11,553.58\n |\n| 22 August 2017\n | China Unicom (BVI) Ltd\n | Telecommunications services\n | China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd\n | Telecommunications services\n | Hong Kong\n | 11,255.81\n |\n| 6 October 2016\n | Park Aerospace Holdings Ltd\n | Transportation and infrastructure\n | C2 Aviation Capital LLC\n | Transportation and infrastructure\n | United States\n | 10,380.00\n |\n| 14 October 2015\n | China Tower Corp Ltd\n | Telecommunications services\n | China-Telecommun tower asts\n | Wireless\n | China\n | 9,948.41\n |\n| 21 June 2016\n | Halti SA\n | Other financials\n | Supercell Oy | Software\n | Finland\n | 8,600.00\n |\n| 24 June 2009\n | Mirror Lake Oil & Gas Co Ltd\n | Oil and gas\n | Addax Petroleum Corp\n | Oil and gas\n | Switzerland\n | 7,157.40\n |\n| 1 October 2010\n | China Petrochemical Corporation | Oil and gas\n | Repsol YPF Brasil SA\n | Oil and gas\n | Brazil\n | 7,111.00\n |\n| 16 March 2016\n | Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd\n | Insurance\n | Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc\n | REITs\n | United States\n | 6,500.00\n |\n| 24 October 2016\n | Hna Tourism Grp Co Ltd\n | Travel services\n | Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc | Hotels and lodging\n | United States\n | 6,496.88\n |\n| 17 February 2016\n | Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co Ltd\n | Transportation and infrastructure\n | Ingram Micro Inc. | Computers and peripherals\n | United States\n | 6,067.41\n |\n| 22 March 2015\n | Marco Polo Industrial Hldg SpA\n | Other financials\n | Pirelli & C SpA\n | Automobiles and components\n | Italy\n |  |\n\n\nHowever, the fast growth and M&A deals did not change consumers' low quality and low-price perception of Chinese goods and brands. According to market consecutive research by the Monogram Group, a Chicago-based advertising agency, in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012, American consumers' willingness to purchase Chinese products across all categories except PC remained the same or became worse during 2007–2012. The only sector in which Americans were more likely to purchase was personal computers.[374]\n\n\n\n![](image)China's leader Xi Jinping and Poland's President Andrzej Duda during the inauguration of the China Railway Express in Warsaw, Poland, 20 June 2016\nMoreover, many M&A deals have failed because companies underestimated the challenges and failed to restructure the company.\n\n\nCase 1: Shanghai Auto acquired 48.9% of Korean Ssangyong at US$500 million in 2004, making it the most ambitious acquisition in Chinese auto industry at the time. Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.[375][376]\n\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint venture called TCL–Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n\n\n\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book *Resumption of Trading* by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n\n\n### Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$969 billion.[377]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of China\n\nFurther information: Migration in China, Urbanization in China, Chinese emigration, Standard of living in China, and Poverty in China\n\nSince the 1950s medical care, public hygiene and sanitation improved considerably, and epidemics were controlled. Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The population growth rate surged as the mortality rate dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate, and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958–60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population control drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per family policy was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around a billion, and by the early 2000s surpassed 1.3 billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.[378] China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world.\n\n\nAccording to a Forbes China Rich List (2007), China had 66 billionaires, the second largest number after the United States, which had 415. In the 2006 Forbes Rich List it stated that there were 15 Chinese billionaires.[379] In the 2007 Hurun Report, it lists 106 billionaires in China.[380] According to the latest Forbes report (2021), China has a total of 626 billionaires, after gaining 239 new billionaires since March 2020.[381]\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 Brookings report, China become the largest middle-class consumption market in the world and is deemed a \"priority market\" for major multinational firm. It also estimates that 1.2 billion Chinese will be part of the middle class by 2027, and makeup a quarter of the world's middle class.[382]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to statistics released by China's National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the size of the labor force, people aged 15 to 59, in China shrank slightly to 937.27 million people, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the CCP, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.[383]\n\n\n\n## Transportation and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in China\n\n![](image)Shanghai Maglev Train\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.[384]\n\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet military transport and logistics needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of ocean shipping was broadened considerably.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFreight haulage is mainly provided by rail transport. The rail sector is monopolized by China Railway and there is wide variation in services provided. In late 2007 China became one of the few countries in the world to launch its own indigenously developed high-speed train.[385] As rail capacity is struggling to meet demand for the transport of goods and raw materials such as coal, air routes, roads and waterways are rapidly being developed to provide an increasing proportion of China's overall transportation needs.[386]\n\n\nSome economic experts have argued that the development gap between China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.[387]\n\n\n\n## Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in China\n\n![](image)Tencent, one of the world's most valuable technology conglomerates\nScience and technology in China has in recent decades developed rapidly. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform, and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socio-economic development of the country as well as for national prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, artificial intelligence,[388] academic publishing, patents and commercial applications. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses. Its Thousand Talents Plan aims to attract innovative Chinese academics living abroad (as well as some foreigners) back to China in support of its economic innovation goals.[389]\n\n\n\n## Anti-monopoly and competition[edit]\n\n\nThe Chinese technology sector has been characterized as being dominated by few, larger entities including Ant Group and Tencent.[390] There have been attempts by the Xi Jinping Administration to enforce economic competition rules, and probes into Alibaba and Tencent have been launched by Chinese economic regulators.[391]\n\n\nThe crackdown on monopolies by tech giants and internet companies were followed with calls by the Politburo against monopolistic practices by commercial retail giants like Alibaba.[392] Comparisons have been made with similar probes into Amazon in the United States.[393]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Business portal\n\n\n* Bamboo network\n* Beijing Consensus\n* Central Financial Work Commission\n* China Securities Regulatory Commission\n* China Beijing Equity Exchange\n* China Circle\n* China Economic Databases\n* China Milan Equity Exchange\n* Dual circulation\n* Economy of the Han dynasty\n* Economy of the Ming dynasty\n* Economy of the Song dynasty\n* Grasping the large, letting go of the small\n* Group buying\n* Guo jin min tui\n* Hukou\n* Imperial Bank of China\n* Leading stocks\n* List of companies of China\n* List of largest Chinese companies\n* Oil shale in China\n* Panda bonds\n* Rural credit cooperative\n* Silk Road\n* Township and Village Enterprises\n* Three Rural Issues\n* Yangtze Delta\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In 2011, China set a new poverty line at RMB 2300 (approximately US$400).[6]\n2. **^** Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution.\n3. **^** Modeled ILO estimate.\n4. **^** GDP figures exclude Taiwan, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau\n5. **^** China had a hundred million wealthy people (each owning a net wealth of over US$110,000) and the US 99 million.
