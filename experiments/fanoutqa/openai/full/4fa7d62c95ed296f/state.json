The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed in 1854 and followed by the Treaty of Olympia in 1856; these two treaties forced the Squaxin to relocate to an Indian reservation. Olympia was incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859, and as a city in 1882.[7] It had a population of 55,605 at the time of the 2020 census,[3] making it the state's 23rd most populous city. Olympia borders Lacey to the east and Tumwater to the south.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Olympia, Washington\n\n![](image)The Old Capitol Building in 1906\nThe site of Olympia had been home to Lushootseed-speaking peoples known as the Steh-Chass (or Stehchass, later part of the post-treaty Squaxin Island Tribe) for thousands of years. Other Native Americans regularly visited the head of Budd Inlet and the Steh-Chass, including the other ancestor tribes of the Squaxin, as well as the Nisqually, Puyallup, Chehalis, Suquamish, and Duwamish. The first recorded Europeans came to Olympia in 1792. Peter Puget and a crew from the British Vancouver Expedition are said to have explored the site, but neither recorded any encounters with the resident Indigenous population. In 1846, Edmund Sylvester and Levi Lathrop Smith jointly claimed the land that is now downtown Olympia. In 1851, the U.S. Congress established the Customs District of Puget Sound for Washington Territory and Olympia became the home of the customs house. Its population steadily expanded from Oregon Trail immigrants. In 1850, the town settled on the name Olympia, at local resident Colonel Isaac N. Ebey's suggestion,[8] because of its view of the Olympic Mountains to the northwest. The area began to be served by a small fleet of steamboats known as the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet.\n\n\nOver two days, December 24\u201326, 1854, Governor Isaac I. Stevens negotiated the Treaty of Medicine Creek with the representatives of the Nisqually, Puyallup, Squawksin, Steh'Chass, Noo-Seh-Chatl, Squi-Aitl, T'Peeksin, Sah-Heh-Wa-Mish, and S'Hotl-Ma-Mish tribes. Stevens's treaty included the preservation of Indigenous fishing, hunting, gathering and other rights. It also included a section which, at least as interpreted by United States officials, required the Native American signatories to move to one of three reservations. Doing so would effectively force the Nisqually people to cede their prime farming and living space. One of the leaders of the Nisqually, Chief Leschi, outraged, refused to give up ownership of this land and instead fought for his people's right to their territory, sparking the beginning of the Puget Sound War. The war ended with Leschi's capture in 1856; he was executed two years later.\n\n\nThe 1949 Olympia earthquake damaged many historic buildings beyond repair, and they were demolished. Parts of the city also suffered damage from earthquakes in 1965 and 2001.\n\n\nInterstate 5 was built through the south side of the city in the late 1950s as a replacement for earlier highways that traveled through downtown Olympia. The freeway was originally planned to cut through the city, but was moved further out to save costs. It opened to traffic on December 12, 1958, and was later expanded in 1991.[9]\n\n\n\n## Geography and climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astronaut photograph of Olympia, Washington, taken from the International Space Station (ISS)\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 19.68 square miles (50.97\u00a0km2), of which 17.82\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (46.15\u00a0km2) is land and 1.86\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (4.82\u00a0km2) is water.[10] The cities of Lacey and Tumwater border Olympia.\n\n\nOlympia is at the southern end of Puget Sound on Budd Inlet, where the Deschutes River estuary enters the Sound. The river was dammed in 1951 to create Capitol Lake; in late 2022 the state government approved the dam's removal to restore the estuary at an unspecified date.[11]\n\n\nThe area is located near the southern limit of the Fraser Glaciation and the underlying sediments consist largely of Vashon-age till and outwash deposited at that time; the area also includes former lakebeds and alluvial deposits associated with proglacial lakes that existed in the area near the end of Vashon-stage glaciation. Residual glacial topography in the area includes drumlins, subglacial channels, and kettle lakes.[12] Much of downtown Olympia sits on reclaimed land. Tidewater areas were filled as early as the 1870s, but the major change occurred in 1910\u201311 with placement of the Carlyon Fill (named for mayor P.H. Carlyon). Over two million cubic yards of sediment were dredged, thereby creating a deep-water port at Olympia; the dredged material was used to fill tidelands, creating almost 30 blocks of what is now downtown.[13][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nThe region surrounding Olympia has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen *Csb*), whereas the local microclimate has dry summers and cool July and August overnight lows. It is part of USDA Hardiness zone 8a, with isolated pockets around Puget Sound in zone 8b.[14] Most of western Washington's weather is brought in by weather systems that form near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. It contains cold moist air, which brings western Washington cold rain, cloudiness, and fog. November through January are Olympia's rainiest months. City streets, creeks, and rivers can flood from November to February. The monthly mean temperature ranges from 38.4\u00a0\u00b0F (3.6\u00a0\u00b0C) in December to 64.1\u00a0\u00b0F (17.8\u00a0\u00b0C) in August. Seasonal snowfall for 1981\u20132010 averaged 10.8 inches (27.4\u00a0cm)[15] but has historically ranged from trace amounts in 1991\u201392 to 81.5\u00a0in (207\u00a0cm) in 1968\u201369.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart for Olympia\nOlympia averages 50 inches (1,270\u00a0mm) of precipitation annually and has a year-round average of 75% cloud cover. Annual precipitation has ranged from 29.92\u00a0in (760\u00a0mm) in 1952 to 66.71\u00a0in (1,694\u00a0mm) in 1950; for water year (October 1 \u2013 September 30) precipitation, the range is 32.71\u00a0in (831\u00a0mm) in 2000\u201301 to 72.57\u00a0in (1,843\u00a0mm) in 1998\u201399.[15] With a period of record dating back to 1948, extreme temperatures have ranged from \u22128\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 1, 1979, up to 110\u00a0\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C), on June 28, 2021; the record cold daily maximum is 18\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22128\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 31, 1950, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 69\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 22, 2006.[15] Between 1991 and 2020 the mean coldest daily maximum was right on the freezing point at 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0\u00a0\u00b0C) and the warmest night of the year averaged a very mild 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C).[15]\n\n\nOn average, 6.3 days annually reach 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C), 1.8 days stay at or below freezing all day, and 78 nights reach the freezing mark.[15] The average window for freezing temperatures is October 8 through May 3, allowing a growing season of 157 days, nearly 100 days shorter than in Seattle.[15]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Olympia Regional Airport, Washington (1991\u22122020 normals, extremes 1948\u2212present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 64(18)\n | 73(23)\n | 79(26)\n | 88(31)\n | 96(36)\n | 110(43)\n | 104(40)\n | 104(40)\n | 98(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 74(23)\n | 64(18)\n | 110(43)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 56.3(13.5)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 67.9(19.9)\n | 76.2(24.6)\n | 83.9(28.8)\n | 87.9(31.1)\n | 93.6(34.2)\n | 92.2(33.4)\n | 86.3(30.2)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 55.5(13.1)\n | 96.0(35.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 46.0(7.8)\n | 49.1(9.5)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 70.8(21.6)\n | 77.6(25.3)\n | 78.0(25.6)\n | 72.1(22.3)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 44.9(7.2)\n | 60.7(15.9)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 39.6(4.2)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 44.1(6.7)\n | 48.2(9.0)\n | 54.5(12.5)\n | 59.1(15.1)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 59.1(15.1)\n | 50.3(10.2)\n | 43.2(6.2)\n | 38.9(3.8)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 33.2(0.7)\n | 32.3(0.2)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 37.5(3.1)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 50.7(10.4)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 46.2(7.9)\n | 40.5(4.7)\n | 35.8(2.1)\n | 32.8(0.4)\n | 40.4(4.7)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 18.8(\u22127.3)\n | 19.0(\u22127.2)\n | 23.9(\u22124.5)\n | 27.5(\u22122.5)\n | 32.3(0.2)\n | 38.4(3.6)\n | 42.7(5.9)\n | 41.9(5.5)\n | 35.9(2.2)\n | 27.9(\u22122.3)\n | 21.6(\u22125.8)\n | 18.4(\u22127.6)\n | 12.6(\u221210.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | \u22128(\u221222)\n | \u22121(\u221218)\n | 9(\u221213)\n | 23(\u22125)\n | 25(\u22124)\n | 30(\u22121)\n | 35(2)\n | 33(1)\n | 25(\u22124)\n | 14(\u221210)\n | \u22121(\u221218)\n | \u22127(\u221222)\n | \u22128(\u221222)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 7.80(198)\n | 5.09(129)\n | 5.68(144)\n | 3.67(93)\n | 2.26(57)\n | 1.46(37)\n | 0.53(13)\n | 0.96(24)\n | 2.04(52)\n | 5.07(129)\n | 8.21(209)\n | 7.85(199)\n | 50.62(1,286)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 2.0(5.1)\n | 0.6(1.5)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 1.2(3.0)\n | 3.9(9.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 20.3\n | 16.4\n | 18.8\n | 16.3\n | 11.4\n | 8.5\n | 4.0\n | 4.8\n | 8.1\n | 15.1\n | 19.5\n | 20.2\n | 163.4\n |\n| Average snowy days (\u2265 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.7\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.8\n | 2.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 87.5\n | 84.5\n | 80.0\n | 75.6\n | 72.9\n | 72.4\n | 70.8\n | 72.1\n | 77.6\n | 85.1\n | 88.4\n | 89.1\n | 79.7\n |\n| Average dew point \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 36.0(2.2)\n | 36.9(2.7)\n | 39.2(4.0)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 48.9(9.4)\n | 52.0(11.1)\n | 52.7(11.5)\n | 49.6(9.8)\n | 44.8(7.1)\n | 39.6(4.2)\n | 35.4(1.9)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (dew points and relative humidity 1961\u20131990)[16][17] |\n| Source 2: National Weather Service[18] |\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The artesian spring at Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now called Capitol Way) was the main community well where settlers, as well as the local Steh-Chass and visiting Native Americans, gathered to socialize. Settler accounts recall paying Native Americans to collect water here. The artesian well at Artesian Commons park, a former parking lot, is active.[19] Another still flows at the corner of Olympia Avenue and Washington Street. A small park was constructed around another spring in the Bigelow Neighborhood.[20] The northeast end of Capitol Lake was the location of an artesian well until the construction of a new park that included changes to the shoreline. McAllister Springs, Olympia's main water source, is fed by artesian wells, and the former Olympia Brewery is supplied by 26 artesian wells.\n\n\nEfforts to protect and preserve the free-flowing artesian well on 4th Avenue in downtown Olympia began in 1991 with support from a local coffee roaster. Donations from the public were used to form \"Friends of the Artesians\", a group that researched the wells, maintained them, and tested their quality. They were later replaced by the non-profit organization H2Olympia in 2009.[21] In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 toward improvements of an artesian well in a parking lot that the city purchased the same year.[22] Renovations at the well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles. In spring 2012, sea-themed mosaic artwork created by community members was installed at the site of the well.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %\u00b1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 1,203 |  | \u2014 |\n| 1880 | 1,232 |  | 2.4% |\n| 1890 | 4,698 |  | 281.3% |\n| 1900 | 3,863 |  | \u221217.8% |\n| 1910 | 6,996 |  | 81.1% |\n| 1920 | 7,795 |  | 11.4% |\n| 1930 | 11,733 |  | 50.5% |\n| 1940 | 13,254 |  | 13.0% |\n| 1950 | 15,819 |  | 19.4% |\n| 1960 | 18,273 |  | 15.5% |\n| 1970 | 23,296 |  | 27.5% |\n| 1980 | 27,447 |  | 17.8% |\n| 1990 | 33,840 |  | 23.3% |\n| 2000 | 42,514 |  | 25.6% |\n| 2010 | 46,478 |  | 9.3% |\n| 2020 | 55,605 |  | 19.6% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 55,669 | [4] | 0.1% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[23]2020 Census[3] |\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 55,605 people within the city.

The winner of the event was Joan Benoit, who won a gold medal at the first women's Olympic marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympic games in Los Angeles.\n\n\nOlympia is the home of the Oly Rollers, the local women's flat track roller derby league whose travel team, the Cosa Nostra Donnas, were the 2009 national champions of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), winning the national Declaration of Derby tournament in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[29]\n\n\nOly Town FC (also known as Oly Town Artesians) is a soccer club that was founded in 2014 and primarily plays at Black Hill High School. They field an amateur men's team in USL League Two and the Evergreen Premier League, as well as a women's team in the Northwest Premier League.[30]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nOlympia's main public school district is the Olympia School District. It enrolled 9,782 students in K-12 in the 2021\u201322 school year.[31] The district has a total of 18 schools: 11 elementary schools, four middle schools and three high schools. Its high schools are Olympia High School (formally known as William Winlock Miller High School), Capital High School, and Avanti High School.\n\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 school year, Olympia began the Parent Partnership Program, which provides more opportunities to homeschooling families. Olympia's online high school, Olympia Regional Learning Academy (ORLA), is part of the same program. Private elementary schools include Olympia Waldorf School, Olympia Community School, St. Michael School, Holy Family, and Evergreen Christian.

Since 1983, Olympia has had a public, educational and government access television station, which was rebranded in 2016 as Thurston Community Media.[34] Olympia sits on the southern fringe of the FM signal of National Public Radio member station KUOW. An AM simulcast is transmitted from a tower in nearby Tumwater.[35] Evergreen State College's KAOS broadcasts a mix of educational and political programming, with student-driven music shows.[36]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\nAmtrak provides service to Olympia-Lacey at Centennial Station.

It is located in the center of the Willamette Valley alongside the Willamette River, which runs north through the city. The river forms the boundary between Marion and Polk counties, and the city neighborhood of West Salem is in Polk County. Salem was founded in 1842, became the capital of the Oregon Territory in 1851, and was incorporated in 1857.\n\n\nSalem had a population of 175,535 at the 2020 census,[8] making it the 3rd most populous city in the state after Portland and Eugene. Salem is the principal city of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area, a metropolitan area that covers Marion and Polk counties[9] and had a combined population of 433,353 at the 2020 census.[10] This area is, in turn, part of the Portland\u2013Vancouver\u2013Salem Combined Statistical Area.\n\n\nThe city is home to Willamette University, Corban University, and Chemeketa Community College. The State of Oregon is the largest public employer in the city, and Salem Health is the largest private employer. Transportation includes public transit from Cherriots (legally known as Salem Area Mass Transit District), Amtrak service, as well as limited commercial and non-commercial air travel at McNary Field.[11] Major roads include Interstate 5, Oregon Route 99E, and Oregon Route 22, which connects West Salem across the Willamette River via the Marion Street and Center Street bridges.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origin of name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Salem in 1876\nThe Native Americans who inhabited the central Willamette Valley at first European contact, the Kalapuya, called the area Chim-i-ki-ti, which means \"meeting or resting place\" in the Central Kalapuya language (Santiam).[12] When the Methodist Mission moved to the area, they called the new establishment Chemeketa; although it was more widely known as the Mill, because of its situation on Mill Creek.[13] When the Oregon Institute was established, the community became known as the institute.[13]\n\n\nWhen the institute was dissolved, the trustees decided to lay out a town site on the Institute lands.[13] Some possible sources for the name \"Salem\" include William H. Willson, who in 1850 and 1851 filed the plans for the main part of the city, and suggested adopting an Anglicized version of the Biblical Hebrew word \"\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd, Shalom\", meaning \"peace\" (as well as \"hello\" and \"goodbye\").[13][14] The Reverend David Leslie, President of the town's Trustees, also wanted a Biblical name, and suggested using the last five letters of \"Jerusalem\".[14] Or, the town may be named after Salem, Massachusetts, where Leslie was educated. There were many names suggested, and even after the change to Salem, some people, such as Asahel Bush (editor of the *Oregon Statesman*), believed the name should be changed back to Chemeketa.[15] The Vern Miller Civic Center, which houses the city offices and library, has a public space dedicated as the *Peace Plaza* in recognition of the names by which the city has been known.[15]\n\n\n\n### Europeans[edit]\n\n\nThe first people of European descent arrived in the area as early as 1812; they were animal trappers and food gatherers for the fur trading companies in Astoria, Oregon.\n\n\nThe first permanent American settlement in the area was the Jason Lee Methodist mission (1840) located in the area north of Salem known as Wheatland.[16] In 1842, the missionaries established the Oregon Institute (the forerunner of Willamette University) in the area that was to become the site of Salem. In 1844, the mission was dissolved and the town site established.\n\n\nIn 1851, Salem became the territorial capital after it was moved from Oregon City. The capital was moved briefly to Corvallis in 1855, but was moved back to Salem permanently that same year. Salem incorporated as a city in 1857, and with the coming of statehood in 1859, it became the state capital.\n\n\n\n### Capitol buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capitol building after 1935 fire\nOregon has had three capitol buildings in Salem. A two-story state house, which had been occupied for only two months, burned to the ground in December 1855. Oregon's second capitol building was completed in 1876 on the site of the original. The Revival-style building was based in part on the U.S. Capitol building. The building received its distinctive copper dome in 1893. On April 25, 1935, this building was also destroyed by fire. The third and current Oregon State Capitol was completed on the same site in 1938. It is recognizable by its distinctive pioneer statue atop the capitol dome that is plated with gold-leaf and officially named the *Oregon Pioneer*.\n\n\n\n### State fair and cherry festival[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oregon State Fair 1867\nAgriculture has always been important to Salem, and the city has historically recognized and celebrated it in a number of ways. In 1861, Salem was chosen as the permanent site of the Oregon State Fair by the Oregon State Agricultural Association.[17] Salem is nicknamed the \"Cherry City\", because of the past importance of the local cherry-growing industry.[18] The first cherry festival in Salem was held in 1903 and was an annual event, with parades and the election of a cherry queen, until sometime after World War I. The event was briefly revived as the Salem Cherryland Festival for several years in the late 1940s.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography and climate[edit]\n\n\nSalem is located in the north-central Willamette Valley, in Marion and Polk counties. The 45th Parallel (roughly the halfway point between the North Pole and the Equator) passes through Salem's city limits.\n\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 48.45 square miles (125.48\u00a0km2), of which 47.90 square miles (124.06\u00a0km2) is land and 0.55 square miles (1.42\u00a0km2) is water.[20]\n\n\nAlthough the Willamette River flows through Salem, the North Santiam River watershed is Salem's primary drinking water source. Other important streams that pass through Salem are Mill Creek, the Mill Race, Pringle Creek, and Shelton Ditch.[21] Smaller streams in the southern and southeastern parts of the city include Clark Creek, Jory Creek, Battle Creek, Croisan Creek, and Claggett Creek, while Glen Creek and Brush Creek flow through West Salem.[21]\n\n\nElevation within the city limits ranges from about 120 to 800 feet (37 to 244\u00a0m). Salem contains the volcanic Salem Hills in the south and is sandwiched by the 1,000\u00a0ft (300\u00a0m) Eola Hills directly to the west and the 600\u00a0ft (180\u00a0m) Waldo Hills to the east. Northern and eastern Salem are less hilly. South and West Salem contain some canyons and are the hilliest areas. The coast range and the Cascades\u2014including Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and on the clearest of days, Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams in Washington\u2014can be viewed from throughout the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart for Salem\nLike most of the Willamette Valley area, Salem has a mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen *Csb*). Rain is heaviest in late fall and throughout winter, and almost all of the annual precipitation falls between October and April, with a dry season from May through September.

Miller Civic Center, which is a complex of buildings, including a branch of the public library, a fire station, city hall, and the police department (until 2020.)\nSalem is governed using the council\u2013manager government model.[31] The city council consists of eight members who are elected from single member wards. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote.\n\n\nThe current mayor is Chris Hoy, a Democrat who took office in 2022.\n\n\nThe following are Salem's city councilors:[32]\n\n\n\n* Ward 1: Virginia Stapleton\n* Ward 2: Linda Nishioka\n* Ward 3: Trevor Phillips\n* Ward 4: Deanna Gwyn\n* Ward 5: Jose Gonzalez\n* Ward 6: Julie Hoy\n* Ward 7: Vanessa Nordyke\n* Ward 8: Micki Varney\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capitol Center in downtown\nState government is Salem's largest employer, but the city also serves as a hub for the area farming communities and is a major agricultural food processing center.[33] It lies along the I-5 corridor and is within an hour's drive of Oregon's largest city, Portland.\n\n\nSalem is the home of Kettle Foods, Inc., a maker of potato chips since 1982. Kettle employs 700 in Salem and at a plant in Bowthorpe, England. NORPAC Foods, Inc., is a large food processor in Salem and elsewhere in Marion County. Its brands include Flav-R-Pac and West-Pac frozen fruits and vegetables, and Santiam canned vegetables. Oregon Fruit Products, Inc., has been canning blackberries, marionberries and other fruits in Salem since 1935, with *Oregon* as its brand name.\n\n\nIn a bid to diversify its economic base, Salem attracted a number of computer-related manufacturing plants in the 1990s. In November 2003, the Sumitomo Mitsubishi Silicon Group (SUMCO), one of these arrivals, announced it would be closing its two silicon wafer plants at the end of 2004, eliminating 620 jobs, and moving production to other plants.[34]\n\n\nSalem is the headquarters of the Oregon Department of Corrections and home to four state correctional facilities, including the Oregon State Penitentiary, Oregon's only maximum-security prison.\n\n\nNumerous projects are underway to increase the supply of housing in the downtown core. These projects will provide upscale, low- and high-rise condominium and office space.\n\n\n\n### Top employers[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Salem's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the 2022 fiscal year,[35] the top employers in the area are:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Employer\n | Number of Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | State of Oregon | 21,000\n |\n| 2\n | Salem-Keizer School District | 5,137\n |\n| 3\n | Salem Health | 5,058\n |\n| 4\n | Marion County | 1,742\n |\n| 5\n | Federal Government | 1,500\n |\n| 6\n |  Amazon Fulfillment Center\n | 1,400\n |\n| 7\n | City of Salem\n | 1,291\n |\n| 8\n | Chemeketa Community College | 1,080\n |\n| 9\n | Wal-Mart | 980\n |\n| 10\n | State Accident Insurance Fund | 923\n |\n\n\n## People and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Neighborhood associations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Central area of Salem 1900\nSalem has 18 recognized neighborhood associations, which are independent groups that receive administrative support from the city.[36]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Central Area-Downtown (CAN-DO)\n* East Lancaster (ELNA)\n* Faye Wright\n* Grant\n* Highland\n* Lansing\n* Morningside\n* Northeast (NEN)\n* Northeast Salem (NESCA)\n* North Lancaster (NOLA)\n* Northgate\n* South Central (SCAN)\n* Southeast Mill Creek (SEMCA)\n* South East Salem (SESNA)\n* South Gateway\n* Sunnyslope\n* South Salem (SWAN)\n* West Salem\n |\n\n\n### Cultural events and series[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skateboarder in Marion Square Park\nThe nonprofit group Salem Community Markets (SCM) operates several farmers' markets in Salem.

There is also an indoor Saturday Public Market which is open all year.[37]\n\n\nThe annual World Beat Festival, held in June, is sponsored by the nonprofit Salem Multicultural Institute.[39] The event lasts for two days and is held at the Riverfront Park. It features international crafts, music, dance, food, and folklore from every continent, and in recent years has held a Dragon Boat race similar to the ones held during the nearby Rose Festival in Portland.[40]\n\n\nThe Salem Art Association sponsors the annual Salem Art Fair and Festival, which takes place at Bush's Pasture Park during the summer.[41] Its displays, interactive exhibits, food, and performances attract thousands of visitors each year.[42]\n\n\nThe Bite of Salem, held in July at the Riverfront Park, is an event similar to others such as the Bite of Oregon in Portland. The event consists of a weekend of local restaurants in Salem offering samples of their menus to patrons in a festival atmosphere, with live entertainment and benefiting local charities. In the summer, *Chef's Nite Out* is a wine and food benefit held for Marion-Polk Food Share.[43] Oregon Wine & Food Festival takes place at that state's fairgrounds in January.\n\n\nThe largest event in Salem is the Oregon State Fair at the end of August through Labor Day. Located in the Oregon State Fairgrounds in North Salem, the fair offers exhibits, competitions and carnival rides. Other events such as concerts, horse shows and rodeos take place at the Oregon State Fair and Expo Center throughout the year.[44]\n\n\nThe Mid-Valley Video Festival offers local, national and international independent films in theaters throughout the city.[45]\n\n\nThe Salem Film Festival has included feature films that were Oregon premieres.[46]\n\n\nThe Salem Repertory Theatre presents shows at the Reed Opera House.[47] The Pentacle Theatre, which features plays and musicals, is located in West Salem.[48] The Elsinore Theatre is a historic landmark featuring recitals, concerts, films, and plays. It has the largest working pipe organ on the west coast, a remnant of its days as a showcase for silent films, in the early days of cinema. Grand Theater is newly renovated and is the home of Enlightened Theatrics, a professional theatre company and hosts the Salem Progressive Film Series on the third Tuesday nine months of the year.\n\n\nCapitol Pride (Salem's yearly Gay Pride Event), hosted by Aundrea Smith (Author of: \"Your Local Queer\"; 2019) is held in early August.[49]\n\n\nThe personal house and garden of landscape architects Elizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver, known as Gaiety Hollow, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Their firm Lord & Schryver designed the gardens of Historic Deepwood Estate.\n\n\n\n### Museums and other points of interest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oregon State Capitol\n![](image)Downtown Salem looking west\nIn addition to the Oregon State Capitol and adjacent Willson Park, Salem's downtown contains the Willamette Heritage Center, Hallie Ford Museum of Art, the Elsinore Theatre, Riverfront Park, the Willamette River, some of the oldest buildings in Oregon, as well as shopping and restaurants. The A.C. Gilbert's Discovery Village interactive children's museum and Prewitt-Allen Archaeological Museum are both also located in Salem.[50]\n\n\nThe two leading candidates for the tallest building in Salem are Salem First United Methodist Church and the Capitol Center.[51] A private survey commissioned by a local publication holds that the church is the tallest.[52] The tall white spire of the 1878 church rises at the intersection of Church and State Streets across from the Capitol grounds. The Capitol Center (originally the First National Bank Building, then the Livesley Building) was built in 1927 by former Salem mayor Thomas A. Livesley, a prominent Salem-area businessman and civic leader. At that time of its completion, it was the tallest commercial building in the state.[51]\n\n\nIn 1988, Livesley's family home was purchased through private donations and was donated to the state. It now serves as the official residence of the Governor and family. Now known as Mahonia Hall, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1990.\n\n\nThe Oregon Symphony, based in Portland, presents approximately ten classical and pops concerts each year in Salem. The Salem Chamber Orchestra includes professional area musicians as well as students.[53] The Salem Armory Auditorium has hosted touring bands including Korn and Phish.\n\n\nThe Salem Concert Band is a community band made up of professional and amateur musicians that performs several classical and pops concerts annually.[54]\n\n\nBecause Salem is the state capital, it has a multitude of government agencies, departments, and boards housed in buildings with architectural designs ranging from the early 20th century to examples of state-of-the-art civil building design.\n\n\nThe historic Reed Opera House in downtown Salem has a number of local shops and dining establishments, as well as an art gallery.\n\n\nSalem has been awarded \"Tree City USA\" status by the National Arbor Day Foundation for 30 consecutive years for its dedication to urban forestry.[55] Salem was the first city in Oregon to receive the award.[56] In keeping with the city's \"Cherry City\" theme, flowering cherry trees have been planted along many Salem streets as well as on the Capitol Mall across from the Capitol.\n\n\nThe Salem Public Library's main branch is located just south of downtown. A branch library is located in West Salem (Polk County). The Library participates in the Chemeketa Cooperative Regional Library Service, so Salem Public Library cards are also valid in the member libraries in Yamhill, Polk, Marion, and parts of Linn County. In addition to the Salem Public Library, the Mark O. Hatfield Library at Willamette University is open to the public as well, although the hours are limited.\n\n\nThe film *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* was filmed at the Oregon State Hospital.\n\n\nSalem and its environs have a multitude of wineries and vineyards that are open to the public.[57]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Willson, and is the next oldest municipal park in Salem after Willson Park at the Oregon State Capitol.[64]\n\n\nAcross the Willamette River in West Salem is the 114-acre (46\u00a0ha) Wallace Marine Park, which includes a boat ramp and floating boat dock allowing easy access to the river for water sports. The NRHP-listed Union Street Railroad Bridge, repurposed as a bicycle and pedestrian bridge, connects Wallace Marine Park and West Salem to Riverfront Park and downtown Salem.\n\n\nSalem is also home to one of the smallest city parks in the world, Waldo Park, which consists of a single Sequoia tree.[65]\n\n\nThe capitol grounds, which are maintained by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, cover three city blocks and include Willson and Capitol parks.\n\n\n\n### Recreation[edit]\n\n\nOther large parks located in the Salem area include the 1,680-acre (680\u00a0ha) Willamette Mission State Park north of the city, and Silver Falls State Park east of Salem. Both of these parks have extensive hiking, biking, and horse trails.\n\n\nSalem's central location provides access to a wide variety of recreational activities in a variety of climates and geographies year round. The Coast Range and the Pacific Ocean are to the west. The Santiam Canyon area, the Western Cascades and the High Cascades are to the east. Portland and its environs are to the north, while Eugene and its environs are to the south.\n\n\nSalem also has two disc golf courses.

It serves primarily general aviation and the Oregon National Guard \u2013 Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF). Delta Connection offered commercial air service with two daily flights to Salt Lake City, Utah, from July 2007. However, citing fuel costs versus a load factor of less than 85 percent, the service was discontinued in October 2008. The city plans to go forward with airport improvements that were announced when service was commenced, including a longer runway and an expanded terminal building.[74] Avelo Airlines began service to Burbank, CA and Las Vegas, NV in early October 2023.\n\n\nThe city is served by the following highways:\n\n\n\n* Interstate 5\n* Oregon Route 99E\n\t+ Oregon Route 99E Business is a spur of the above, serving the downtown area\n* Oregon Route 22\n* Oregon Route 221\n* Oregon Route 51\n* Oregon Route 213\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nSalem Hospital Regional Health Services, one of the largest of Oregon's 57 acute care hospitals, is a 454-bed acute care medical facility.

Located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers in Northern California's Sacramento Valley, Sacramento's 2020 population of 524,943[7] makes it the fourth-most populous city in Northern California, sixth-most populous city in the state, and the ninth-most populous state capital in the United States.[9][10] Sacramento is the seat of the California Legislature and the Governor of California.\n\n\nSacramento is also the cultural and economic core of the Greater Sacramento area, which at the 2020 census had a population of 2,680,831,[8] the fourth-largest metropolitan area in California.[11]\n\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish, the area was inhabited by the Nisenan, Maidu, and other indigenous peoples of California. Spanish cavalryman Gabriel Moraga surveyed and named the *R\u00edo del Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento* (Sacramento River) in 1808, after the Blessed Sacrament. In 1839, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mexican governor of Alta California, granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to Swiss-born Mexican citizen John Augustus Sutter, who subsequently established Sutter's Fort and the settlement at the *Rancho Nueva Helvetia.* Following the American Conquest of California and the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento. In 1852, the city offered its county courthouse to the state of California to house the state legislature, resulting in the city becoming the permanent state capital in 1854 and ushering in the construction of a new state capitol building which was finished in 1874.[12]\n\n\nSacramento is the fastest-growing major city in California,[13] owing to its status as a notable political center on the West Coast and as a major educational hub, home of California State University, Sacramento and UC Davis. Similarly, Sacramento is a major center for the California healthcare industry, as the seat of Sutter Health, the world-renowned UC Davis Medical Center, and the UC Davis School of Medicine. In 2013, the Sacramento Convention and Visitors Bureau stated that the city receives 15.3 million visitors per year,[14] and is home to the California Museum, Crocker Art Museum, California State Railroad Museum, California State Capitol Museum, California Hall of Fame, and Old Sacramento State Historic Park. It is also a global city, designated at the Gamma \u2212 level.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Sacramento, California\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Sacramento, California.\n\n### Pre-Columbian period[edit]\n\n\nNisenan (Southern Maidu), Modoc, and Plains Miwok American Indians lived in the area for perhaps thousands of years. Until the settlers arrived who would eventually make Sacramento their home, these tribes left little evidence of their existence. Their diet was dominated by acorns taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region and by fruits, bulbs, seeds, and roots gathered throughout the year.\n\n\n\n### Spanish period[edit]\n\n\nIn 1808, the Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga encountered and named the Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento River. A Spanish writer with the Moraga expedition wrote:[16]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Canopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and (*the Spaniards)* drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them. \"\u00a1Es como el sagrado sacramento! (It's like the Blessed Sacrament.)\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe valley and the river were then christened after the \"Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ,\" referring to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\n\n\n### Mexican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1839, John Augustus Sutter established Sutter's Fort, which he called Nueva Helvetia. In 1841, he was officially granted the land by Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado.\nJohn Sutter Sr. first arrived in the area on August 13, 1839, at the divergence of the American and Sacramento Rivers with a Mexican land grant of 50,000 acres (20,000\u00a0ha). The next year, he and his party established Sutter's Fort, a massive adobe structure with walls 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) high and three feet (0.91\u00a0m) thick.[17]\n\n\nRepresenting Mexico, Sutter Sr. called his colony New Helvetia, a Swiss-inspired name, and was the political authority and dispenser of justice in the new settlement. Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a 10-acre (4.0\u00a0ha) orchard and a herd of 13,000 cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847, Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a sawmill so he could continue to expand his empire,[17] but unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.'s \"empire\" had been built on thin margins of credit.[18]\n\n\n\n### American period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sacramento in 1849, when the city was an economic center of the California Gold Rush\nIn 1848, when James W. Marshall discovered gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma (some 50\u00a0mi or 80.5\u00a0km northeast of the fort), numerous gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848, Sutter Sr.'s son, John Sutter Jr., arrived to assist his father in reducing his debt. The Sutters struggled to contain the effects of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many of whom squatted on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands or stole various unattended Sutter properties or belongings. For Sutter, his employee's discovery of gold in the area turned out to be a bane.\n\n\nBy December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with Sam Brannan, began laying out the City of Sacramento, 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) south of his father's settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., but the father, being deeply in debt, was unable to stop it. For commercial reasons, the new city was named \"Sacramento City\" after the Sacramento River. Sutter Jr. and Brannan had United States Army Captain William H. Warner assigned to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.) Relations between Sutter and his son became embittered after Sacramento became an overnight commercial success. (Sutter's Fort, Mill, and the town of Sutterville, all founded by John Sutter Sr., eventually failed).\n\n\n\n![](image)Old Sacramento, the oldest quarter of the city, grew up along the Sacramento River in the mid-1800s.\nResidents of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.[19]\n\n\nOn January 10, 1850, a flood occurred that devastated the city. The rushing waters uprooted homes and drowned livestock. The city was almost destroyed. Due to the efforts of Hardin Bigelow, Sacramento's first elected mayor, the construction of the city's first levee was completed in early 1852 (the city became known as \"The Levee City\"). However, a month after it was completed, it was breached during the first major storm of the season and the city flooded again. A new levee was built for $50,000, but it also broke, causing more flooding of the city.[20] Between October and December 1850, Sacramento was hit with a cholera epidemic that killed 1,000 residents, including Mayor Bigelow and 17 of the city's 40 physicians. Up to 80 percent of the populace left town.[21][22] On November 2, 1852, a fire known as the Great Conflagration burned more than 80 percent of the structures in the city. It is estimated that the total damage was around six million dollars. Within a month 761 structures were re-built, many of them in brick.[23] In spite of all these hardships the new city's location just downstream from the Mother Lode in the Sierra Nevada proved irresistible, and it grew rapidly during the early 1850s, attracting a population of 10,000. The Great Flood of 1862 from December 1861 to January 1862 caused the worst flooding in Sacramento's history. In 1861, Governor Leland Stanford, who was inaugurated in early January 1862, traveled to his inauguration in a rowboat.\n\n\n\n![](image)An 1874 depiction of a Sacramento railway station by painter William Hahn\nThe California State Legislature, with the support of Governor John Bigler, moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been Monterey, where, in 1849, the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. The convention decided San Jose would be the new state's capital. After 1850, when California's statehood was ratified, the legislature met in San Jose until 1851, Vallejo in 1852, and Benicia in 1853, before moving to Sacramento. During the 1850s the city was consolidated with the County of Sacramento.[24] In the Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879, Sacramento was named the permanent state capital.\n\n\nThe Classical Revival-style California State Capitol, similar to the national Capitol, was started in 1860 and completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session because of the massive flooding in Sacramento. From 1862 to 1868, part of the Leland Stanford Mansion was used for the governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869, while construction continued around them.\n\n\n\n![](image)The California State Capitol, built between 1860 and 1874, shown here under construction in 1868\nWith its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered. It was designated as the western terminus of the Pony Express. Later it became a terminus of the First transcontinental railroad, which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by \"The Big Four\"\u2014Mark Hopkins, Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers were key elements in the economic success of the city. Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic Sacramento Rail Yards.\n\n\nFrom 1862 until the mid-1870s, Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. The previous first floors of buildings became basements, with open space between the street and the building, previously the sidewalk, now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the \"Sacramento Underground\".\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Urban redevelopment in Sacramento, California\n\n![](image)Built in 1935, Tower Bridge connects Sacramento to West Sacramento.\nThe city's current charter was adopted by voters in 1920.[25] As a charter city, Sacramento is exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the state legislature. The city has expanded continuously over the years. The 1964 merger of the City of North Sacramento with Sacramento substantially increased its population, and large annexations of the Natomas area eventually led to significant population growth throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\n\nSacramento County (along with a portion of adjacent Placer County) is served by a customer-owned electric utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD in 1923.[26] In April 1946, after 12\u00a0years of litigation, a judge ordered Pacific Gas & Electric to transfer the title of Sacramento's electric distribution system to SMUD. Today SMUD is the sixth-largest public electric utility in the U.S. and is a leader in innovative programs and services, including the development of clean fuel resources, such as solar power.[27]\n\n\nThe year following the creation of SMUD, 1924, brought several events in Sacramento: Standard Oil executive Verne McGeorge established McGeorge School of Law, American department store Weinstock & Lubin opened a new store at 12th and K street, the US$2\u00a0million Senator Hotel was opened, Sacramento's drinking water became filtered and treated drinking water, and Sacramento boxer Georgie Lee fought Francisco Guilledo, a Filipino professional boxer known as Pancho Villa, at L Street Auditorium on March 21.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Elks Tower was built in 1926 in an Italianate style.\nEarly in World War II, the Sacramento Assembly Center (also known as the Walerga Assembly Center) was established to house Japanese Americans forcibly \"evacuated\" from the West Coast under Executive Order 9066. The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent War Relocation Authority camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the Tule Lake concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as Camp Kohler.\n\n\nAfter the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center. Camp Kohler was destroyed by a fire in December 1947, and the assembly center site is now part of the Foothill Farms-North Highlands subdivision.[29]\nThe Sacramento-Yolo Port District was created in 1947, and the ground was broken on the Port of Sacramento in 1949.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1975 assassination attempt of President Gerald Ford in Capitol Park\nOn June 29, 1963, with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor Vessel *Taipei Victory* arrived.[30] The Nationalist Chinese flagship docked at the Port of Sacramento, being the first ocean-going vessel in Sacramento since the steamship *Harpoon* in 1934.\n\n\nIn 1967, Ronald Reagan became the last Governor of California to live permanently in the city. The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: McClellan Air Force Base, Mather Air Force Base, and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood. Despite military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby San Francisco Bay Area, as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America.\n\n\nIn 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. In 1996, his death was attributed to the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski.\n\n\nAfter acquiring the majority stake in the Sacramento Kings, the team's new owner, Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, with the help of the city, agreed to build a new arena in the downtown area. With a final estimated cost of $558.2\u00a0million, Sacramento's Golden 1 Center opened on September 30, 2016.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city covers 100.1 square miles (259\u00a0km2). 97.81% of it is land, and 2.19% of it is water.\n\n\nDepth to groundwater is typically about 30 feet (9\u00a0m). Much of the land to the west of the city (in Yolo County) is permanently reserved for a vast flood control basin (the Yolo Bypass), due to the city's historical vulnerability to floods. As a result, the contiguous urban area sprawls only four miles (6.4\u00a0km) west of downtown (as West Sacramento, California) but 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northeast and east, into the Sierra Nevada foothills, and 10 miles (16\u00a0km) to the south into valley farmland.\n\n\nThe city is at the confluence of the Sacramento River and the American River and has a deep-water port connected to the San Francisco Bay by a channel through the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta. It is the shipping and rail center for the Sacramento Valley.[31]\n\n\n\n### Trees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Central Sacramento and the Sacramento RiverSacramento has long been known as the \"City of Trees\" owing to its abundant urban forest. The city has more trees per capita than anywhere else in the world.[32] The first recorded use of the term was in 1855, and it was popular by the early 20th century. It was not always so: it was at first called the \"City of Plains\" because of the lack of trees, but soon afterward there were cottonwood trees planted, and eucalyptus varieties were imported to dry out swampland. Later, locust trees, and willows were planted along streets, then elms, then palm trees, then fruit trees in the late 1910s.[33] It was the first US city to be designated a City of Trees by the Arbor Day Foundation in 1978.[34]\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, the tree cover is well above that of the average tree cover of other major cities in the United States and the rest of the world, with the main species being the London plane. Other species are being introduced to increase diversity and to help cope with the effects of climate change on vegetation in the future.[33] Treepedia, a project run by MIT using Google Maps' street-view data to calculate tree coverage in cities, ranked Sacramento the greenest city of 15 studied in the US, and third globally, after Vancouver and Singapore.[35]\n\n\nA prominent water tower bore the slogan \"City of Trees\" until 2017 when it was repainted with the words \"America's Farm-to-Fork Capital\" (referring to the farm-to-fork movement, which promotes the consumption of locally-grown food). After 4,000 displeased citizens signed a petition protesting the change, officials agreed to include both slogans on the water tower.[36]\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of downtown Sacramento from West Sacramento\n\n#### City neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Sacramento is the home of numerous corporate regional headquarters.\nThe city groups most of its neighborhoods into four areas:\n\n\n\n* Area One: Alkali Flat, Boulevard Park, Campus Commons, Sacramento State, Dos Rios Triangle, Downtown, East Sacramento, Mansion Flats, Marshall School, Midtown, New Era Park, McKinley Village, Newton Booth, Old Sacramento, Poverty Ridge, Richards, Richmond Grove, River Park, Elmhurst, Sierra Oaks, Southside Park.[37]\n* Area Two: Airport, Carleton Tract, Freeport Manor, Golf Course Terrace, Greenhaven, Curtis Park, Hollywood Park, Land Park, Little Pocket, Mangan Park, Meadowview, Parkway, Pocket, Sacramento City College, South Land Park, Valley Hi / North Laguna, Z'Berg Park.[38]\n* Area Three: Alhambra Triangle, Avondale, Brentwood, Carleton Tract, Colonial Heights, Colonial Manor, Curtis Park, Elmhurst, Fairgrounds, Florin, Fruitridge Manor, Glen Elder, Glenbrook, Granite Regional Park, Industrial Park, Lawrence Park, Med Center, North City Farms, Oak Park, Packard Bell, South City Farms, Southeast Village, Tahoe Park, Tahoe Park East, Tahoe Park South, Tallac Village, Vintage Park, Churchill Downs, and Woodbine.[39]\n* Area Four: Ben Ali, Del Paso Heights, Gardenland, Hagginwood, McClellan Heights West, Natomas (north, south, west), North Sacramento, Northgate, Robla, Swanston Estates, Terrace Manor, Valley View Acres, and Woodlake.[40]\n\n\n![](image)Old Sacramento and Downtown are seen from the Sacramento River.\nAdditional prominent regions and neighborhoods in the region include American River Parkway, Arden-Arcade, Arden Fair, Cal Expo, Capital Avenue, Coffing, College Glen, College Greens, Cordova, Creekside, East Fruitridge, Elder Creek, Elkhorn, Elvas, Erikson Industrial Park, Excelsior Sunrise, Foothill Farms, Franklin, Frates Ranch, Gateway Center, Gateway West, Glenwood Meadows, Hansen Park, Heritage Park, Johnson Business Park, Johnson Heights, Mayhew, Metro Center, Mills, Natomas Corporate Center, Natomas Creek, Natomas Crossing, Natomas Park, Newton Booth, Noralto, Northpointe, Norwood, Oak Knoll, Old North Sacramento, Parker Homes, Point West, Raley Industrial Park, Regency Park, Richardson Village, Richmond Grove, Rosemont, Sierra Oaks, Sports Complex, Strawberry Manor, Sundance Lake, Swanston Palms, Town and Country Village, Upper Land Park, Village 5, Village 7, Village 12, Village 14, Village Green, Walerga, Walsh Station, West Del Paso Heights, Westlake, Willowcreek, Wills Acres, Winn Park, Woodside, and Youngs Heights.[41][42]\n\n\n\n#### Notable areas[edit]\n\n\n##### Capitol Mall[edit]\n\n\nCapitol Mall connects West Sacramento and Downtown Sacramento. Some notable landmarks on this road include the Tower Bridge, Old Sacramento, and the California State Capitol Building. Capitol Mall is considered to be the business district of the city. Skyscrapers such as the Wells Fargo Center and U.S. Bank Tower, two of the tallest buildings in the city, are located on Capitol Mall and are home to several major companies. The street is also home to major festivals such as the annual Farm to Fork Festival.\n\n\n\n##### Downtown Commons[edit]\n\n\nOne of the newest districts in the city is Downtown Commons. Formerly home to the Downtown Plaza shopping mall, the district opened in 2016 along with the Golden 1 Center. Downtown Commons, otherwise known as DOCO, is home to the Sawyer, a 16-story skyscraper with a 250-room hotel and 45 condominiums, a Macy's anchor store, an IMAX theater, and retail space with a variety of restaurants and shops.[43]\n\n\n\n##### Downtown Sacramento[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Sacramento, clearly showing the downtown/midtown grid and surrounding areas\nSee also: Downtown Sacramento\n\nDowntown Sacramento is home to the SAFE Credit Union Convention Center and Theater, Sacramento City Hall, the Sacramento Public Library, and K Street, a historic street home to apartments, retail, and historical buildings. In addition, Downtown Sacramento is home to several hotels including the Citizen Hotel, housed in one of the first skyscrapers built in the city.[44]\n\n\n\n##### East Sacramento[edit]\n\n\nSee also: East Sacramento\n\nEast Sacramento is a neighborhood in between Midtown and Sacramento State. This neighborhood is well known for being home to McKinley Park and Rose Garden and the Fabulous Forties, home to some of the most expensive, largest, and architecturally unique homes in the city. East Sacramento was home to Ronald Reagan during his term as Governor of California and this neighborhood was prominently featured in Greta Gerwig's film Lady Bird.[45]\n\n\n\n##### Historic Chinatown[edit]\n\n\nThe Opium Wars of the 1840s and 1850s, along with the Gold Rush, brought many Chinese people to California. Most arrived at San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California and known as \"Daai Fau\" (Chinese: \u5927\u57e0; Jyutping: *daai6 fau6*; Cantonese Yale: *Daaihfauh*). Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called \"Yee Fow\" (Chinese: \u4e8c\u57e0; Jyutping: *ji6 fau6*). Today the city is known as \"\u8428\u514b\u62c9\u95e8\u6258\" (pinyin: *S\u00e0k\u00e8l\u0101m\u00e9ntu\u014d*) by Mainland Chinese and as \"\u6c99\u52a0\u7dec\u5ea6\" *S\u0101g\u0101m\u00edhndouh* and *Sh\u0101ji\u0101mi\u01cendu\u00f3* by Cantonese speakers and Taiwanese respectively.\n\n![](image)Sacramento's historic ChinatownS acramento's Chinatown was on \"I\" Street from Second to Sixth Streets, called the China Slough. At the time, this area of \"I\" Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who resented the Chinese working class.[46] Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as The Sacramento Union wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. While most of Sacramento's Chinatown has now been razed, a small Chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to the history of Sacramento's Chinatown.[47][48]\n\n\n##### Newton Booth Historic District[edit]\n\n\nThe Newton Booth Historic District, named for Newton Booth, is located on the southeast corner of Sacramento's original 1848 street grid.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\n\n##### Old Sacramento[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The historic Ebner's Hotel, built in 1856, in Old Sacramento\nThe oldest part of the town besides Sutter's Fort is Old Sacramento, which consists of cobbled streets and many historic buildings, several from the 1850s and 1860s. Buildings have been preserved, restored, or reconstructed, and the district is now a substantial tourist attraction, with rides on steam-powered historic trains and horse-drawn carriages.\n\n\n\n##### Poverty Ridge Historic District[edit]\n\n\nThe Poverty Ridge Historic District is within Sacramento's original 1848 street grid and bounded to the west by 21st Street, to the north by S Street, to the east by 23rd Street, to the south by W Street and U.S. Route 50, and includes the block bounded by 20th Street, 21st Street, S Street, and T Street.[53][54][55][56]\n\n\nThe Poverty Ridge Historic District was considered to be Sacramento's wealthiest\nneighborhood from 1868 to 1947.[53][57]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The American River is popular for kayaking and recreational boating.\nSacramento has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen *Csa*), characterized by hot, dry summers and cool winters with a decent amount of rainfall. The wet season is generally October through April, though there may be a day or two of light rainfall in June or September. The normal annual mean temperature is 61.8\u00a0\u00b0F (16.6\u00a0\u00b0C), with the monthly daily average temperature ranging from 47.3\u00a0\u00b0F (8.5\u00a0\u00b0C) in December to 75.9\u00a0\u00b0F (24.4\u00a0\u00b0C) in July.[58] Summer heat is sometimes moderated by a sea breeze known as the \"delta breeze\" which comes through the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta from the San Francisco Bay, and temperatures cool down sharply at night.\n\n\nThe foggiest months are December and January. Tule fog can be extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than 100 feet (30\u00a0m) and making driving conditions extremely hazardous. Chilling tule fog events have been known to last for several consecutive days or weeks. During Tule fog events, temperatures do not exceed 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n![](image)A market at C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Plaza\nSnowfall is rare in Sacramento, which is only 25\u00a0ft (8\u00a0m) above sea level. In the downtown area, only three significant snow accumulations have occurred since 1900, the last one being in 1976.[59] During especially cold winter and spring storms, intense showers do occasionally produce a significant amount of hail, which can create hazardous driving conditions. Snowfall in the city often melts upon ground contact, with traceable amounts occurring in some years. Significant annual snow accumulations occur in the foothills 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) east of the city, which had brief and traceable amounts of snowfall in January 2002, December 2009, and February 2011.[60][61] The greatest snowfall ever recorded in Sacramento was 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) on January 5, 1888.\nOn average, there are 76 days with a high of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C)+, and 14 days with a high of 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C)+; On the other extreme, there are 8.5 days where the temperature remains below 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C), and 15 freezing nights per year. Official temperature extremes range from 18\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127.8\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 22, 1990, to 116\u00a0\u00b0F (46.7\u00a0\u00b0C) on September 6, 2022;[62] a station around 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) east-southeast of the city dipped to 17\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22128.3\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 11, 1932.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of Downtown Sacramento\nThe average annual precipitation is 18.14 inches (461\u00a0mm). On average, precipitation falls on 58 days each year in Sacramento, and nearly all of this falls during the winter months. Average January rainfall is 3.66\u00a0in (93\u00a0mm), and measurable precipitation is rare during the summer months. In February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain, resulting in an accumulation of 6.41\u00a0in (163\u00a0mm) for the period. On rare occasions, monsoonal moisture surges from the Desert Southwest can bring upper-level moisture to the Sacramento region, leading to increased summer cloudiness, humidity, and even light showers and thunderstorms. Monsoon clouds do occur, usually during late July through early September. Sacramento is the second most flood-susceptible city in the United States after New Orleans.[64]\n\n\nSacramento has been noted as being the sunniest location on the planet for four months of the year, from May through August. It holds the distinction as the sunniest month, in terms of the percentage of possible sunshine, of anywhere in the world; July in Sacramento averages 14 hours and 12 minutes of sunshine per day, amounting to approximately 100% of possible sunshine.[65]\n\n\nSince 2010, statewide droughts in California have further strained Sacramento's water security.[66]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Sacramento,

It is the unincorporated county seat of the consolidated City and County of Honolulu, situated along the southeast coast of the island of O\u02bbahu,[a] and is the westernmost and southernmost major U.S. city. Honolulu is Hawaii's main gateway to the world. It is also a major hub for business, finance, hospitality, and military defense in both the state and Oceania. The city is characterized by a mix of various Asian, Western, and Pacific cultures, reflected in its diverse demography, cuisine, and traditions.\n\n\n*Honolulu* means \"sheltered harbor\"[9] or \"calm port\" in Hawaiian;[10] its old name, ***Kou***, roughly encompasses the area from Nu\u02bbuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street, which is the heart of the present downtown district.[11] The city's desirability as a port accounts for its historical growth and importance in the Hawaiian archipelago and the broader Pacific region. Honolulu has been the capital of the Hawaiian Islands since 1845, firstly of the independent Hawaiian Kingdom, and since 1898 of the U.S. territory and state of Hawaii. The city gained worldwide recognition following the Empire of Japan's attack on nearby Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which prompted the entry of the U.S. into World War II; the harbor remains a major U.S. Navy base, hosting the United States Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command.[12]\n\n\nHawaii is the only state with no incorporated places below the county level.[13] The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as the \"City of Honolulu\" as a census county division (CCD).[14] As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the population of Honolulu was 350,964,[15] while that of the urban Honolulu census-designated place (CDP) was 802,459. The Urban Honolulu Metropolitan Statistical Area had 1,016,508 residents in 2020.[5] With over 300,000 residents, Honolulu is the most populous Oceanian city outside Australasia.[16][17]\n\n\nHonolulu's favorable tropical climate, rich natural scenery, and extensive beaches make it a popular global destination for tourists. With over 2.7 million visitors as of 2019, Honolulu is the seventh-most visited city in the United States after New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Orlando, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Honolulu.\n\n![](image)Port of Honolulu, as seen by German-Russian artist Louis Choris in 1816\n![](image)*Queen Street, Honolulu*, 1856, by George Henry Burgess\n![people in street watching fire in distance](image)The Great Chinatown Fire\n\nEvidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original Polynesian migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century.[19][*unreliable source?*] After Kamehameha I conquered O\u02bbahu in the Battle of Nu\u02bbuanu at Nu\u02bbuanu Pali, he moved his royal court from the Island of Hawai\u02bbi to Waik\u012bk\u012b in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now downtown Honolulu. The capital was moved back to Kailua-Kona in 1812.\n\n\nIn November 1794, Captain William Brown of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor.[20] More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia. The settlement grew from a handful of homes to a city in the early 19th century after Kamehameha I chose it as a replacement for his residence at Waikiki in 1810.[21]\n\n\nIn 1850, Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu.[21] He and the kings who followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital, erecting buildings such as St. Andrew's Cathedral, \u02bbIolani Palace, and Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale. At the same time, Honolulu became the islands' center of commerce, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses downtown.[22]\n\n\nDespite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century\u2014such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Hawai\u02bbi's annexation by the U.S. in 1898, a large fire in 1900, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941\u2014Honolulu remained the Hawaiian Islands' capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)A view of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 from Japanese planes. The torpedo explosion in the center is on the USS *West Virginia*.\nAn economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawai\u02bbi. Modern air travel brings, as of 2007[update], 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at Honolulu International Airport.[24] Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waik\u012bk\u012b is the center of the tourism industry in Hawai\u02bbi, with thousands of hotel rooms.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astronaut photograph of western Honolulu, HNL Airport, and Pearl Harbor taken from the International Space Station\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the Urban Honolulu CDP has an area of 68.4 square miles (177.2\u00a0km2), of which 7.9 square miles (20.5\u00a0km2), or 11.56%, is water.[25]\n\n\nHonolulu is the remotest major U.S. city and one of the remotest in the world.[26] The closest location in mainland U.S. is the Point Arena Lighthouse in northern California, at 2,045 nautical miles (3,787\u00a0km).[27] (Nautical vessels require some additional distance to circumnavigate Makapu\u02bbu Point.) The closest major city is San Francisco, California, at 2,397 miles (3,858\u00a0km).[26] Some islands off the Mexican coast and part of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.\n\n\nThe volcanic field of the Honolulu Volcanics is partially inside the city.[28]\n\n\n\n### Neighborhoods, boroughs, and districts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honolulu as seen from the International Space Station\n![](image)Downtown at Bishop and King streets, with First Hawaiian Center (left) and Bank of Hawaii Center (right)\n* Downtown Honolulu is Hawaii's financial, commercial, and governmental center. On the waterfront is Aloha Tower, for many years Hawai\u02bbi's tallest building. The tallest building is now the 438-foot (134\u00a0m) First Hawaiian Center, on King and Bishop Streets. The downtown campus of Hawai\u02bbi Pacific University is also there.\n* The Arts District Honolulu, both downtown and in Chinatown, is on Chinatown's eastern edge. It is a 12-block area bounded by Bethel & Smith Streets and Nimitz Highway and Beretania Street\u2014home to numerous arts and cultural institutions. It is within the Chinatown Historic District, which includes the former Hotel Street Vice District.[29]\n* The Capitol District is the eastern part of Downtown Honolulu. It is the current and historic center of Hawai\u02bbi's state government, incorporating the State Capitol, \u02bbIolani Palace, Honolulu Hale (City Hall), State Library, and the statue of King Kamehameha I, along with numerous government buildings.\n* Kaka\u02bbako is a light-industrial district between Downtown and Waik\u012bk\u012b that has seen a large-scale redevelopment effort in the past decade. It is home to two major shopping areas, Ward Warehouse and Ward Center. The Howard Hughes Corporation plans to transform Ward Centers into Ward Village over the next decade. The John A. Burns School of Medicine, part of the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, is also there. A memorial to the *Ehime Maru* Incident victims is at the Kaka\u02bbako Waterfront Park.\n* Ala Moana is a district between Kaka\u02bbako and Waik\u012bk\u012b and the home of Ala Moana Center, the \"world's largest open-air shopping center\" and Hawai\u02bbi's largest shopping mall.[30] Ala Moana Center has over 300 tenants and is very popular with tourists. Also in Ala Moana is the Honolulu Design Center and Ala Moana Beach Park, Honolulu's second-largest park.\n* Waik\u012bk\u012b is Honolulu's tourist district, between the Ala Wai Canal and the Pacific Ocean next to Diamond Head. Numerous hotels, shops, and nightlife opportunities are along Kal\u0101kaua and K\u016bhi\u014d Avenues. It is a popular location for visitors and locals alike and attracts millions of visitors every year. Most of O\u02bbahu's hotel rooms are in Waik\u012bk\u012b.\n* M\u0101noa, M\u014d\u02bbili\u02bbili, and Makiki are residential neighborhoods in adjacent areas just inland of downtown and Waik\u012bk\u012b. M\u0101noa Valley is home to the main campus of the University of Hawai\u02bbi.\n* Nu\u02bbuanu and Pauoa are upper-middle-class residential districts inland of downtown Honolulu. The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific is in Punchbowl Crater, fronting Pauoa Valley.\n* P\u0101lolo and Kaimuk\u012b are neighborhoods east of M\u0101noa and Makiki, inland from Diamond Head. P\u0101lolo Valley parallels M\u0101noa and is a residential neighborhood. Kaimuk\u012b is primarily a residential neighborhood with a commercial strip centered on Wai\u02bbalae Avenue running behind Diamond Head. Chaminade University is in Kaimuk\u012b.\n* Wai\u02bbalae and K\u0101hala are upper-class districts of Honolulu directly east of Diamond Head, with many high-priced homes. Also in these neighborhoods are the Waialae Country Club and the five-star Kahala Hotel & Resort.\n* East Honolulu includes the residential communities of \u02bb\u0100ina Haina, Niu Valley, and Hawai\u02bbi Kai. These are considered upper-middle-class neighborhoods. The upscale gated communities of Wai\u02bbalae \u02bbIki and Hawai\u02bbi Loa Ridge are also there.\n* Kalihi and P\u0101lama are working-class neighborhoods with a number of government housing developments. Lower Kalihi, toward the ocean, is a light-industrial district.\n* Salt Lake and \u0100liamanu are (mostly) residential areas built in extinct tuff cones along the western end of the Honolulu District, not far from Honolulu International Airport.\n* Moanalua is two neighborhoods and a valley at the western end of Honolulu, and home to Tripler Army Medical Center.\n* Kamehameha Heights is a northern suburb.[31]\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nHonolulu experiences a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen classification *BSh*), with a mostly dry summer season, due to a rain shadow effect.[32] Despite temperatures that meet the tropical threshold of all months having a mean temperature of 64.4\u00a0\u00b0F (18.0\u00a0\u00b0C) or higher, the city receives too little precipitation to be classified as tropical. Temperatures vary little throughout the year, with average high temperatures of 80\u201390\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C) and average lows of 65\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C). Temperatures reach or exceed 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on an average of only 32 days annually,[33][b] with lows in the upper 50s \u00b0F (14\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C) once or twice a year. The highest recorded temperature was 95\u00a0\u00b0F (35\u00a0\u00b0C) on September 19, 1994, and August 31, 2019.[33] The lowest recorded temperature was 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 16, 1902, and January 20, 1969.[33]\n\n\nThe annual average rainfall is 16.41 inches (417 millimeters),[33] which mainly occurs from October through early April, with very little rainfall in the summer. However, both seasons experience a similar number of rainy days. Light showers occur in summer, while heavier rain falls during winter. Honolulu has an average of 278 sunny days and 89.2 rainy days per year.\n\n\nAlthough the city is in the tropics, hurricanes are quite rare. The last recorded hurricane that hit near Honolulu was Category 4 Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Tornadoes are also uncommon and usually strike every 15 years. Waterspouts off the coast are also uncommon, hitting about every five years.[34]\n\n\nHonolulu falls under the USDA 12b Plant Hardiness zone.[35]\n\n\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from 75.7\u00a0\u00b0F (24.3\u00a0\u00b0C) in March to 80.4\u00a0\u00b0F (26.9\u00a0\u00b0C) in September.[36]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Honolulu International Airport (1991\u22122020 normals,[c] extremes 1877\u2212present[d])\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 88(31)\n | 88(31)\n | 89(32)\n | 91(33)\n | 93(34)\n | 92(33)\n | 94(34)\n | 95(35)\n | 95(35)\n | 94(34)\n | 93(34)\n | 89(32)\n | 95(35)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 84.0(28.9)\n | 84.6(29.2)\n | 85.0(29.4)\n | 86.4(30.2)\n | 88.5(31.4)\n | 89.1(31.7)\n | 90.4(32.4)\n | 91.1(32.8)\n | 91.2(32.9)\n | 90.1(32.3)\n | 87.3(30.7)\n | 85.1(29.5)\n | 91.7(33.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 80.5(26.9)\n | 80.5(26.9)\n | 81.2(27.3)\n | 83.1(28.4)\n | 84.8(29.3)\n | 86.9(30.5)\n | 88.1(31.2)\n | 88.8(31.6)\n | 88.4(31.3)\n | 86.9(30.5)\n | 84.1(28.9)\n | 81.8(27.7)\n | 84.6(29.2)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 73.6(23.1)\n | 73.8(23.2)\n | 74.7(23.7)\n | 76.6(24.8)\n | 78.2(25.7)\n | 80.3(26.8)\n | 81.6(27.6)\n | 82.2(27.9)\n | 81.6(27.6)\n | 80.4(26.9)\n | 78.0(25.6)\n | 75.5(24.2)\n | 78.0(25.6)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 66.8(19.3)\n | 67.1(19.5)\n | 68.1(20.1)\n | 70.1(21.2)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n | 73.8(23.2)\n | 75.1(23.9)\n | 75.6(24.2)\n | 74.8(23.8)\n | 73.9(23.3)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 69.2(20.7)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 60.0(15.6)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 62.1(16.7)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 70.1(21.2)\n | 71.6(22.0)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 70.6(21.4)\n | 69.0(20.6)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 63.1(17.3)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 52(11)\n | 52(11)\n | 53(12)\n | 56(13)\n | 60(16)\n | 63(17)\n | 63(17)\n | 63(17)\n | 64(18)\n | 61(16)\n | 57(14)\n | 54(12)\n | 52(11)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.84(47)\n | 1.94(49)\n | 2.36(60)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.82(21)\n | 0.50(13)\n | 0.52(13)\n | 0.84(21)\n | 0.88(22)\n | 1.51(38)\n | 2.25(57)\n | 2.18(55)\n | 16.41(417)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 7.7\n | 7.6\n | 8.7\n | 7.5\n | 6.0\n | 6.3\n | 7.3\n | 5.7\n | 7.2\n | 7.7\n | 8.6\n | 8.9\n | 89.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 73.3\n | 70.8\n | 68.8\n | 67.3\n | 66.1\n | 64.4\n | 64.6\n | 64.1\n | 65.5\n | 67.5\n | 70.4\n | 72.4\n | 67.9\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 213.5\n | 212.7\n | 259.2\n | 251.8\n | 280.6\n | 286.1\n | 306.2\n | 303.1\n | 278.8\n | 244.0\n | 200.4\n | 199.5\n | 3,035.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 63\n | 66\n | 69\n | 66\n | 69\n | 71\n | 74\n | 76\n | 76\n | 68\n | 60\n | 59\n | 68\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 6.8\n | 8.5\n | 10.2\n | 11.2\n | 11.6\n | 11.8\n | 12.2\n | 12.2\n | 11.1\n | 8.9\n | 6.8\n | 6.0\n | 9.7\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity and sun 1961\u20131990)[33][37][38] |\n| Source 2: UV Index Today (1995 to 2022)[39] |\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Honolulu\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 76.5(24.7)\n | 75.9(24.4)\n | 75.7(24.3)\n | 76.9(25.0)\n | 77.9(25.5)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 78.9(26.0)\n | 79.5(26.4)\n | 80.4(26.9)\n | 79.8(26.5)\n | 78.5(25.9)\n | 77.0(25.0)\n | 78.0(25.5)\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours\n | 11.0\n | 11.0\n | 12.0\n | 13.0\n | 13.0\n | 13.0\n | 13.0\n | 13.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 11.0\n | 11.0\n | 12.1\n |\n| Average Ultraviolet index | 7\n | 9\n | 11\n | 11\n | 11\n | 11+\n | 11+\n | 11+\n | 11\n | 9\n | 7\n | 6\n | 9.6\n |\n| Source #1: seatemperature.org[40] |\n| Source #2: Weather Atlas[41] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The population of East Honolulu was 50,922 as of 2020, increasing Honolulu's core population to over 400,000.[43]\n\n\nIn terms of race and ethnicity, 54.8% were Asian, 17.9% were White, 1.5% were Black or African American, 0.2% were Native American or Alaska Native, 8.4% were Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 0.8% were from \"some other race\", and 16.3% were from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 5.4% of the population.[15] In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Honolulu's population as 33.9% white and 53.7% Asian and Pacific Islander.[44]\n\n\nAsian Americans are the majority of Honolulu's population. The Asian ethnic groups are Japanese (19.9%), Filipinos (13.2%), Chinese (10.4%), Koreans (4.3%), Vietnamese (2.0%), Indians (0.3%), Laotians (0.3%), Thais (0.2%), Cambodians (0.1%), and Indonesians (0.1%).\n\n\nPacific Islander Americans are 8.4% of Honolulu's population. The Pacific Islander ethnic groups are people solely of Native Hawaiian ancestry (3.2%), Samoan Americans made up 1.5% of the population, Marshallese people make up 0.5%, and Tongan people comprise 0.3%. People of Guamanian or Chamorro descent made up 0.2% of the population and numbered 841.[15]\n\n\nMetropolitan Honolulu, which encompasses all of Oahu island, had a population of 953,207 as of the 2010 U.S. Census and 1,016,508 in the 2020 U.S. Census, making it the 54th-largest metropolitan area in the United States.[45][46]\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honolulu viewed from Diamond Head crater\nThe largest city and airport in the Hawaiian Islands, Honolulu acts as a natural gateway to the islands' large tourism industry, which brings millions of visitors and contributes $10 billion annually to the local economy. Honolulu's location in the Pacific also makes it a large business and trading hub, particularly between the East and the West. Other important aspects of the city's economy include military defense, research and development, and manufacturing.[47]\n\n\nAmong the companies based in Honolulu are:\n\n\n\n* Alexander & Baldwin\n* Bank of Hawaii\n* Central Pacific Bank\n* First Hawaiian Bank\n* Hawaii Medical Service Association\n* Hawaii Pacific Health\n* Hawaiian Electric Industries\n* Matson Navigation Company\n* The Queen's Health Systems\n\nHawaiian Airlines,[48] Island Air,[49] and Aloha Air Cargo are headquartered in the city.[50][51] Until it dissolved, Aloha Airlines was headquartered in the city.[52] At one time Mid-Pacific Airlines had its headquarters on the property of Honolulu International Airport.[53]\n\n\nIn 2009, Honolulu had a 4.5% increase in average rent, maintaining it in the second most expensive rental market among 210 U.S. metropolitan areas.[54] Similarly, the general cost of living, including gasoline, electricity, and most foodstuffs, is much higher than on the U.S. mainland, because the city and state have to import most goods.[26] One 2014 report found that cost of living expenses were 69% higher than the U.S. average.[55]\n\n\nSince the only national banks in Hawai\u02bbi are all local, many visitors and new residents must get accustomed to different banks. First Hawaiian Bank is Hawaii's largest and oldest bank,[56] headquartered at the First Hawaiian Center, the state's tallest office building.[57]\n\n\n\n## Cultural institutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With symbolic native-styled architectural features, First Hawaiian Center is the tallest office building in Hawai\u02bbi and home to a Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House gallery.\n### Natural museums[edit]\n\n\nThe Bishop Museum is Honolulu's largest museum. It has the state's largest collection of natural history specimens and the world's largest collection of Hawaiiana and Pacific culture artifacts.[58] The Honolulu Zoo is Hawaii's main zoological institution, while the Waik\u012bk\u012b Aquarium is a working marine biology laboratory. The Waik\u012bk\u012b Aquarium partners with the University of Hawai\u02bbi and other universities worldwide. Established for appreciation and botany, Honolulu is home to several gardens: Foster Botanical Garden, Lili\u02bbuokalani Botanical Garden, Walker Estate, among others.\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1900, the Honolulu Symphony is the second-oldest U.S. symphony orchestra west of the Rocky Mountains. Other classical music ensembles include the Hawaii Opera Theatre. Honolulu is also a center for Hawaiian music. The main music venues include the Hawaii Theatre, the Neal Blaisdell Center Concert Hall and Arena, and the Waik\u012bk\u012b Shell.\n\n\nHonolulu also includes several venues for live theater, including the Diamond Head Theatre and Kumu Kahua Theatre.\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nVarious institutions for the visual arts are in Honolulu.\n\n\nThe Honolulu Museum of Art has Hawai\u02bbi's largest collection of Asian and Western art. It also has the largest collection of Islamic art, housed at the Shangri La estate. Since the merger of the Honolulu Academy of Arts and The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu (now called the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House) in 2011, the museum is also the state's only contemporary art museum. The contemporary collections are housed at main campus (Spalding House) in Makiki and a multi-level gallery in downtown Honolulu at the First Hawaiian Center. The museum hosts a film and video program dedicated to arthouse and world cinema in the museum's Doris Duke Theatre, named for the museum's historic patroness Doris Duke.[59]\n\n\nThe Hawaii State Art Museum (also downtown) has pieces by local artists as well as traditional Hawaiian art. The museum is administered by the Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Diamond Head\nHonolulu also annually holds the Hawaii International Film Festival (HIFF). It showcases some of the best films from producers all across the Pacific Rim and is the largest \"East meets West\" style film festival of its sort in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Tourist attractions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diamond Head and Honolulu viewed from Round Top Drive\n* Ala Moana Center\n* Aloha Tower\n* Bishop Museum\n* Diamond Head\n* Hanauma Bay\n* Honolulu Museum of Art\n* Honolulu Zoo\n* \u02bbIolani Palace\n* Lyon Arboretum\n* National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific\n* USS Arizona Memorial\n* Waik\u012bk\u012b Aquarium\n* Waikiki Beach\n* Waikiki Trolley\n* International Market Place\n* Kapi'olani Park\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nHonolulu's tropical climate lends itself to year-round activities. In 2004, *Men's Fitness* magazine named Honolulu the fittest city in the United States.[60] Honolulu has three large road races:\n\n\n\n* The Great Aloha Run is held annually on Presidents' Day.\n* The Honolulu Marathon, held annually on the second Sunday in December, draws more than 20,000 participants each year, about half to two thirds of them from Japan.\n* The Honolulu Triathlon is an Olympic distance triathlon event governed by USA Triathlon and partly by the Japanese. Held annually in May since 2004, there is an absence of a sprint course.\n\n\nIronman Hawaii was first held in Honolulu. It was the first ever Ironman triathlon event and is also the world championship.\n\n\nThe Waikiki Roughwater Swim race is held annually off the beach of Waikiki. Founded by Jim Cotton in 1970, the course is 2.384 miles (3.837\u00a0km) and spans from the New Otani Hotel to the Hilton Rainbow Tower.[61]\n\n\nFans of spectator sports in Honolulu generally support the football, volleyball, basketball, rugby union, rugby league, and baseball programs of the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa.[62] High school sporting events, especially football, are especially popular.\n\n\nHonolulu has no professional sports teams, with any prospective teams being forced to conduct extremely long travels for away games in the continental states. It was the home of the Hawaii Islanders (Pacific Coast League, 1961\u201387), The Hawaiians (World Football League, 1974\u201375), Team Hawaii (North American Soccer League, 1977), and the Hawaiian Islanders (af2, 2002\u201304).\n\n\nThe NCAA football Hawaii Bowl is played in Honolulu. Honolulu also hosted the NFL's annual Pro Bowl each February from 1980 to 2009. After the 2010 and 2015 games were played in Miami Gardens and Glendale, respectively, the Pro Bowl was once again in Honolulu from 2011 to 2014, with 2016 the most recent.[63][64] From 1993 to 2008, Honolulu hosted Hawaii Winter Baseball, featuring minor-league players from Major League Baseball, Nippon Professional Baseball, Korea Baseball Organization, and independent leagues.\n\n\nIn 2018, the Honolulu Little League team qualified for that year's Little League World Series tournament. The team went undefeated en route to the United States championship game, where it bested Georgia's Peachtree City American Little League team 3\u20130. In the world championship game, the team faced off against South Korea's South Seoul Little League team. Hawaii pitcher Ka'olu Holt threw a complete-game shutout while striking out 8, and Honolulu Little League, again by a score of 3\u20130, secured the victory, capturing the 2018 Little League World Series championship and Hawaii's third overall title at the Little League World Series.[65]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nVenues for spectator sports in Honolulu include:\n\n\n\n* Les Murakami Stadium at University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa (baseball)\n* Neal S. Blaisdell Center Arena (basketball)\n* Stan Sheriff Center at University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa (basketball and volleyball)\n\n\nAloha Stadium was a venue for American football and soccer located in Halawa near Pearl Harbor, just outside Honolulu.[66] The stadium was closed in 2020.[67] Plans for a new stadium at the site were announced in 2022.[68]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Completed in 1928, Honolulu Hale is the city and county seat.\nRick Blangiardi was elected mayor of Honolulu County on August 8, 2020, and began serving as the county's 15th mayor on January 2, 2021. The municipal offices of the City and County of Honolulu, including Honolulu Hale, the seat of the city and county, are in the Capitol District, as are the Hawaii state government buildings.[69]\n\n\nThe Capitol District is in the Honolulu census county division (CCD), the urban area commonly regarded as the \"City\" of Honolulu. The Honolulu CCD is on the southeast coast of O\u02bbahu between Makapuu and Halawa. The division boundary follows the Ko\u02bbolau crestline, so Makapu\u02bbu Beach is in the Ko'olaupoko District. On the west, the division boundary follows Halawa Stream, then crosses Red Hill and runs just west of Aliamanu Crater, so that Aloha Stadium, Pearl Harbor (with the USS Arizona Memorial), and Hickam Air Force Base are all in the island's Ewa CCD.[70]\n\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Public Safety operates the O\u02bbahu Community Correctional Center, the jail for the island of O\u02bbahu, in Honolulu CCD.[71]\n\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates post offices in Honolulu. The main Honolulu Post Office is by the international airport, at 3600 Aolele Street.[72] Federal Detention Center, Honolulu, operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, is in the CDP.[73]\n\n\n\n### Foreign missions on the island[edit]\n\n\nSeveral countries have consular facilities in Honolulu. They include consulates of Japan,[74] South Korea,[75] Philippines,[76] Taiwan,[77] Federated States of Micronesia,[78] Australia,[79] and the Marshall Islands.[80]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Hawaii\n\nColleges and universities in Honolulu include Honolulu Community College, Kapiolani Community College, the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, Chaminade University, and Hawaii Pacific University.[51] University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa houses the main offices of the University of Hawai\u02bbi System.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research institutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pacific Forum, one of the world's leading Asia-Pacific policy research institutes, is on Bishop Street.\nHonolulu is home to three renowned international affairs research institutions. The Pacific Forum, one of the world's leading Asia-Pacific policy research institutes and one of the first U.S. organizations to focus exclusively on Asia, has its main office on Bishop Street in downtown Honolulu. The East\u2013West Center (EWC), an education and research organization established by Congress in 1960 to strengthen relations and understanding among the peoples and nations of Asia, the Pacific, and the U.S., is headquartered in M\u0101noa, Honolulu. The Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS), a U.S. Department of Defense institute, is based in Waik\u012bk\u012b, Honolulu. APCSS addresses regional and global security issues and supports the U.S. Pacific Command by developing and sustaining relationships among security practitioners and national security establishments throughout the region.\n\n\n\n### Public primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queen Liliuokalani Building, Hawaii Department of Education headquarters in Honolulu CDP\nHawaii Department of Education operates Honolulu's public schools.[82] Public high schools in the CDP area include Wallace Rider Farrington, Kaiser, Kaimuki, Kalani, Moanalua, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.[51] It also includes the Hawaii School for the Deaf and the Blind, the statewide school for blind and deaf children. There is a charter school, University Laboratory School.\n\n\n\n### Private primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update] almost 38% of K-12 students in the Honolulu area attend private schools.[83]\n\n\nPrivate schools include Academy of the Pacific, Damien Memorial School, Hawaii Baptist Academy, \u02bbIolani School, Lutheran High School of Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, Maryknoll School, Mid-Pacific Institute, La Pietra, Punahou School, Sacred Hearts Academy, St. Andrew's Priory School, Saint Francis School, Saint Louis School, the Education Laboratory School, Saint Patrick School, Trinity Christian School, and Varsity International School. Hawaii has one of the nation's highest rate of private school attendance.[84]\n\n\n\n### Public libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hawaii State Library\nHawaii State Public Library System operates public libraries. The Hawaii State Library in the CDP serves as the system's main library,[85] while the Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, also in the CDP area, serves handicapped and blind people.[86]\n\n\nBranches in the CDP area include Aiea, Aina Haina, Ewa Beach, Hawai\u02bbi Kai, Kahuku, Kailua, Kaimuki, Kalihi-Palama, Kaneohe, Kapolei, Liliha, M\u0101noa, McCully-Moiliili, Mililani, Moanalua, Wahiawa, Waialua, Waianae, Waik\u012bk\u012b-Kapahulu, Waimanalo, and Waipahu.[87]\n\n\n\n### Weekend educational programs[edit]\n\n\nThe Hawai\u02bbi Japanese School \u2013 Rainbow Gakuen (\u30cf\u30ef\u30a4\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u5b66\u5712 *Hawai Reinb\u014d Gakuen*), a supplementary weekend Japanese school, holds its classes in Kaimuki Middle School in Honolulu and has its offices in another building in Honolulu.[88] The school serves overseas Japanese nationals.[89] Honolulu has other weekend programs for the Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish languages.[90]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Honolulu\n\nHonolulu is served by one daily newspaper, the *Honolulu Star-Advertiser,* along with a magazine, *Honolulu Magazine*, several radio stations and television stations, among other media. Local news agency and CNN-affiliate Hawaii News Now broadcasts and is headquartered out of Honolulu.\n\n\nHonolulu and the island of O\u02bbahu has also been the location for many film and television projects, including *Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)*, *Magnum, P.I.* and *Lost*.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honolulu International Airport old control tower\n![](image)8R \"Reef Runway\" of Honolulu International Airport\n![](image)Aerial view of H-1 (looking east) from Honolulu Airport heading into downtown Honolulu\nAt the western end of the CDP, Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) is the principal aviation gateway to the state of Hawaii. Kalaeloa Airport is primarily a commuter facility used by unscheduled air taxis, general aviation and transient and locally based military aircraft.\n\n\n\n### Highways[edit]\n\n\nHonolulu has been ranked as having the nation's worst traffic congestion, beating former record holder Los Angeles. Drivers waste on average over 58 hours per year on congested roadways.[91] The following freeways, part of the Interstate Highway System serve Honolulu:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Interstate H-1, western terminous is at Kapolei where you can connect to the Farrington Highway. The H-1 passes Hickam Air Force Base and Honolulu International Airport, runs through pearl city before heading downtown into Honolulu continues eastward through Makiki and Kaimuki, ending at Waialae/Kahala and start of the Kalanianole Highway.\n* ![](image) Interstate H-201\u2014also known as the Moanalua Freeway and sometimes numbered as its former number, Hawai\u02bbi State Route 78\u2014connects two points along H-1: at Aloha Stadium and Fort Shafter. Close to H-1 and Aloha Stadium, H-201 has an exchange with the western terminus of Interstate H-3 to the windward side of Oahu (Kaneohe). This complex of connecting ramps, some directly between H-1 and H-3, is in Halawa.\n* ![](image) Interstate H-2 Connects at a junction near Waipau and Pearl City with the H-1 freeway. The H-2 freeway will take you up to Schofield barracks before ending at Wahiawa where it connect to the north shore.\n* ![](image) Interstate H-3 Connects at a junction near Halawa Heights. This interstate highway will take you from Halawa heights through the Ko'olau Range to Kaneohe. Its final termination is at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. Exit 15 is the last exit before entering Marine Corps Base Hawaii.\n\n\nOther major highways that link Honolulu CCD with other parts of the Island of Oahu are:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Pali Highway, State Route 61, crosses north over the Ko\u02bbolau range via the Pali Tunnels to connect to Kailua and Kaneohe on the windward side of the Island.\n* ![](image) Likelike Highway, State Route 63, also crosses the Ko\u02bbolau to Kaneohe via the Wilson Tunnels.\n* ![](image) Kalanianaole Highway, State Route 72, runs eastward from Waialae/Kahala to Hawai\u02bbi Kai and around the east end of the island to Waimanalo Beach.\n* Kamehameha Highway, State Route 80, 83, 99 and 830, runs westward from near Hickam Air Force Base to Aiea and beyond, eventually running through the center of the island and ending in Kaneohe.\n* Farrington Highway, State Route 93 runs western leeward Oahu from Kaena Point through Waianae and Makaha before the start of the H-1. State Rte 930 starts east to west in the north shore connecting you from Wailua to Kaena Point\n\n\nLike most major American cities, the Honolulu metropolitan area experiences heavy traffic congestion during rush hours, especially to and from the western suburbs of Kapolei, \u02bbEwa Beach, Aiea, Pearl City, Waipahu, and Mililani.\n\n\nThere is a Hawai\u02bbi Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP).[92]\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n#### Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, voters approved a charter amendment to create a public transit authority to oversee the planning, construction, operation and future extensions to Honolulu's rail system, now known as Skyline. The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) has a 10-member board of directors, with three members appointed by the mayor, three selected by the Honolulu City Council, and the city and state transportation directors.[93]\n\n\nThe opening of the first phase of the Skyline was delayed until 2023, as HART canceled the initial bids for the first nine stations, rebid the work as three packages of three stations each, and allowed more time for construction in the hope that increased competition on smaller contracts would drive down costs;[94] initial bids ranged from $294.5\u00a0million to $320.8\u00a0million, far surpassing HART's budget of $184\u00a0million.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: TheBus (Honolulu)\n\nEstablished by former Mayor Frank F. Fasi as the replacement for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (HRT), Honolulu's TheBus system was honored in 1994\u201395 and 2000\u201301 by the American Public Transportation Association as \"America's Best Transit System\". TheBus operates 107 routes serving Honolulu and most major cities and towns on O\u02bbahu. TheBus comprises a fleet of 531 buses, and is run by the nonprofit corporation O\u02bbahu Transit Services in conjunction with the city Department of Transportation Services. As of 2006[update], Honolulu was ranked fourth for highest per-capita use of mass transit in the United States.[96]\n\n\n**Para-transit Options**\n\n\nThe island also features TheHandi-Van,[97] for riders who require para-transit operations. To be eligible for this service, riders must meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). TheHandi-Van has a fare of $2 and is available from 4am to 1am. There is a 24-hour service within 3/4 of a mile of TheBus route 2[98] and route 40.[99] TheHandi-Van comprises a fleet of 160 buses. The parantransit branch also runs Human Services Transportation Coordination (HSTCP), which mainly provides transportation for people with disabilities, older adults, and people with limited incomes, assisted by the Committee for Accessible Transportation (CAT). Both organizations work together to provide transportation for elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Skyline (Honolulu)\n\nHonolulu has no urban rail transit system, though electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company before World War II. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).[100]\n\n\nThe City and County of Honolulu is constructing a 20-mile (32\u00a0km) rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near Pearl Harbor and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. Skyline aims to alleviate traffic congestion for West O\u02bbahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project has been criticized for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership. The line's first segment is slated to connect East Kapolei and Aloha Stadium and will open on June\u00a030, 2023.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Bicycle sharing[edit]\n\n\nSince June 28, 2017, Bikeshare Hawaii administers the bicycle sharing program in O\u02bbahu while Secure Bike Share operates the *Biki* system. Most *Biki* stations are between Chinatown/Downtown and Diamond Head, but a 2018 expansion added stations toward the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa Campus, Kapiolani Community College, Makiki, and Kalihi area.[102][103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Modal characteristics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey (five-year average), 56% of Urban Honolulu residents commuted to work by driving alone, 13.8% carpooled, 11.7% used public transportation, and 8.7% walked. About 5.7% commuted by bike, taxi, motorcycle or other forms of transportation, while 4.1% worked at home.[106]\n\n\nThe city of Honolulu has a high percentage of households without a motor vehicle. In 2015, 16.6% of Honolulu households were car-free, which increased slightly to 17.2% in 2016; by comparison, the United States national average was 8.7% in 2016. Honolulu averaged 1.4 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[107]\n\n\n\n## Public safety[edit]\n\n\nThe Honolulu Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency for the city and county of Honolulu and serves the entire Oahu Island. Honolulu Police Department has a mixed fleet of marked patrol cars and unmarked along with a subsidized vehicle program in place. Marked vehicles are white with blue stripes and white lettering HONOLULU POLICE. The Honolulu Police Departments lets officers of a certain rank purchase a private vehicle for police use. Subsidized vehicles are unmarked but have a small blue roof light.[108] Subsidized vehicles can be any make, model, or color, but must follow department rules and guidelines. Honolulu Police and Hawaii County Police on the Big Island are the only departments in the state of Hawaii and the U.S. with subsidized vehicles. Honolulu Police along with other city, county law enforcement in Hawaii uses blue lights for their vehicles. They also keep their cruise blue lights on while on patrol.[109]\n\n\nThe Honolulu Fire Department provides firefighting services and emergency medical services on Oahu. Fire trucks are yellow.[110]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Honolulu\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nHonolulu's sister cities are:[111]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Baguio, Philippines, 1991\n* ![](image) Baku, Azerbaijan, 1998\n* ![](image) Bruy\u00e8res, France, 1960\n* ![](image) Cali, Colombia, 2012\n* ![](image) Candon, Philippines, 2015\n* ![](image) Caracas, Venezuela, 1990\n* ![](image) Cebu City, Philippines, 1990\n* ![](image) Chengdu, China, 2011\n* ![](image) Chigasaki, Japan, 2014\n* ![](image) Fengxian (Shanghai), China, 2012\n* ![](image) Funchal, Portugal, 1979\n* ![](image) Fuzhou, China, 2021[112]\n* ![](image) Haikou, China, 1985\n* ![](image) Nore\u00f1a, Spain, 1960\n* ![](image) Hiroshima, Japan, 1959\n* ![](image) Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam, 1995\n* ![](image) Incheon, South Korea, 2003\n* ![](image) Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 1962\n* ![](image) Kyzyl, Russia, 2004\n* ![](image) Laoag, Philippines, 1969\n* ![](image) Majuro, Marshall Islands, 2001\n* ![](image) Mandaluyong, Philippines, 2005\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines, 1980\n* ![](image) Mombasa, Kenya, 2000\n* ![](image) Mumbai, India, 1970\n* ![](image) Nagaoka, Japan, 2012\n* ![](image) Naha, Japan, 1960\n* ![](image) Qinhuangdao, China, 2010\n* ![](image) Rabat, Morocco, 2007\n* ![](image) San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1985\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea, 1973\n* ![](image) Sintra, Portugal, 1998\n* ![](image) Uwajima, Japan, 2004\n* ![](image) Vigan, Philippines, 2003\n* ![](image) Yamaguchi, Japan, 2022\n* ![](image) Zhangzhou, China, 2012\n* ![](image) Zhongshan, China, 1997\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of tallest buildings in Honolulu\n* USS *Honolulu*, 3 ships\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** For statistical purposes, the US Census Bureau considers Honolulu to be a Census-designated place (CDP), rather than a city.[8]\n2. **^** There have been as many as 116\u00a0days (in 1995) that reached 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C), and as recently as, 2012, no days.[33] The average is comparable to Philadelphia despite being slightly warmer during the summer.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official records for Honolulu have been kept at downtown from February 1877 to September 1949, and at Honolulu Int'l since October 1949.

Located in the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan panhandle, it is a consolidated city-borough and the second-largest city in the United States by area. Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906, when the government of what was then the District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900.[5][6] The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality,[7] which is larger by area than both Rhode Island and Delaware.\n\n\nDowntown Juneau is nestled at the base of Mount Juneau and across the channel from Douglas Island. As of the 2020 census, the City and Borough had a population of 32,255,[3][8] making it the third-most populous city in Alaska after Anchorage and Fairbanks. Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from Quebec, Joe Juneau, though the place was once called *Rockwell* and then *Harrisburg* (after Juneau's co-prospector, Richard Harris). The Tlingit name of the town is *Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni* (\"Base of the Flounder's River\", *dz\u00e1nti* 'flounder,' *\u2013k\u02bci* 'base,' *h\u00e9en* 'river'), and Auke Bay just north of Juneau proper is called *\u00c1ak'w* (\"Little lake\", *\u00e1a* 'lake,' *-k\u02bc* 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The Taku River, just south of Juneau, was named after the cold *t'aakh* wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\n\nJuneau is unique among the 49 U.S. capitals on mainland North America in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state or North America. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a *de facto* island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's location on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging 16 feet (5\u00a0m), below steep mountains about 3,500 to 4,000 feet (1,100 to 1,200\u00a0m) high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\n\nThe Alaska State Capitol in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the state legislature and the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image shows Juneau in full coverage\n![](image)Core area of Juneau including Douglas Island from satellite image above\n![](image)Map including Juneau\n![](image)Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913\nThe Gastineau Channel was a fishing ground for the Auke (*A'akw Kw\u00e1an*) and Taku tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The *A'akw Kw\u00e1an* had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the Sealaska Heritage Institute, have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the National Park Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea. They continue to gather clams, gumboot chitons, grass and sea urchins there, as well as tree bark for medicinal uses.[9] The city and state supported Sealaska Heritage Institute in documenting the 78 acres (32\u00a0ha) site, and, in August 2016, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \"It is the first traditional cultural property in Southeast Alaska to be placed on the register.\"[9][10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Juneau City in 1887\nDescendants of these indigenous cultures include the Tlingit people. Native cultures have rich artistic traditions expressed in carving, weaving, orating, singing, and dancing. Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian of Southeast Alaska.\n\n\n\n### European encounters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Juneau Hotel near the Douglas-Juneau Bridge\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was Joseph Whidbey, master of the *Discovery* during George Vancouver's 1791\u201395 expedition. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel. He later recorded seeing the channel again, this time from the west. He said it was unnavigable, being filled with ice.[11]\n\n\n\n### Mining era[edit]\n\n\nAfter the California gold rush, miners migrated up the Pacific Coast and explored the West, seeking other gold deposits. In 1880, Sitka mining engineer George Pilz offered a reward to any local native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However, Pilz sent Joe Juneau (cousin of Milwaukee co-founder Solomon Juneau) and Richard Harris back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book *Alaska Days with John Muir*, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a 160-acre (650,000\u00a0m2) town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first European American settlement founded in this territory after the United States purchased Alaska.\n\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris. On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after prospector Joe Juneau.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### Establishment of Russian Orthodox Church[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, built 1894 by Tlingit and Serbians in Juneau\nPerhaps because of the pressure of this European encroachment, some Tlingit appealed to the Russian Orthodox Church. It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the Tlingit language in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.[14]\n\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church. The iconostasis has six large panels sent from Russia.[14]\n\n\n\n### Development of mining[edit]\n\n\nDuring this period, prospector and placer miner John Lemon operated in what is today the Lemon Creek area. The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\n\nMajor mining operations in the Juneau mining district prior to World War II included the Treadwell Mine, The Alaska-Juneau Mine, and Alaska-Gastineau Mine.\n\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, Sitka, the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.[6] Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing Fairbanks in the 1920 census. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by Anchorage in 1950.\n\n\n\n### Selection as capital[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial to the founders of the city, Richard Harris and Joe Juneau.\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. World War I delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the Art Deco architectural style. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by James Knox Taylor in the Federal style. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is 14,400 square feet (1,340\u00a0m2). It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President Warren G. Harding became the first president to visit Alaska. Harding visited the Governor's Mansion while Territorial Governor Scott Bone, who was appointed by Harding, was in office. Harding spoke from the porch of the mansion explaining his policies and met with attendees.\n\n\nDuring World War II, more than 50 Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans residing in Juneau were evacuated to the internment camps inland as a result of Executive Order 9066\u2014which authorized the forced removal of all ethnic Japanese away from their homes and businesses on the West Coast of the United States. The removal of Juneau's Japanese community during the war was later commemorated known as the *Empty Chair Memorial* in July 2014 during a dedication ceremony at the neighborhood of Capital School Park in the city.[15]\n\n\nRobert Atwood, then publisher of the *Anchorage Times* and an Anchorage \"booster\", was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least 30 miles (48\u00a0km) from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to Willow, a town 70 miles (110\u00a0km) north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million. A 1984 \"ultimate\" capital-move vote also failed, as did a 1996 vote.\n\n\nJuneau remains the capital.[16] Once Alaska was granted statehood in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government. After construction of the Alaska Pipeline in 1977, the state budget was flush with oil revenues, and it expanded programs for the people. That growth slowed considerably in the 1980s.[17]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Juneau at night\nIn 2005, the state demographer projected slow growth in the borough for the next twenty years.[18] Cruise ship tourism has expanded rapidly, from approximately 230,000 passengers in 1990 to nearly 1,000,000 in 2006, as cruise lines have built more and larger ships. They sail to Juneau seven days a week over a longer season than before, but the cruising tourism is still primarily a summer industry. It provides few year-round jobs but stimulates summer employment in the city.\n\n\nIn 2010, the city was recognized as part of the \"Playful City USA\" initiative by KaBOOM!, created to honor cities that ensure their children have great places to play.[19]\n\n\nJuneau is larger in area than the state of Delaware and was, for several decades, the country's largest city by area. (Sitka surpassed it in 2000 when it incorporated.) Juneau continues to be the only U.S. state capital on an international border: it is bordered on the east by Canada. It is the U.S. state capital whose namesake was most recently alive: Joe Juneau died in 1899.\n\n\nThe city was temporarily renamed UNO, after the card game, on April 1, 2016 (April Fool's Day).[20][21] The change was part of a promotion with Mattel to draw \"attention to new wild cards in [the] game\".[20] For Juneau's cooperation, Mattel donated $15,000 \"to the Juneau Community Foundation in honor of late Mayor Greg Fisk.\"[20]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Douglas Island as seen from mainland Juneau. The island is connected to the mainland by the Juneau-Douglas Bridge.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has an area of 3,255 square miles (8,430\u00a0km2). In land area Juneau (proper) is also the largest of the United States capital cities and also the second-largest city overall in the United States by area,[22] with 2,716.7 square miles (7,036\u00a0km2) being made up of land and 538.3 square miles (1,394\u00a0km2) consisting of water (16.54%).\n\n\nCentral (downtown) Juneau is at 58\u00b018\u203200\u2033N 134\u00b024\u203258\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff58.30000\u00b0N 134.41611\u00b0W\ufeff / 58.30000; -134.41611.[23] The City and Borough of Juneau includes Douglas Island, a tidal island to the west of mainland Juneau. Douglas Island can be reached via the Juneau-Douglas Bridge.\n\n\nAs is the case throughout Southeast Alaska, the Juneau area is susceptible to damage caused by natural disasters. The 2014 Palma Bay earthquake caused widespread outages to telecommunications in the area due to damage to a fiber optic cable serving the area. In April 2008, a series of massive avalanches outside Juneau heavily damaged the electrical lines providing Juneau with power, knocking the hydroelectric system offline and forcing the utility to switch to a much more expensive diesel system.\n\n\n\n### Adjacent boroughs and census areas[edit]\n\n\n* Haines Borough, Alaska \u2013 northwest, west\n* Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska \u2013 south, southwest\n* Petersburg Borough, Alaska \u2013 quadripoint\n\n\n### Border area[edit]\n\n\nJuneau, Alaska, shares its eastern border with the Canadian province of British Columbia.

The city's climate is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Pacific Ocean, specifically the warm Alaska Current, and the Coast Mountains that form a natural orographic barrier for incoming air. The weather is thus mild and moist, which, as in other parts of the Alaska Panhandle, allows the growth of temperate rainforests.[25] Like other settlements in the area, Juneau does not experience permafrost.[26]\n\n\nThere are two prevalent types of wind in Juneau. Particularly in winter, the Aleutian Low will draw warm and moist air from the south, bringing ample snow- or rainfall, and even in summer, winds will tend to blow onshore. The strength and frequency of the rainfall will depend from several factors, including the presence of El Ni\u00f1o (more mild and rainy weather) or La Ni\u00f1a (colder and drier periods due to the presence of an anticyclone in the Gulf of Alaska). Conversely, offshore winds from the interior are normally dry but may have extreme variations in temperature.[25]\n\n\nTemperatures vary relatively little over the year. Winters are mild by Alaskan standards, with the average temperature of January slightly below freezing and highs often above 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0.0\u00a0\u00b0C); summers are rather cool but occasionally may get warm. Temperatures above 75\u00a0\u00b0F (23.9\u00a0\u00b0C) or below 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212.2\u00a0\u00b0C) are not unheard of but are rare. Precipitation falls on an average 230 days per year, averaging 62.27 inches (1,580\u00a0mm) at the airport (1981\u20132010 normals), but ranging from 55 to 92 inches (1,400 to 2,340\u00a0mm), depending on location.[27] Most of it will occur in fall and winter, some falling as snow from November to March.\n\n\nRecords have been officially kept at downtown Juneau from January 1890 to June 1943, and at Juneau International Airport since July 1943. The coldest temperature ever officially recorded in Juneau was \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230.0\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 2, 1968, and January 12, 1972, while the hottest was 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32.2\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 7, 1975.[28] The normals and record temperatures for both downtown and the airport are given below.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Juneau, Alaska (Juneau Int'l, 1991\u20132020

It was formally incorporated in 1900, and on July 1, 1970, the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality, which accounts for the population jump between the 1970 and 1980 censuses.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 31,275 people, 12,922 households. The population density was 11.9 per square mile (4.6/km2), making it the least densely populated state capital. There were 12,922 housing units at an average density of 4.0 per square mile (1.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city/borough was 64.7% White (62.5% Non-Hispanic White), 1.0% African American, 10.1% Native American or Alaska Native, 6.7% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, and 14.3% from two or more races. 7.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[37] 2.6% reported speaking Tagalog at home, and 2.4% reported speaking Spanish.[38]\n\n\nThe median income for a household in the city/borough was $90,126. The per capita income for the city/borough was $45,607. 7.2% of the population was below the poverty line.[39]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the University of Alaska Southeast. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fourth Street in downtown, looking easterly from the front of the Alaska State Capitol. The city's tallest building, Mendenhall Towers (at least 11 stories tall),[41] is partially visible in the background.\nAnother large contributor to the local economy is the tourism industry, which generates most income in the summer months. In 2005, the cruise ship industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.[42] On the other hand, former politician Bill Ray, who previously lived in Juneau and represented Juneau in the Alaska Legislature, said: \"Juneau doesn't go forward. They've prostituted themselves to tourism. It looks like a poor man's Lahaina\".[43]\n\n\nThe fishing industry is still a major part of the Juneau economy, while not as strong as when the halibut schooner fleet generated considerable profits. Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan. The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries. Alaska Seaplanes, an airline, has its headquarters in Juneau.[44] Highliner Construction, a general contractor is based there as well.[45]\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 1,107 businesses with operations in Juneau borough and thus, with a population of 31,275, a per capita of roughly 28 people per business.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nJuneau's only power utility is Alaska Electric Light & Power (AEL&P). Most of the electricity in the borough is generated at the Snettisham Hydroelectric facility in the southern end of the borough, accessible only by boat or plane. In April 2008, an avalanche destroyed three transmission towers, forcing AEL&P to supply almost all of the borough's electricity from diesel-powered generators for one month.[46]\n\n\nAlso headquartered in Juneau is the Marine Exchange of Alaska, a nonprofit organization which operates an extensive vessel tracking network and ensures safe maritime operations for the entire state.[47]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nJuneau hosts the annual Alaska Folk Festival, Juneau Jazz & Classics music festival, and Celebration, a biennial Alaska Native cultural festival.\n\n\nJuneau has a city-owned ski resort, Eaglecrest, located on Douglas Island.\n\n\n\n![](image)Auk Village Totem 458\nThe city-owned Treadwell ice-skating rink is located on the south end of Douglas Island. It is named after the Treadwell Gold Mine, which is located next to the rink. The rink is open for figure skating, hockey and free open skate. From April to September; when the ice is melted it is used for rollerblading, roller hockey, tennis, basketball, concerts.[48]\n\n\nThe city has a vibrant performing arts scene and is home to Perseverance Theatre, Alaska's largest professional theater, the non-profit Theatre in the Rough, Theater Alaska, Theater at Latitude 58, and Juneau Ghost Light Theatre (formerly Juneau Douglas Little Theatre). The Juneau Symphony performs regularly. The Juneau Lyric Opera and Opera to Go are the two local opera companies. The JUMP Society hosts screenings of locally made short films two times a year. The local art house cinema is Gold Town Nickelodeon which plays independent films, foreign films, classics, and also runs the drive-in.\n\n\nDowntown Juneau has art galleries that participate in the monthly First Friday Art Walk and annual Gallery Walk held in the first week of December. The Juneau Arts & Humanities Council coordinates events and operates the Juneau Arts & Culture Center, which features a community center, gallery and lobby shop. The University of Alaska Southeast Campus offers lectures, concerts, and theater performances. Sealaska Heritage, the nonprofit affiliate of the Sealaska Corporation, operates The Walter Soboleff Building which is decorated by carvings and hosts cultural exhibits.\n\n\n\n## Efforts to move state capital[edit]\n\n\nThroughout its statehood, there have been efforts and discussions on moving Alaska's capital away from Juneau.[49] A primary motivating factor has been concerns about Juneau's remote location.[50]\n\n\nIn 1960, 56% of voters voted against a measure to move the capital to a location in the \"Cook Inlet-Railbelt Area\" (the specific location would subsequently be selected by a committee appointed by the governor).[49] In 1962, 55% of voters voted against a measure to move the capital to \"Western Alaska...within 30 miles of Anchorage\" which would have seen \"senior\" state senators select three potential sites to be put to a vote by later vote by the state's electorate.[49]\n\n\nIn 1974, at a time when Alaska was expected to be flush with new funds from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, 56% Alaskan voters approved an initiative to move the capital.[49][50][51] The initiative specified that the new location must be within 300 miles of both Anchorage and Fairbanks and have at least 100 square miles of donated public land. The initiative would have the final location selected by a committee appointed by the governor. The committee proposed Larson Lake, Mount Yenlo, and Willow as sites, and Willow received 53% of votes in a 1976 statewide vote. However, in 1978, voters rejected a measure to fund a move to Willow, with 55% of voters voting against spending $996 million to move the capital there.[49][50] In 1978, voters also approved the Fiscally Responsible Alaskans Needing Knowledge (FRANK) Initiative, which required that all costs of moving the capital be disclosed and approved by Alaskans before the move commenced.[49] In 1982, 53% of voters voted against spending roughly $2.9 billion to move the capital to Willow. This vote also had the effect of repealing the previous approval of moving the capital.[49]\n\n\nIn 1994, a statewide initiative to move Alaska's capital to Wasilla was defeated by a vote of 116,277 (54.7%) to 96,398 (45.3%). At the same time, 77% of voters approved a renewed FRANK Initiative.[49][52][53]\n\n\nIn 2002, Alaskan voters again voted against moving the state's capital.[50]\n\n\nAdvocacy for a capital move has continued.[49][54]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Carlos Boozer (born 1981), professional basketball player\n* Gab Cody, playwright, filmmaker\n* Dale DeArmond (1914\u20132006), printmaker\n* Mike Dunleavy (born 1961), current governor of Alaska\n* Neva Egan (1914\u20132011), Educator and First Lady of Alaska\n* Janet Gardner (born 1962), singer of the hard rock band Vixen\n* Al Gross (born 1962), surgeon, fisherman, and politician\n* Mary McGee (born 1936), motorcycle racer\n* Joshua Morrow (born 1974), actor known for starring in daytime drama *The Young and the Restless*\n* Rie Mu\u00f1oz (1921\u20132015), artist and Bureau of Indian Affairs educator\n* Elizabeth Peratrovich (1911\u20131958), civil rights activist, Grand President of the Alaska Native Sisterhood, member of the Tlingit nation.\n* Linda Rosenthal, violinist\n* Paul Rosenthal (born 1942), violinist\n* Lynn Schooler, photographer, writer who authored *The Blue Bear*\n* James Schoppert (1947\u20131992), carver, painter\n* Molly Smith, theatre director\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of mayors of Juneau, Alaska\n\n![](image)Juneau City Hall\nThe City and Borough of Juneau operates under a council\u2013manager form of government. The mayor is the titular head of the city, is the presiding officer (or chair) of the Juneau Assembly (council), and is one of three members of that body elected at-large, or areawide. The remaining six members are elected by single-member districts: two districts have been defined by the Assembly, as of its last redistricting in 2003:[55]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * District 1 precincts\n\t+ Douglas\n\t+ Juneau No. 1\n\t+ Juneau No. 2\n\t+ Juneau No. 3\n\t+ Juneau Airport\n\t+ Lemon Creek\n\t+ North Douglas\n | * District 2 precincts\n\t+ Auke Bay\n\t+ Lynn Canal\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 1\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 2\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 3\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 4\n |\n\n They hire a professional city manager to handle daily affairs and a city attorney for legal matters.\n\n\nThese districts are nearly aligned with the boundaries of the 31st and 32nd election districts that were established by the state. The main difference is that the 32nd District includes communities outside the CBJ: Gustavus, Kupreanof, Petersburg, Skagway and Tenakee Springs. The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during redistricting in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected Democrats to the Alaska House of Representatives, while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected Republicans. The 31st District is represented in the House by Democrat Andi Story, who has been in office since 2018. The 32nd District is represented by Democrat Sara Hannan.\n\n\nCombined, these two election districts form Alaska Senate District Q. That seat is held by Democrat Jesse Kiehl. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Juneau, Alaska[56]\n| Year\n | Republican | Democratic | Third party |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No.\u202f | % | No.\u202f | % | No.\u202f | %\n |\n| **2020** | 6,210\n | 35.11%\n | 10,834\n | **61.25%** | 643\n | 3.64%\n |\n| **2016** | 5,690\n | 34.57%\n | 8,734\n | **53.07%** | 2,033\n | 12.35%\n |\n| **2012** | 6,108\n | 37.90%\n | 9,251\n | **57.40%** | 757\n | 4.70%\n |\n| **2008** | 7,124\n | 40.70%\n | 9,819\n | **56.10%** | 560\n | 3.20%\n |\n| **2004** | 5,515\n | 47.20%\n | 5,784\n | **49.50%** | 386\n | 3.30%\n |\n| **2000** | 7,270\n | **45.30%** | 6,403\n | 39.90%\n | 2,375\n | 14.80%\n |\n| **1996** | 6,004\n | 39.30%\n | 6,768\n | **44.30%** | 2,506\n | 16.40%\n |\n| **1992** | 5,348\n | 35.00%\n | 6,754\n | **44.20%** | 3,178\n | 20.80%\n |\n| **1988** | 5,957\n | 48.20%\n | 6,056\n | **49.00%** | 345\n | 2.79%\n |\n| **1984** | 7,323\n | **56.60%** | 5,292\n | 40.90%\n | 324\n | 2.50%\n |\n| **1980** | 4,600\n | **44.80%** | 3,594\n | 35.00%\n | 2,075\n | 20.21%\n |\n| **1976** | 4,676\n | **58.80%** | 2,887\n | 36.30%\n | 390\n | 4.90%\n |\n| **1972** | 3,678\n | **56.00%** | 2,725\n | 41.49%\n | 165\n | 2.51%\n |\n| **1968** | 2,532\n | 44.70%\n | 2,770\n | **48.91%** | 362\n | 6.39%\n |\n| **1964** | 1,544\n | 29.09%\n | 3,763\n | **70.91%** | 0\n | 0.00%\n |\n| **1960** | 2,328\n | **52.49%** | 2,107\n | 47.51%\n | 0\n | 0.00%\n |\n\n\nJuneau is one of the most Democratic boroughs in Alaska. The Borough has voted Democratic in the U.S. presidential election in every election (except for one) since 1988.\n\n\nWhile there are more state jobs based in Anchorage than in Juneau, the state government still maintains a substantial presence in Juneau. A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau. The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from Southcentral Alaska to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the Alaska State Capitol, which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the Legislative Affairs Agency. These buildings were named for former legislators Terry Miller and Thomas B. Stewart. Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the 1st Alaska State Legislature. He later served in Juneau's Alaska Superior Court judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of Alaska's history.\n\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along Gold Creek near its mouth and a short distance east of the Juneau-Douglas Bridge, the building houses numerous federal agencies, the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, and Juneau's main post office. It was designed by Linn A. Forrest and constructed in 1966. Under the Alaska Statehood Act, the Federal and Territorial Building was transferred to the new state for use as its capitol.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\nJuneau is served by the Juneau School District,[57] and includes the following schools:[58]\n\n\n\n* Say\u00e9ik: Gastineau Elementary School [59]\n* Harborview Elementary School\n* Riverbend Elementary School\n* Mendenhall River Elementary School\n* S\u00edt\u02bc Eet\u00ed Shaan\u00e1x\u0331 - Glacier Valley Elementary School\n* Auke Bay Elementary School\n* Juneau Community Charter School: *an optional program (kindergarten through eighth grade)*\n* Montessori Borealis School: *an alternative school with (Children\u02bcs House: preschool and kindergarten; Elementary: first through sixth grade; Adolescent Montessori Program: seventh and eighth grades)*[60]\n* Tlingit Culture Language & Literacy: *an optional program (kindergarten through fifth grade)*[61]\n* Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School\n* Floyd Dryden Middle School\n* Juneau-Douglas Yadaa.at Kal\u00e9 High School[62]\n* Thunder Mountain High School\n* Yaa\u1e35oosg\u00e9 Daakah\u00eddi Alternative High School\n* HomeBRIDGE: a homeschooling program\n\nThe following private schools serve Juneau:\n\n\n\n* (Glacier) Valley Baptist Academy\n* Faith Community School\n* Thunder Mountain Learning Center (formerly Thunder Mountain Academy)\n* Juneau Seventh-day Adventist Christian School\n* Juneau Montessori School\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Alaska Southeast is within the Auke Bay community along the shore of Auke Lake. Juneau-Douglas Community College, founded in 1956, and Southeastern Senior College, established in 1972, were merged in 1980 forming the University of Alaska Juneau. The university was restructured as the University of Alaska Southeast to include Ketchikan and Sitka campuses. The university offers undergraduate and graduate studies. The University of Alaska Fairbanks has a satellite campus in Juneau for marine studies, primarily graduate level.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nJuneau is not directly accessible by road, although there are road connections within the borough to rural areas. Glacier Highway section of Alaska Route 7 runs within Juneau. Primary access to the city is by air and sea. Cars and trucks are transported to and from Juneau by barge or the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system.\n\n\n\n![](image)An Alaska Marine Highway ferry boat docked in Juneau, Alaska\n![](image)Juneau is a popular cruise ship destination\n![](image)Alaska Airlines flight moments after landing at Juneau International Airport\n![](image)View of downtown Juneau, Alaska from the Juneau-Douglas Bridge. The bridge connects mainland Juneau with Douglas Island.\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nThe state-owned ferry system is called the Alaska Marine Highway. The Southeast ferries connect Juneau with 13 other cities in Southeast Alaska and other destinations north via Whittier, as well as with the continental road system in Bellingham, Washington, and Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Going north, the ferries dock in Haines and Skagway connecting to the Alaska Highway via Whitehorse, Yukon.[63] In addition to the traditional Alaska Marine Highway ferries, high-speed catamarans known as \"Fast cats\" connect Juneau with Haines and Skagway (91 miles (146\u00a0km)) in half the time of the traditional ferries, needing around four hours' travel time.[64]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nJuneau International Airport serves the city and borough of Juneau. Alaska Airlines services the airport year round, operating upwards of 11 daily departures. Alaska Airlines serves Juneau and other Southeast Alaska villages via \"Milk Run\" flights which make multiple stops to and from Seattle or Anchorage. Alaska also connects Juneau to other cities in the country through connections in Seattle or Anchorage.\n\n\nIn the summer, Delta Air Lines serves Juneau from its major West Coast hub in Seattle, providing global service to and from Southeast Alaska without having to switch air carriers.\n\n\nIn the past, MarkAir and Western Airlines serviced Juneau.[65] Alaska Seaplanes and Ward Air offer charter seaplane service from the seaplane floatpond \"runway\" that runs parallel to the traditional tarmac. They offer service to the smaller villages in the surrounding area as well as flightseeing.\n\n\nAlaska Seaplanes, Harris Air, and Island Air Express provide FAA Part 135 scheduled commuter service to communities throughout Southeast Alaska. These trips are the only connections to the outside world for many of these villages. Alaska Seaplanes has restored scheduled international service to Juneau with 3 weekly trips to Whitehorse, Canada, while Ward Air provides unscheduled charter flights to Canada.[66]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nAvalanche hazards, steep slopes, cold weather and environmental protection concerns are factors that make road construction and maintenance both difficult and costly.\n\n\nThe Juneau-Douglas Bridge connects the Juneau mainland with Douglas Island.\n\n\nThere are no roads connecting Juneau to the rest of North America, although cars can use the ferries to connect to the road network. The reason for the lack of roads is due to the lack of options a road could be placed. A route to the east would fail as an icefield the size of Rhode Island separates Juneau from Atlin, British Columbia. Similarly, the route up the Taku River is blocked by ever-shifting glaciers.[67] Juneau is one of only four state capitals not served by an Interstate highway (the others being Dover, Delaware, Jefferson City, Missouri, and Pierre, South Dakota).[68]\n\n\n\n#### Juneau Access Project[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lynn Canal Highway\n\nJuneau's roads remain separate from other roads in Alaska and in the Lower 48. There have been plans to connect Juneau to Haines and Skagway by road since before 1972, with funding for the first feasibility study acquired in 1987.[69] The State of Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities announced in 2005 that the connection was to be provided partly by road, and partly by fast ferry. A 51-mile (82\u00a0km) road would be built on the east side of Lynn Canal to a new ferry terminal at the Katzehin River estuary.[70] A ferry would take cars from the terminal to Haines and Skagway, where the cars could then access the rest of North America.[70] In 2006, the project was estimated to cost $258 million, and in 2007, the estimate was increased to $350 million.[70] Annual costs have been estimated from $2.1 million to $12 million, depending on the length of the road.[69] The Western Federal Lands Center estimated the project would cost $491 million.[70]\n\n\nLocal opinions on constructing a road link to the outside world were mixed. Some residents saw such a road as a much-needed link between Juneau and the rest of the world which will also provide great economic benefits to the city, while many other residents were concerned about the project's financial costs along with environmental and social impacts it could have on Lynn Canal.[71]\n\n\nCiting the state's multibillion-dollar financial crisis, Governor Bill Walker announced on December 15, 2016, that the state is no longer backing construction of the Juneau Access Improvements Project.[72] Eventually the project lost its steam and was ended in July 2018 with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) releasing their Record of Decision, selecting the no-build alternative for the Juneau Access Project, halting construction on the road.[73][74][75]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\nLocal government operates a bus service under the name Capital Transit.\n\n\n\n### Walking, hiking, and biking[edit]\n\n\nResidents walk, hike, or ride bicycles for recreational purposes and for transportation. The downtown area of Juneau has sidewalks, and the neighborhoods on the hill above downtown are accessible by foot. Some roads in the city also have bike lanes, and there is a bike path parallel to the main highway.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nThe city and borough is primarily served by Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau's Twin Lakes area. The hospital also serves the nearby remote communities of Hoonah, Haines, and Skagway. Individuals in these communities must be airlifted to the hospital via helicopter or air ambulance (ranging from a 20-minute to a 45-minute flight, depending on location).\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nJuneau is served by the following utilities:\n\n\n\n* Electric: Alaska Electric Light and Power Company\n* Water and Sewer: City and Borough of Juneau\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Juneau, Alaska\n\n### Print[edit]\n\n\nJuneau's only daily newspaper, the *Juneau Empire*, is published Wednesdays and Saturdays. There is also a regional weekly newspaper, the *Capital City Weekly*. The University of Alaska Southeast has *The Whalesong*, a college newspaper.\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n* AM: KJNO 630, KINY 800, KXXJ 1330\n* FM: KTKU 105.1, KSUP 106.3, and LPFM station KBJZ-LP 94.1.\n* Public Radio: KTOO 104.3, KXLL \"Excellent Radio\" 100.7 and KRNN \"Rain Country Radio\" 102.7 (all 3 operated by KTOO).\n\n\nThe studios of CoastAlaska (a regional public radio station consortium), are in Juneau. AP (the Associated Press), Anchorage news outlets, and other Alaska media entities, send reporters to Juneau during the annual Legislative session.\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nJuneau's major television affiliates are: KTOO (PBS), 360 North \"Alaska's public affairs channel\" (Operated by KTOO), KATH-LD (NBC), KYEX-LD (CBS/MyNetworkTV on DT2) and KJUD (ABC)/The CW on DT2/Fox on DT3).\n\n\nThe Juneau-Douglas High School video program produces television programming, including a weekly 10-minute TV newscast, *JDTV News*, during the spring semester.\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nJuneau has five official sister cities.[76]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada\n* ![](image) Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada\n* ![](image) Chiayi City, Taiwan[77]\n* ![](image) Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, Russia\n* ![](image) Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines [78]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Alaska portal\n\n\n* Juneau gold belt\n* Adair-Kennedy Memorial Park\n* Capital City Fire/Rescue\n* Evergreen Cemetery\n* Hurff Ackerman Saunders Federal Building and Robert Boochever U.S. Courthouse\n* Juneau Mountain Rescue\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska\n* Alaska Route 7\n* Out the road, a region of Juneau\n* USS *Juneau*, 3 ships\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2020 U.S. Gazetteer Files\".
