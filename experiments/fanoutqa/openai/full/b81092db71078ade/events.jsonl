The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

With capital provided by the Ministry of Finance of China,[12] the bank's Tier 1 capital in 2013 was the largest of one thousand global banks, being the first bank headquartered in China to achieve this distinction in modern history.[13][9] Subsequently, ranked the largest bank in the world 2017 and 2018, by total assets,[14] (31 December 2020, US$4.324 trillion[8]), ICBC was positioned at 1st in The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks ranking, every year from 2012,[15] and first (2019) on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's biggest public companies.[16] ICBC is also the 3rd largest bank in the world by market capitalization at $211 billion (31-Dec-2022).[17]\n\n\nFurthermore, ICBC is considered one of the most profitable companies in the world, ranking fourth according to Forbes.[18] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\nSeveral former employees of ICBC have moved on to work in prominent government positions in China. Notable ICBC alumni include Chairman of CSRC Huiman Yi, and Deputy Governor of PBoC Gongsheng Pan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ICBC building in Tokyo\n![](image)ICBC building in Luxembourg\n![](image)ICBC building in Karachi\n![](image)ICBC Beijing Qunfang Sub-branch at Universal Beijing Resort\n### Preconditions of 1948–1979[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1948 the mono-banking system of China was the People's Bank of China, providing both policy lending, and, operations to the commercial sector. During 1978 to[19] 1979 banking reform was initiated by the government of China, with the express desire of bringing into existence a central bank accompanying four total central governmentally owned specializing banks, one of these four being ICBC.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1979–1985[edit]\n\n\nA Two-Tier banking system was made.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1984–2005[edit]\n\n\nBy rights of a contradiction within the economic functioning of the government of China, the People's Republic, the State Council of China,[21] during September of[22] 1983 made a decision to separate certain activities of the government to an exclusively operating organisation, subsequently named the Industrial and Commercial bank of China,[21] established on 1 January 1984.[11][*non-primary source needed*] ICBC was then the fourth of the four specialist banks of 1978–1979 to be made,[22] from the taking of control of commercial activities[22] (\"industrial credit and savings business\"[23]) from People's Bank of China so that the latter might be transformed to a newly made central bank.[22][23] ICBC focused on the intermediation of deposits.[24]: 225\n\n\nICBC opened a branch in Luxembourg which became the European headquarters of the bank in 2011.[25] ICBC (Europe) S.A. operates a network covering branches in major European cities, namely Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Warsaw and Lisbon.[26]\n\n\nThe bank's Hong Kong operations are listed under the name ICBC Asia. It has purchased the Hong Kong subsidiary of Fortis Bank and rebranded it under its own name on 10 October 2005.\n\n\nIn June 2005, ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co., Ltd., a joint venture between ICBC (55%), Credit Suisse First Boston (25%) and COSCO (20%), was formally established in China. Subsequently, ICBC acquired the 20% stake from COSCO and a 5% stake from CSFB.\n\n\n\n### 2006–2008[edit]\n\n\n#### Customer base[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2006, ICBC had 2.5 million corporate customers and 150 million individual customers.[27]\n\n\n\n#### IPO[edit]\n\n\nIn the runup to its planned initial public offering, on 28 April 2006, three \"strategic investors\" injected US$3.7 billion into ICBC:\n\n\n\n* Goldman Sachs purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6 billion, the largest sum Goldman Sachs has ever invested.[28]\n* Dresdner Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of Commerzbank) invested US$1 billion.[29]\n* American Express invested US$200 million.[29]\n\n\nICBC was simultaneously listed on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange on 27 October 2006. It was the world's largest IPO at that time valued at US$21.9 billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4 billion IPO by Japan's NTT DoCoMo in 1998.[30] In 2010, Agricultural Bank of China broke ICBC's IPO record when it raised $22.1 billion. China's largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.\n\n\nICBC raised at least US$14 billion in Hong Kong (H-shares) and another US$5.1 billion in Shanghai (A-shares). Due to heavy subscriptions, the greenshoe (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and ICBC's take rose to US$21.9 billion (17% of ICBC's market value before the IPO), divided in US$16 billion in Hong Kong and US$5.9 billion in Shanghai. Following the global offering, the free float of shares was 22.14% of the market capitalization.\n\n\nAt the end of its first day of trading, the bank's shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in Hong Kong, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to Bloomberg, ICBC's market capitalisation at the end of trade based on its Hong Kong shares was US$156.3 billion, making its equity the world's fifth highest among banks, just behind JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, ICBC's Shanghai-listed A-shares recorded more modest gains and ended up 5.1% from the offering price of RMB 3.12.\n\n\nDuring July 2007 ICBC was ranked 30th in the world in terms of revenue.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign activity[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, ICBC became the second Chinese bank since 1991 to gain federal approval to establish a branch in New York City.[32] ICBC had signed a lease with the Trump Organization for office space in the Trump Tower in 2008. ICBC was Trump Tower's largest office tenant as of 2012.[33] By October 2020, Donald Trump received $5.4 million from ICBC via the Trump Tower lease.[34]\n\n\nICBC loans $400 million towards the completion of the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia. Groups that oppose the dam such as International Rivers and Survival International have complained about or have written to ICBC against the dam's funding.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 January 2011, ICBC opened a branch office in Madrid, Spain.[37]\n\n\nOn 20 May 2011, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. established two branches in Pakistan, one in Karachi, the other in Islamabad. On 18 August 2011, ICBC passed the examination from State Bank of Pakistan and started its business in Pakistan.\n\n\nDuring November 2012, ICBC acquires a 80% stake (valued at $600 million) of Standard Bank Argentina, the largest operation of a Chinese bank in Latin America. In Argentina, the bank has ~1,000,000 individual customers, ~30,000 companies of all categories and more than 1600 corporate companies.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[38]\n\n\nIt was announced at the end of July 2013 that South Africa's Standard Bank was in talks to sell its markets business in London to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for more than $500 million.[39]\n\n\nOn 24 September 2014, ICBC Kuwait Branch officially opened in Kuwait City, capital of Kuwait. As the first and currently the only Chinese bank in Kuwait, the establishment of ICBC Kuwait Branch ended the history of no Chinese bank's presence in Kuwait. Meanwhile, it is also the fourth branch of ICBC in the Middle East, following branches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha.\n\n\nAs of 2 December 2014, ICBC is ranked the largest bank in the world by assets and by tier 1 capital.[40]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2015, the Company further strengthened its presence in the Middle East and Europe by purchasing[41] Turkey's TekstilBank and forming its ICBC Turkey subsidiary.\n\n\nOn 17 February 2016, the Spanish Guardia Civil raided the offices of ICBC in Madrid, Spain, investigating suspicions of money laundering.[37]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2016, the bank obtained a license to take deposits in Russia.\n\n\nICBC Financial Services, the bank's brokerage unit, provided about $88 billion of repo financing at the end of 2015, up from $59 billion two years ago, according to regulatory filings. The figures are before netting agreements that can be used to reduce overall assets and liabilities. Almost all the repo financing that ICBC provides is on U.S. government bonds.[42]\n\n\nICBC launched robo-advisor service to its wealth-management operations in 2017.[43][44]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Bank reported a 3.3 percent rise in its net profit for the third quarter.[45]\n\n\nICBC reported 10.3 pct growth in its profit along with exceptional growth in its revenue during the year 2021. This was caused by the gradual recovery of the Chinese economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.[46]\n\n\nIn November 2023, the bank was subject to a ransomware attack, preventing certain trades from clearing.[47]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n### Accounting[edit]\n\n\nICBC has the policy[48] of preparing accounts conforming to the[8] International Financial Reporting Standards,[49][8] accepting specifically criteria IFRS 9 (pertains to the definition and rating of asset, liability, and a number of all of the existing purchasing contracts for non-financial purchases[50]) from 1 January 2018. and IFRS 16 (pertaining to lease[51]) from 1 January 2019.[48]\n\n\n\n### Basic figures[edit]\n\n\n#### 2005[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, net profit was up 12.4% to RMB 33.7 billion, and the total loan balance was RMB 3,289.5 billion. Total liabilities are RMB 6,196.2 billion, up 11.2%. Delinquent or non-performing loans (NPL) total RMB 154.4 billion, a significant reduction although the figures are widely regarded as being somewhat higher than officially stated. It has an NPL ratio of 4.69% and a capital adequacy ratio of 9.89%.\n\n\n\n#### Summary[edit]\n\n\n##### 2003–2018[edit]\n\n\nFinancials in Renminbi[5][52][53][54][55][56][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue, bln | 107.5 | 126.7 | 193.1 | 181.6 | 257.4 | 310.2 | 309.4 | 380.7\n |\n| Net Income, bln | 2.473 | 2.311 | 33.70 | 49.26 | 81.52 | 110.8 | 129.4 | 166.0\n |\n| Assets, trln | 5.279 | 5.671 | 6.454 | 7.509 | 8.684 | 9.757 | 11.79 | 13.46\n |\n| Equity, bln | 170.5 | 163.0 | 253.4 | 466.5 | 538.4 | 602.7 | 673.9 | 820.4\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue, bln | 470.6 | 529.7 | 578.9 | 634.9 | 668.7 | 641.7 | 675.7 | 725.1\n |\n| Net Income, bln | 208.4 | 238.7 | 263.0 | 276.3 | 277.7 | 279.1 | 287.5 | 298.7\n |\n| Assets, trln | 15.48 | 17.54 | 18.92 | 20.61 | 22.21 | 24.14 | 26.09 | 27.70\n |\n| Equity, bln | 956.7 | 1125 | 1274 | 1531 | 1789 | 1970 | 2127 | 2330\n |\n\n\n### Loans[edit]\n\n\n#### Listed to industry[edit]\n\n\nIn millions of Chinese RMB (Yuan) in 2005:\n\n\n\n* Manufacturing: 662,376, 20.1% (28.7% in 2004)\n* Transportation, storage, postage & telecommunications: 367,371, 11.2% (10.2% in 2004)\n* Power, gas and water: 281,179, 8.6% (7.0% in 2004)\n* Retail and wholesale, catering: 265,906, 8.1% (6.9% in 2004)\n* Property development: 194,024, 5.9%, (5.6% in 2004)\n* Social service organization: 103,070, 3.1%, (3.2% in 2004)\n* Construction: 89,666, 2.7%, (2.1% in 2004)\n* Other industries: 313,804, 9.5%, (12.1% in 2004)\n* Discounted bills: 392,717, 11.9%, (8.4% in 2004)\n* Personal loans: 515,042, 15.7%, (13.1% in 2004)\n* Overseas business: 104,398, 3.2%, (2.7% in 2004)\n\n\nTotal: 3,289,553\n\n\n\n#### With collateralization[edit]\n\n\n* Secured by mortgages: 34.1%\n* Secured by other collateral: 22.1%\n* Guaranteed loans: 23.3%\n* Unsecured loans: 20.5%\n\n\n#### Non-performing[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of 2004, 19.1% of ICBC's portfolio consisted of non-performing loans.[58] To clean up ICBC's balance sheet and prepare it for overseas listing, the Chinese government orchestrated a series of capital injections, asset transfers, and government-subsidised bad loan disposals that eventually cost more than US$162 billion.[59] This included an approval for a cash injection of US$15 billion (financed from China's massive foreign exchange reserves) on 28 April 2005.[60] The Beijing-based state company, China Huarong Asset Management, helped ICBC dispose of its bad loans. As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks are typically around 1%).[61]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe company has 449,226 employees. There are 24 members of the board, with one chairman, one supervisory board chairman and one vice-chairman. Chen Siqing, the current chairman, assumed his role[62] after resigning in April 2019 from Bank of China, where he was the chair, executive director and chairman and participating board member within the Strategic Development Committee. Siqing had no disagreement with the Board at the time of his resignation, made purely for the reason of vocational change to ICBC.[63] Yi Huiman, the previous chairman, finished with the company to fulfil the position of chairman at the China Securities Regulatory Commission.[64]\n\n\nAs of 17 May 2020, the board is as stands:[65]\n\n\n\n* Chen Siqing (陈四清), chairman of ICBC, former Bank of China chairman[2]\n* Gu Shu, president of ICBC\n* Lu Yongzhen, former director on the National Development and Reform Commission\n* Zheng Fuqing, former Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China official\n* Mei Yingchun, former Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China and World Bank official\n* Feng Weidong, former secretary of the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China\n* Cao Liqun, former State Administration of Foreign Exchange official\n* Anthony Francis Neoh, former Hong Kong SEC chairman\n* Yang Siu Shun, former chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers Hong Kong\n* Shen Si, former executive director of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank\n* Nout Wellink, former president and chairman of De Nederlandsche Bank\n* Fred Zuliu Hu, former IMF and World Economic Forum official\n\n\n## Environmental policy and record[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008 ICBC was the first Chinese Bank to adopt the Equator Principles, an international set of social and environmental standards for financial institutions launched in 2003.[66] It has also adopted the Green Credit Policy launched in 2007 by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection.[67] International environmental groups have criticized ICBC for failing to adhere to its social environmental standards and of being hypocritical, because ICBC is involved in the financing of the controversial Gilgel Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia.[66]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n\n* ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia)\n* ICBC Standard Bank Plc\n* ICBC International Securities Limited\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Canada)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China USA NA\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Mexico)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Thai)\n* ICBC Turkey\n* ICBC Argentina\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Pakistan)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Zurich)\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, the Chinese government arrested several government officials in addition to bankers with regards to the accusation of a scheme to take illegally US$900 million from ICBC.[68]\n\n\nIn November 2015, ICBC Standard Bank, an overseas subsidiary acquired in February of that year, agreed to pay a fine of a maximum of $40 million to UK authorities.[69]\n\n\nOn 17 February 2016, the Spanish Guardia Civil supported by Europol, arrested six executives of the Spanish location of the bank accused of money-laundering.[70]\n\n\nIn 2018, the US Federal Reserve had found \"serious deficiencies\" of the bank, on, anti-money laundering protections.[71]\n\n\nOn 12 August 2021, a former senior banker at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Gu Guoming was sentenced to life in jail by Chinese authorities, after being found guilty of bribery.[72]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* *Forbes Global 2000* – the World's Largest Public Company[73][74]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chinese language version and transliteration here does not include the word \"Limited\", as shown within the introduction; c.f.

In 2015, CCB was the 2nd largest bank in the world by market capitalization and 6th largest company in the world.[3][4] The bank has approximately 13,629 domestic branches. In addition, it maintains overseas branches in London, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, New York City, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Santiago de Chile, Brisbane, Sydney and Auckland. Its total assets reached CN¥ 8.7 trillion in 2009,[5] and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. Its headquarters is in Xicheng District, Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Branch in Xinhui, Guangdong\nCCB was founded on 1 October 1954 under the name of People's Construction Bank of China (Chinese: 中国人民建设银行; pinyin: *Zhōngguó Rénmín Jiànshè Yínháng*), and later changed to China Construction Bank on 26 March 1996. It was established in order to focus on financing for investments, in the context of the People's Bank of China beginning to spin off its commercial banking functions.[7]: 225\n\n\nIn January 2002, CCB Chairman Wang Xuebing resigned from the bank after being charged with accepting bribes while he was employed with Bank of China; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In March 2005, his successor, Zhang Enzhao, resigned for \"personal reasons\". Just prior to his resignation, he had been charged in a lawsuit with accepting a US$1 million bribe. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail in connection with the case.[8][9]\n\n\nChina Construction Bank Corporation was formed as a joint-stock commercial bank in September 2004 as a result of a separation procedure undertaken by its predecessor, China Construction Bank, under the PRC Company Law. Following the China Banking Regulatory Committee's approval on 14 September 2004, the next day the bank (Jianyin) became a separate legal entity, owned by the Chinese government holding company, Central Huijin Investment Company or simply Huijin.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the China Construction Bank halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[10]\n\n\nIn 2015, China Construction Bank ranks the 2nd in *Forbes*’ 13th annual Global 2000 ranking of the biggest, most powerful and most valuable companies in the world.[11]\n\n\nIn 2021, China Construction Bank ranks the 3rd largest bank around the world in Forbes' 2021 Global 2000 list.[12] It ranks 5th in Forbes' 2022 Global 2000 list.\n\n\n\n## Investment by Bank of America[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3 billion. It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal.\n\n\nOn or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America now holds about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB's issued shares. Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB. Bank of America still has the option to purchase additional shares.[13]\n\n\nIn May 2009, speculation was raised that US$7.3 billion worth of CCB shares had been sold by BoA after being ordered to obtain more capital following the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test.[14]\n\n\nOn 29 August 2011, Bank of America announced it would sell approximately half its stake in CCB (13.1 billion shares worth about US$8.3 billion) to an undisclosed group of investors.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion.[16]\n\n\nIn June 2017, China Construction Bank (Malaysia) signs 13 Memorandum of Understandings on its opening day in Malaysia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, CCB acquired Bank of America (Asia), which started in 1912 in Hong Kong as Bank of Canton, and had a subsidiary in Macao.\n\n\nCCB opened a London office on 2 June 2009.\n\n\nIn 2008, CCB submitted an application to the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board to establish a branch in New York City.[17][18] CCB officially opened its New York branch on 6 June 2009.\n\n\nIn 2013, CCB opened its European Headquarters in Luxembourg.[19]\n\n\nIn 2016, CCB Indonesia was founded by the merger between two banks: Bank Windu Kentjana and Bank Anda.\n\n\n\n## Health fund[edit]\n\n\nChina Construction Bank investment division launched a CN¥5 billion (US$731.3 million) fund called **China Healthcare Investment Fund** to focus on investments in China's rapidly growing healthcare sector. The fund focuses on investments in healthcare related sectors including pharmacy, medical equipment manufacturing, medical institutions and services. It is the first domestic investment fund specializing in investments in China's healthcare industry.[20]\n\n\n\n## Stock exchanges listing[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2005, China Construction Bank made an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. In late 2007, it made China's second-largest initial public offering of CN¥57.12 billion (US$7.6 billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\n\nThe bank is a component of Hang Seng Index, SSE 180 Index and other indexes of Pan-Chinese and Pan-Asia stock exchanges, such as CSI 300 Index, Hang Seng China 50 Index, FTSE China A50 Index and S&P Asia 50.\n\n\nThe bank was also a component of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* *Global 2000 Rank #2* - World's Largest Public Companies in 2016[21]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Annual Report 2018\" (PDF).

It was founded on 10 July 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4] It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.\n\n\nABC has 320 million retail customers, 2.7 million corporate clients, and nearly 24,000 branches. It is China's third-largest lender by assets. ABC went public in mid-2010, fetching the world's biggest ever initial public offering (IPO) at the time,[5] since overtaken by the Saudi Arabian state-run petroleum enterprise, Saudi Aramco.[6] In 2011, it ranked eighth among the Top 1000 World Banks,[7] by 2015, it ranked third in Forbes' 13th annual Global 2000 list[8] and in 2017 it ranked fifth.[9] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC's focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.[10]: 225\n\n\nABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[11] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[12]\n\n\nIn April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at the Handan branch of the bank in Hebei province embezzled almost 51 million yuan (US$7.5 million).[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.[14][15]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[16]\n\n\n\n## 2010 initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\nABC raised US$19.21 billion in an IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai on July 6, 2010, before overallotment options were exercised.[21] On August 13, 2010, ABC officially completed the world's largest initial public offering, raising a total of $22.1 billion after both Shanghai and Hong Kong's over-allotments were fully exercised.[22][23] The IPO was once thought to be able to raise US$30 billion, but weaker market sentiment dampened the value.[24] Despite a 15-month low for the Chinese benchmark index, the IPO was said to have gone smoothly.[25]\n\n\nCICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley led the Hong Kong offering, with JPMorgan, Macquarie, Deutsche Bank and ABC's own securities unit also involved. CICC, CITIC Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities handled the Shanghai portion. ABC sold about 40% of the Shanghai offering to 27 strategic investors, including China Life Insurance and China State Construction. They were subject to lock-up periods of 12–18 months. Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n* Banking in China\n\t+ Policy banks\n\t+ List of banks in China\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Report 2018\".

It has been the second oldest bank in China still in existence after the Bank of Communications, founded in 1908. From its establishment until 1942, it issued banknotes on behalf of the Government along with the \"Big Four\" banks of the period: the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Central Bank of the Republic of China. After the People's Republic was established in 1949, it has become a national commercial and foreign exchange professional bank. Its original central bank designation was carried on by the newly formed People's Bank of China.[7]\n\n\nAs of 31 December 2019, it was the second-largest lender in China overall and ninth-largest bank in the world by market capitalization value,[8] and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. As of the end of 2020, it was the fourth-largest bank in the world in terms of total assets, ranked after the other three Chinese banks.[9]\n\n\nThe Bank of China is legally separate from its subsidiary the Bank of China (Hong Kong), although they maintain close relations in management and administration and co-operate in several areas including reselling BOC's insurance and securities services.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Bank of China's history began in 1905, when the Qing government established *Daqing Hubu* Bank[10] (大淸戶部銀行) in Beijing, which was in 1908 renamed to *Daqing* Bank (大淸銀行). When the Republic of China was established in 1912, Chen Jintao was named head of financial reform in President Sun Yat-sen's government. Chen Jintao transformed the bank into the Bank of China, becoming its founder.[11][12][13][14]\n\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, the Bank of China effectively split into two operations. Part of the bank relocated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang (KMT) government, and was privatized in 1971 to become the **International Commercial Bank of China** (中國國際商業銀行). As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial functions starting in 1978, the Bank of China became focused on international finance.[15]: 225 In 2002, it merged with Jiaotong Bank (交通銀行) to become the Mega International Commercial Bank. The Mainland operation is the current entity known as the Bank of China.\n\n\nIt is the second largest lender in China overall, and the fifth largest bank in the world by market capitalization value.[8] Once 100% owned by the central government, via China Central Huijin and National Council for Social Security Fund (SSF), an Initial public offering (IPO) of its shares took place in June 2006, the free float is at present over 26%. In the *Forbes* Global 2000 it ranked as the 4th-largest company in the world.[16]\n\n\nIt is the most globally-active of China's banks, with branches on every inhabited continent. Outside of mainland China, BOC also operates in 27 countries and areas including Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, Hungary, United States, Panama, Brazil, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Bahrain, Zambia, South Africa, and a branch office in the Cayman Islands.[17] In December 2010, the Bank of China New York branch began offering renminbi products for Americans.[18] It was the first major Chinese bank to offer such a product.\n\n\nAlthough it is present in the above countries/territories, its operations outside China accounted for less than 4% of the activity of the bank by both profits and assets. Mainland China accounts for 60% of the bank by profits and 76% by assets as at December 2005.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Timeline of overseas activities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Two-thirds of its share capital are in free float. The bank's headquarters in Hong Kong are located in the Bank of China Tower, designed by the renowned architect I.M. Pei, and was opened to the public in 1990 as the tallest building in Hong Kong at that time.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (independently from BOCHK) (SEHK:3988) by floating the largest initial public offering (IPO) in the world by any institution since 2000 on June 1, 2006, raising US$9.7 billion. The IPO attracted HK$286 billion (US$36.7 billion) in retail orders and was the most heavily oversubscribed in the history of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The offer was around 76 times oversubscribed. Although some financial analysts advised caution due to the worrying amounts of non-performing loans, this hardly deterred investors. The IPO share price started at HK$2.95 per share and jumped 15% (to HK$3.40) after the first day of trading.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Bank of China was crowned Deal of the Year - Debt Market Deal of the Year at the 2008 ALB Hong Kong Law Awards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBank of China (Canada)| ![](image)Bank of China (Canada) headquarters\n |\n| Company type | Subsidiary |\n| Industry | Bank |\n| Predecessor | Bank of China Toronto Representative Office |\n| Founded | May 18, 1993[39] |\n| Headquarters | 50 Minthorn BoulevardMarkham, Ontario\n, Canada\n |\n| Areas served\n | * Ontario\n* British Columbia\n* Alberta\n |\n| Revenue | 473,912,000,000 renminbi (2015) ![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Operating income\n | 229,237,000,000 renminbi (2015) ![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Net income\n | 179,417,000,000 renminbi (2015) ![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Total assets | 16,815,597,000,000 renminbi (2015) ![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Number of employees\n | 310,042 (2015) ![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Parent | Bank of China |\n| Website | www.bankofchina.com/ca |\n\n\n![](image)A branch located in Toronto's Chinatown\n**Bank of China (Canada)**, commonly known as **BOCC**, is the Canadian subsidiary of the Bank of China (BOC). The Bank of China began its business in Canada by opening a representative office in Toronto on September 8, 1992. BOCC was incorporated as a subsidiary of BOC in 1993 under Schedule II of the Bank Act.[39] BOCC provides the following types of banking services in Canada: bank accounts to both personal and commercial banking clients, remittance services (including bank drafts and wire transfers), loans and mortgages, foreign exchange services, and China visa application assistance services where by it acts as agent, however plans for a China Visa Application Centre are being made and it is anticipated that the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Toronto will entrust all future China Visa applications to Bank of China Canada's Visa Application Centre.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Canada, BOCC has ten locations located in Markham, Toronto (several branches, in downtown, North York and Scarborough], Mississauga, Vancouver, Montreal, and Calgary. It previously had branches in Burnaby and Richmond. As well, the bank is a member of the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA); registered member with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), a federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada's chartered banks; and, a member of Interac, which handles transactions between automated teller machines of different banks and debit card transactions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Banknotes[edit]\n\n\nAlthough it is not a central bank, the Bank of China is licensed to issue banknotes in two of China's Special Administrative Regions. Until 1942, the Bank of China issued banknotes in mainland China on behalf of the Government of the Republic of China. Today, the Bank issues banknotes in Hong Kong and banknotes in Macau (under the Portuguese name *\"Banco da China, Sucursal de Macau\"*), along with other commercial banks in those regions.\n\n\n\n## Ownership[edit]\n\n\nAs of 30 September 2015, largest shareholders of the Bank of China ordinary shares (both A shares and H shares) were:[40]\n\n\n\n* China Central Huijin (an investment arm of the government of the People's Republic of China): 64.63% (A shares)\n* HKSCC Nominees Limited (nominee account): 27.78% (H shares)\n* China Securities Finance (state-owned legal person): 2.90% (A shares)\n\n\nAs of 30 September 2015, largest shareholders of the Bank of China preference shares (both domestic and offshore) were:[41]\n\n\n\n* The Bank of New York Mellon (custodian bank): 39.96% (offshore)\n* China Mobile Communications: 18.01% (domestic)\n* China National Tobacco Corporation: 5.00% (domestic)\n* Zhongwei Real Estate: 3.00% (domestic)\n\n\n## Leaders[edit]\n\n\n### Current Chairman[edit]\n\n\nLiu Liange (刘连舸), President and vice-chairman of the board from 2015 to March 2023.[42]\n\n\n\n### Past Chairman[edit]\n\n\nChen Siqing (zh:陈四清), former president and chairman, current chairman of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.[43]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Guarantee scandal in Poland[edit]\n\n\nAfter COVEC withdrew from completing its construction of the A2 highway in Poland, Bank of China was to pay a performance guarantee to the Polish government's road organization GDDKiA. However, with Export-Import Bank of China, they refused to pay this; only Deutsche Bank honoured its obligations under the court decision.[44]\n\n\n\n### Wultz v. Bank of China[edit]\n\n\nOn August 8, 2008, the family of Daniel Wultz, an American teenager killed in a 2006 terrorist attack in Israel, filed suit against the Bank of China in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, where litigation continues. On October 29, 2012, the Honorable J. Scheindlin issued a ruling compelling Bank of China to provide discovery.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Alleged money transfers to Hamas[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, the families of eight terror victims of the 2008 Mercaz HaRav massacre in Jerusalem filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the Bank of China. The suit asserted that in 2003 the bank's New York branch wired millions of dollars to Hamas from its leadership in Syria and Iran. The Bank of China subsequently denied providing banking services to terrorist groups: \"The Bank of China has always strictly followed the UN's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements and regulations in China and other judicial areas where we operate.\"[48][49][50]\n\n\n\n### Money laundering[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014 BOC denied China Central Television reports of money laundering.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of largest banks\n* List of asset management companies of the People's Republic of China\n* Foreign exchange reserves of the People's Republic of China\n* BOC Aviation - Singapore-based aircraft leasing company owned by BOC\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Corporate Information, Bank of China, https://pic.bankofchina.com/bocappd/report/201104/P020110427563098317418.pdf Archived 2021-05-09 at the Wayback Machine\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Report 2018\" (PDF).

It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves. The firm is headquartered at 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building at 270 Park Avenue in 2025.\n\n\nThe firm's early history can be traced to 1799, with the founding of what became the Chase Manhattan Company. In 1871, J.P. Morgan & Co. was founded by J. P. Morgan who launched the House of Morgan on 23 Wall Street as a national purveyor of commercial, investment, and private banking services. The present company was formed after the two predecessor firms merged in 2000, creating a diversified holding entity. It is a major provider of investment banking services, through corporate advisory, mergers and acquisitions, sales and trading, and public offerings. Their private banking franchise and asset management division are among the world's largest in terms of total assets. Its retail banking and credit card offerings are provided via the Chase brand in the U.S. and United Kingdom.\n\n\nWith US $3.9 trillion in total assets,[8] JPMorgan Chase is the fifth-largest bank in the world by assets. The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The JPMorgan Chase logo prior to the 2008 rebranding\n![](image)As of June 2008, the JPMorgan logo used for the company's Investment Banking, Asset Management, and Treasury & Securities Services units[11]\nJPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies that merged since 1996, combining Chase Manhattan Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., and Bank One, as well as asset assumptions of Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and First Republic. Predecessors include additional historic, major banking firms, among which are Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago Bank, National Bank of Detroit, Texas Commerce Bank, Providian Financial and Great Western Bank. The company's oldest predecessor institution, The Bank of the Manhattan Company, was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799, by Aaron Burr.[12]\n\n\n\n### Chase Manhattan Bank[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chase Manhattan Bank\n\n![](image)The logo used by Chase following the merger with the Manhattan Bank in 1954\nThe Chase Manhattan Bank was formed upon the 1955 purchase of Chase National Bank (established in 1877) by The Bank of the Manhattan Company (established in 1799),[13] the company's oldest predecessor institution. The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of Aaron Burr, who transformed the company from a water carrier into a bank.[14]\n\n\nAccording to page 115 of *An Empire of Wealth* by John Steele Gordon, the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase's history runs as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> At the turn of the nineteenth century, obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature. This, of course, injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. Hamilton's political enemy—and eventual murderer—Aaron Burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called The Manhattan Company to provide clean water to New York City. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States.[15]\n> \n> \n\n\nLed by David Rockefeller during the 1970s and 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banks, with leadership positions in syndicated lending, treasury and securities services, credit cards, mortgages, and retail financial services. Weakened by the real estate collapse in the early 1990s, it was acquired by Chemical Bank in 1996, retaining the Chase name.[16][17] Before its merger with J.P. Morgan & Co., the new Chase expanded the investment and asset management groups through two acquisitions. In 1999, it acquired San Francisco–based Hambrecht & Quist for $1.35 billion.[18] In April 2000, UK-based Robert Fleming & Co. was purchased by the new Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7 billion.[19]\n\n\n\n### Chemical Banking Corporation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chemical Bank\n\nThe New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of various chemicals. In 1824, the company amended its charter to perform banking activities and created the Chemical Bank of New York. After 1851, the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, most notably with Corn Exchange Bank in 1954, Texas Commerce Bank (a large bank in Texas) in 1986, and Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company in 1991 (the first major bank merger \"among equals\"). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions. In 1984, Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity transactions alongside various financial sponsors. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of the pioneering investment banker, Jimmy Lee.[20][21] At many points throughout this history, Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of assets or deposit market share).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1996, Chemical Bank acquired Chase Manhattan. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, it took the better-known Chase name.[16][17] To this day, JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical's pre-1996 stock price history, as well as Chemical's former headquarters site at 270 Park Avenue (the current building was demolished and a larger replacement headquarters is being built on the same site).\n\n\n\n### J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: J.P. Morgan & Co.\n\n![](image)The J.P. Morgan & Co. logo before its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000\n![](image)Influence of J.P. Morgan in Large Corporations, 1914\n![](image)The J.P. Morgan headquarters in New York City following the September 16, 1920, bomb explosion that took the lives of 38 people and injured over 400 more\nThe House of Morgan was born out of the partnership of Drexel, Morgan & Co., which in 1895 was renamed J.P. Morgan & Co. (see also: J. Pierpont Morgan).[22] J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion dollar corporation.[23] In 1895, J.P. Morgan & Co. supplied the United States government with $62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100 million.[24] In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.[25]\n\n\nBuilt in 1914, 23 Wall Street was the bank's headquarters for decades.[26] On September 16, 1920, a terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank, injuring 400 and killing 38.[27] Shortly before the bomb went off, a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The case has never been solved, and was rendered inactive by the FBI in 1940.[28]\n\n\nIn August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the monopoly underwriter of war bonds for the UK and France. The Bank of England became a \"fiscal agent\" of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa.[29] The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France. The company profited from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.[29] Since the U.S. federal government withdrew from world affairs under successive isolationist Republican administrations in the 1920s, J.P. Morgan & Co. continued playing a major role in global affairs since most European countries still owed war debts.[30]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, J.P. Morgan & Co. and all integrated banking businesses in the United States were required by the provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act to separate their investment banking from their commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank.[31]\n\n\nIn 1935, after being barred from the securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan spun off its investment-banking operations. Led by J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, Morgan Stanley was founded on September 16, 1935, with $6.6 million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners.[*better source needed*] In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.[22] The bank would continue to operate as Morgan Guaranty Trust until the 1980s, before migrating back to the use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1984, the group purchased the Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette, Indiana. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.[32]\n\n\nThe Bank began operations in Japan in 1924,[33] in Australia during the later part of the nineteenth century,[34] and in Indonesia during the early 1920s.[35] An office of the Equitable Eastern Banking Corporation (one of J.P. Morgan's predecessors) opened a branch in China in 1921 and Chase National Bank was established there in 1923.[36] The bank has operated in Saudi Arabia[37] and India[38] since the 1930s. Chase Manhattan Bank opened an office in South Korea in 1967.[39] The firm's presence in Greece dates to 1968.[40] An office of JPMorgan was opened in Taiwan in 1970,[41] in Russia (Soviet Union) in 1973,[42] and Nordic operations began during the same year.[43] Operations in Poland began in 1995.[40]\n\n\n\n### Bank One Corporation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bank One Corporation\n\n![](image)Logo of Bank One\nIn 2004, JPMorgan Chase merged with Chicago-based Bank One Corp., bringing on board current chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon as president and COO.[44] He succeeded former CEO William B. Harrison Jr.[45] Dimon introduced new cost-cutting strategies, and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executives—many of whom were with Dimon at Citigroup. Dimon became CEO in December 2005 and chairman in December 2006.[46] Bank One Corporation was formed with the 1998 merger of Banc One of Columbus, Ohio and First Chicago NBD.[47] This merger was considered a failure until Dimon took over and reformed the new firm's practices. Dimon effected changes to make Bank One Corporation a viable merger partner for JPMorgan Chase.[48]\n\n\nBank One Corporation, formerly First Bancgroup of Ohio, was founded as a holding company for City National Bank of Columbus, Ohio, and several other banks in that state, all of which were renamed \"Bank One\" when the holding company was renamed Banc One Corporation.[49] With the beginning of interstate banking they spread into other states, always renaming acquired banks \"Bank One.\" After the First Chicago NBD merger, adverse financial results led to the departure of CEO John B. McCoy, whose father and grandfather had headed Banc One and predecessors. JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of Bank One in the third quarter of 2004.[49]\n\n\n\n### Bear Stearns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bear Stearns\n\n![](image)The Bear Stearns logo\nAt the end of 2007, Bear Stearns was the fifth largest investment bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of the year.[50] On Friday, March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns lost 47% of its equity market value as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend, it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove insolvent, and on March 15, 2008, the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns.[51]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2008, after a weekend of intense negotiations between JPMorgan, Bear, and the federal government, JPMorgan Chase announced its plans to acquire Bear Stearns in a stock swap worth $2.00 per share or $240 million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days.[51] In the interim, JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all Bear Stearns trades and business process flows.[52] On March 18, 2008, JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of Bear Stearns for $236 million.[50] The stock swap agreement was signed that night.[53]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2008, after public discontent over the low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share.[50] Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns using newly issued shares at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board, representing another 10% of the share capital, that its members would vote in favor of the new deal. With sufficient commitments to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on May 30, 2008.[54]\n\n\n\n### Washington Mutual[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Washington Mutual\n\n![](image)The Washington Mutual logo prior to its 2008 acquisition by JPMorgan Chase\nOn September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most of the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That night, the Office of Thrift Supervision, in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations, and deposits to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $1.836 billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. \n\n\nHowever, Chase did not purchase any mortgages in the FDIC receivership as the loans had already been sold off into Washington Mutual-branded mortgage-backed securities long before the receivership happened on September 25, 2008. If Chase wanted ownership of any Washington Mutual mortgages, they had to purchase them from the FDIC by way of a Receiver's Deed or Bill of Sale. This could not occur, as there were no mortgages on Washington Mutual Bank's books at time of receivership. Any recorded Assignments of Mortgage claiming that Chase was \"successor in interest\" and that the transfer occurred \"by operation of law,\" would be incorrect. The FDIC was \"successor in interest\" to Washington Mutual Bank. Chase's purchase of the bank from the FDIC was for Washington Mutual Bank only and it occurred by a Purchase & Assumption Agreement[55] and not \"by operation of law\" from the receivership.\n\n\nAs a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their equity.[56]\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase raised $10 billion in a stock sale to cover writedowns and losses after taking on deposits and branches of Washington Mutual.[57] Through the acquisition, JPMorgan now owns the former accounts of Providian Financial, a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005. The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009.[*citation needed*] Chief executive Alan H. Fishman received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million after being CEO for 17 days.[58][*importance?*]\n\n\n\n### First Republic Bank[edit]\n\n\nMain article: First Republic Bank\n\nOn May 1, 2023, in what was now the second largest bank failure behind JPMorgan's acquisition of Washington Mutual fifteen years earlier, the company acquired \"the substantial majority of assets\" and inherited the deposits of First Republic Bank. Under terms disclosed by JPMorgan Chase & Co., it will make a $10.6 billion payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, return $25 billion in funds that other banks deposited with First Republic in March in a lifeline negotiated with the US Department of Treasury at that time, and will eliminate a $5 billion deposit it had made with First Republic.[59] As a result of the takeover, First Republic Bank shareholders lost all their equity.\n\n\nThe FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be about $13 billion.[60]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, JPMorgan Chase purchased Collegiate Funding Services, a portfolio company of private equity firm Lightyear Capital, for $663 million. CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans, previously known as Chase Education Finance.[61]\n\n\nIn April 2006, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bank of New York Mellon's retail and small business banking network. The acquisition gave Chase access to 339 additional branches in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.[62] In 2008, J.P. Morgan acquired the UK-based carbon offsetting company ClimateCare.[63] JPMorgan Chase was the biggest bank at the end of 2008 as an individual bank (exclusive of its subsidiaries) during the 2008 financial crisis.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 2008–2009[edit]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2008, $25 billion in funds were transferred from the U.S. Treasury Department to JPMorgan Chase, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[65] This was the fifth largest amount transferred under Section A of TARP[66] to help troubled assets related to residential mortgages. It has been widely reported[67] that JPMorgan Chase was in much better financial shape than other banks and did not need TARP funds but accepted the funds because the government did not want to single out only the banks with capital issues. JPMorgan Chase stated in February 2009 that it would be using its capital-base monetary strength to acquire new businesses.[68]\n\n\nBy February 2009, the U.S. government had not moved forward in enforcing TARP's intent of funding JPMorgan Chase with $25 billion.[65] In the face of the government's lack of action, Jamie Dimon was quoted during the week of February 1, 2009, as saying:\n\n\n\n\n> JPMorgan would be fine if we stopped talking about the damn nationalization of banks. We've got plenty of capital. To policymakers, I say where were they? ... They approved all these banks. Now they're beating up on everyone, saying look at all these mistakes, and we're going to come and fix it.[69][70]\n> \n> \n\n\nJPMorgan Chase was arguably the healthiest of the nine largest U.S. banks and did not need to take TARP funds. In order to encourage smaller banks with troubled assets to accept this money, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson allegedly coerced the CEOs of the nine largest banks to accept TARP money under short notice.[71]\n\n\nIn November 2009, J.P. Morgan announced it would acquire the balance of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, an advisory and underwriting joint venture established in 2004 with the Cazenove Group.[72] Earlier in 2011, the company announced that by the use of field-programmable gate array-based supercomputers, the time taken to assess risk had been greatly reduced, from arriving at a conclusion within hours to what is now minutes.[73] In 2013, J.P. Morgan acquired Bloomspot, a San Francisco-based startup. Shortly after the acquisition, the service was shut down and Bloomspot's talent was left unused.[74][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2013[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, after teaming up with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline and Children's Investment Fund, JPMorgan Chase, under Dimon launched a $94 Million fund with a focus on \"late-stage healthcare technology trials\". The \"$94 million Global Health Investment Fund will give money to final-stage drug, vaccine, and medical device studies that are otherwise stalled at companies because of their relatively high failure risk and low consumer demand. Examples of problems that could be addressed by the fund include malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and maternal and infant mortality, according to the Gates and JPMorgan Chase led-group\".[76]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nThe 2014 JPMorgan Chase data breach, disclosed in September 2014, compromised the JPMorgan Chase accounts of over 83 million customers. The attack was discovered by the bank's security team in late July 2014, but not completely halted until the middle of August.[77][78]\n\n\nIn October 2014, J.P. Morgan sold its commodities trader unit to Mercuria for $800 million, a quarter of the initial valuation of $3.5 billion, as the transaction excluded some oil and metal stockpiles and other assets.[79]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2016, J.P. Morgan decided not to finance coal mines and coal power plants in wealthy countries.[80] In December 2016, 14 former executives of the Wendel investment company faced trial for tax fraud while JPMorgan Chase was to be pursued for complicity. Jean-Bernard Lafonta was convicted December 2015 for spreading false information and insider trading, and fined 1.5 million euros.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Lawrence Obracanik, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. employee, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that he stole more than $5 million from his employer to pay personal debts.[82] In June 2017, Matt Zames, then-COO of the bank, decided to leave the firm.[83] In December 2017, J.P. Morgan was sued by the Nigerian government for $875 million, which Nigeria alleges was transferred by J.P. Morgan to a corrupt former minister.[84] Nigeria accused J.P. Morgan of being \"grossly negligent\".[85]\n\n\n\n#### 2019[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, J.P. Morgan announced the launch of JPM Coin, a digital token that will be used to settle transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business.[86] It would be the first cryptocurrency issued by a United States bank.[87]\n\n\n\n#### 2021[edit]\n\n\nOn April 19, 2021, JP Morgan pledged $5 billion towards the European Super League.[88][89] a controversial breakaway group of football clubs seeking to create a monopolistic structure where the founding members would be guaranteed entry to the competition in perpetuity. They funded the failed attempt to create the league, which, if successful, would have ended the meritocratic European pyramid soccer system. J.P. Morgan's role in the creation of the Super League was instrumental; the investment bank was reported to have worked on it for several years.[90] After a strong backlash, the owners/management of the teams that proposed creating the league pulled out of it.[91] After the attempt to end the European football hierarchy failed, J.P. Morgan apologized for its role in the scheme.[90] JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the company \"kind of missed\" that football supporters would respond negatively to the Super League.[92] While the absence of promotion and relegation is a common sports model in the US, this is an antithesis to the European competition-based pyramid model and has led to widespread condemnation from Football federations internationally as well as at government level.[93] However, even at the time, JPMorgan had been involved in European football for almost 20 years. In 2003, they advised the Glazer ownership of Manchester United. It also advised Rocco Commisso, the owner of Mediacom, to purchase ACF Fiorentina, and Dan Friedkin on his takeover of A.S. Roma. Moreover, It aided Inter Milan and A.S. Roma to sell bonds backed by future media revenue, and Spain's Real Madrid CF to raise funds to refurbish their Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.[94]\n\n\nIn September 2021, JPMorgan Chase entered the UK retail banking market by launched an app-based current account under the Chase brand. This is the company's first retail banking operation outside of the United States.[95][96][97] In 2021, the company made more than over 30 acquisitions including OpenInvest and Nutmeg.[98][99] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that would acquire Global Shares, a cloud-based provider of share plan software management.[100][101] In November 2021, JPMorgan Chase acquired restaurant recommendation website and owner of Zagat, The Infatuation.[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, JPMorgan Chase was ranked 24 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue.[104] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced to wind down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.[105]\n\n\nOn May 20, 2022, JPMorgan Chase used blockchain for collateral settlements, the latest Wall Street experimentation with the technology in the trading of traditional financial assets.[106]\n\n\nIn September 2022, the company announced it was acquiring California-based Renovite Technologies to expand its payments processing business amid heavy competition from fintech firms like Stripe and Adyen. This comes on top of previous, similar moves of buying a 49% stake in fintech Viva Wallet and a majority sake in Volkswagen's payments business, among many other acquisitions in other areas of finance.[107][108][109]\n\n\nIn November 2022, JPMorgan Chase sent COO Daniel Pinto to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong.[110] The attendance of US financial executives drew heavy criticism from some US lawmakers, who had previously urged the US financial executives to cancel their attendance to the summit.[111][112]\n\n\n\n#### 2023[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2023, *CNBC* reported JPMorgan Chase was developing a new tool for investment advisers using artificial intelligence called IndexGPT. Via trademark filing, this would rely on a \"disruptive form of artificial intelligence\" and cloud computing software to select investments for customers. This move was a sign the bank intended to launch a product in the near term, given the requirements around filing, and it came amid a flurry of development around ChatGPT and this technology from financial institutions. This came amid a period of job cuts, including for technology roles, even as the company emphasize its commitment to AI and created a model to detect potential changes in Federal Reserve policy.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and legal settlements by years[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### 2001[edit]\n\n\nChase paid out over $2 billion in fines and legal settlements for their role in financing Enron Corporation with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.'s securities fraud, which collapsed amid a financial scandal in 2001.[117] In 2003, Chase paid $160 million in fines and penalties to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan district attorney's office. In 2005, Chase paid $2.2 billion to settle a lawsuit filed by investors in Enron.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2002[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2002, Chase paid fines totaling $80 million, with the amount split between the states and the federal government. The fines were part of a settlement involving charges that ten banks, including Chase, deceived investors with biased research. The total settlement with the ten banks was $1.4 billion. The settlement required that the banks separate investment banking from research, and ban any allocation of IPO shares.[119]\n\n\n\n### 2005[edit]\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase, which helped underwrite $15.4 billion of WorldCom's bonds, agreed in March 2005 to pay $2 billion; that was 46 percent, or $630 million, more than it would have paid had it accepted an investor offer in May 2004 of $1.37 billion. J.P. Morgan was the last big lender to settle. Its payment is the second largest in the case, exceeded only by the $2.6 billion accord reached in 2004 by Citigroup.[120] In March 2005, 16 of WorldCom's 17 former underwriters reached settlements with the investors.[121][122] In 2005, JPMorgan Chase acknowledged that its two predecessor banks had received ownership of thousands of slaves as collateral prior to the Civil War. The company apologized for contributing to the \"brutal and unjust institution\" of slavery.[123][124] The bank paid $5 million in reparations in the form of a scholarship program for Black students.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n### 2009[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, 14 lawsuits were filed against JPMorgan Chase in various district courts on behalf of Chase credit card holders claiming the bank violated the Truth in Lending Act, breached its contract with the consumers, and committed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The consumers contended that Chase, with little or no notice, increased minimum monthly payments from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based on the promise of a fixed interest rate. In May 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.[128]\n\n\nIn November 2009, a week after Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Larry Langford was convicted for financial crimes related to bond swaps for Jefferson County, Alabama,[*importance?*] JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to a $722 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe into the sales of derivatives that allegedly contributed to the near-bankruptcy of the county. JPMorgan had been chosen by the county commissioners to refinance the county's sewer debt, and the SEC had alleged that JPMorgan made undisclosed payments to close friends of the commissioners in exchange for the deal and made up for the costs by charging higher interest rates on the swaps.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2010[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, J.P. Morgan Securities was fined a record £33.32 million ($49.12 million) by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) for failing to protect an average of £5.5 billion of clients' money from 2002 to 2009.[130][131] FSA requires financial firms to keep clients' funds in separate accounts to protect the clients in case such a firm becomes insolvent. The firm had failed to properly segregate client funds from corporate funds following the merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan, resulting in a violation of FSA regulations but no losses to clients. The clients' funds would have been at risk had the firm become insolvent during this period.[132] J.P. Morgan Securities reported the incident to the FSA, corrected the errors, and cooperated in the ensuing investigation, resulting in the fine being reduced 30% from an original amount of £47.6 million.[131]\n\n\n\n### 2011[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, JPMorgan Chase admitted that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed on more than a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active-duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was \"grim\" and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back.[133] Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27 million in compensation to settle the class-action suit.[134] At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed. In June 2011, lending chief Dave Lowman was forced out over the scandal.[135][136]\n\n\nOn August 25, 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to settle fines with regard to violations of the sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regime.[*undue weight? – discuss*] The U.S. Department of Treasury released the following civil penalties information under the heading: \"JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Settles Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs\":[*importance?*]\n\n\n\n\n> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, New York, NY (\"JPMC\") has agreed to remit $88,300,000 to settle a potential civil liability for apparent violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (\"CACR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 515; the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations (\"WMDPSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 544; Executive Order 13382, \"Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters;\" the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (\"GTSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 594; the Iranian Transactions Regulations (\"ITR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 560; the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations (\"SSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 538; the Former Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor Sanctions Regulations (\"FLRCTSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 593; and the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations (\"RPPR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 501, that occurred between December 15, 2005, and March 1, 2011.\n> \n> — U.S. Department of the Treasury Resource Center, OFAC Recent Actions. Retrieved June 18, 2013.[137]\n> \n\n\n### 2012[edit]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[138] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[139] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.\n\n\nIn 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co was charged for misrepresenting and failing to disclose that the CIO had engaged in speculative trades that exposed JPMorgan to significant losses.[140]\n\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2013, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a stipulation and consent agreement under which JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation (JPMVEC), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to pay $410 million in penalties and disgorgement to ratepayers for allegations of market manipulation stemming from the company's bidding activities in electricity markets in California and the Midwest from September 2010 through November 2012.[*undue weight? – discuss*] JPMVEC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $285 million to the U.S. Treasury and to disgorge $125 million in unjust profits. JPMVEC admitted the facts set forth in the agreement, but neither admitted nor denied the violations.[141] The case stemmed from multiple referrals to FERC from market monitors in 2011 and 2012 regarding JPMVEC's bidding practices. FERC investigators determined that JPMVEC engaged in 12 manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants that were usually out of the money in the marketplace. In each of them, the company made bids designed to create artificial conditions that forced California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (ISOs) to pay JPMVEC outside the market at premium rates.[141] FERC investigators further determined that JPMVEC knew that the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO received no benefit from making inflated payments to the company, thereby defrauding the ISOs by obtaining payments for benefits that the company did not deliver beyond the routine provision of energy. FERC investigators also determined that JPMVEC's bids displaced other generation and altered day ahead and real-time prices from the prices that would have resulted had the company not submitted the bids.[141] Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed FERC to detect, prevent, and appropriately sanction the gaming of energy markets. According to FERC, the Commission approved the settlement as in the public interest.[141]\n\n\nFERC's investigation of energy market manipulations led to a subsequent investigation into possible obstruction of justice by employees of JPMorgan Chase.[142] Various newspapers reported in September 2013 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Attorney's Office in Manhattan were investigating whether employees withheld information or made false statements during the FERC investigation.[142] The reported impetus for the investigation was a letter from Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, in which they asked FERC why no action was taken against people who impeded the FERC investigation.[142] At the time of the FBI investigation, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was also looking into whether JPMorgan Chase employees impeded the FERC investigation.[142] Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase was facing over a dozen investigations at the time.[142]\n\n\nBernie Madoff opened a business account at Chemical Bank in 1986 and maintained it until 2008, long after Chemical acquired Chase.[*undue weight? – discuss*] In 2010, Irving Picard, the SIPC receiver appointed to liquidate Madoff's company, alleged that JPMorgan Chase failed to prevent Madoff from defrauding his customers. According to the suit, Chase \"knew or should have known\" that Madoff's wealth management business was a fraud. However, Chase did not report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it notified the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency. Picard argued that even after Morgan's investment bankers reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, Chase's retail banking division did not put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.[143] The receiver's suit against JPMorgan Chase was dismissed by the Court for failing to set forth any legally cognizable claim for damages.[144] In the fall of 2013, JPMorgan Chase began talks with prosecutors and regulators regarding compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer banking regulations in connection with Madoff.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn August 2013, JPMorgan Chase announced that it was being investigated by the United States Department of Justice over its offerings of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis of 2007–08. The company said that the Department of Justice had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during the period 2005 to 2007.[145] On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities.[146] Of that amount, $9 billion was penalties and fines, and the remaining $4 billion was consumer relief. This was the largest corporate settlement to date. Conduct at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to their 2008 acquisitions accounted for much of the alleged wrongdoing. The agreement did not settle criminal charges.[147]\n\n\n\n### 2014[edit]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2014, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $2.05 billion in fines and penalties to settle civil and criminal charges related to its role in the Madoff scandal.[*undue weight? – discuss*] The government filed a two-count criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase with Bank Secrecy Act violations, but the charges would be dismissed within two years provided that JPMorgan Chase reforms its anti-money laundering procedures and cooperates with the government in its investigation. The bank agreed to forfeit $1.7 billion. The lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of shareholders against chief executive Jamie Dimon and other high-ranking JPMorgan Chase employees, used statements made by Bernie Madoff during interviews conducted while in prison in Butner, North Carolina claiming that JPMorgan Chase officials knew of the fraud. The lawsuit stated that \"JPMorgan was uniquely positioned for 20 years to see Madoff's crimes and put a stop to them ... But faced with the prospect of shutting down Madoff's account and losing lucrative profits, JPMorgan – at its highest level – chose to turn a blind eye.\"[148][*neutrality is disputed*] JPMorgan Chase also agreed to pay a $350 million fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and settle the suit filed against it by Picard for $543 million.[149][150][151][152]\n\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $264 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges involving a systematic bribery scheme spanning 2006 to 2013 in which the bank secured business deals in Hong Kong by agreeing to hire hundreds of friends and relatives of Chinese government officials, resulting in more than $100 million in revenue for the bank.[153]\n\n\n\n### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, the United States sued the company, accusing it of discriminating against \"thousands\" of black and Hispanic mortgage borrowers between 2006 and at least 2009.[154][155]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nOn December 26, 2018, as part of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into abusive practices related to American depositary receipts (ADRs), JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $135 million to settle charges of improper handling of \"pre-released\" ADRs without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. The sum consisted of $71 million in ill-gotten gains plus $14.4 million in prejudgment interest and an additional penalty of $49.7 million.[156]\n\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\nOn May 14, 2020, *Financial Times*, citing a report which revealed how companies are treating employees, their supply chains and other stakeholders, during the COVID-19 pandemic, documented that J.P. Morgan Asset Management alongside Fidelity Investments and Vanguard have been accused of paying lip services to cover human rights violations. The UK based media also referenced that a few of the world's biggest fund houses took the action in order to lessen the impact of abuses, such as modern slavery, at the companies they invest in. J.P. Morgan, in responding to the report, said that it took \"human rights violations very seriously\" and \"any company with alleged or proven violations of principles, including human rights abuses, is scrutinized and may result in either enhanced engagement or removal from a portfolio.\"[157]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the company admitted that it manipulated precious metals futures and government bond markets in a span period of eight years. It settled with the United States Department of Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for $920 million. J.P. Morgan will not face criminal charges, however, it will launch into a deferred prosecution agreement for three years.[158]\n\n\n\n### 2022–2023[edit]\n\n\nOn November 24, 2022, two women who accused Jeffrey Epstein of sex trafficking and sexual abuse also sued JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, accusing them of benefiting and closing their eyes to Epstein's sex trafficking operations. According to the lawsuits, banks knew that Epstein's accounts were used to finance sex trafficking crimes.[159][160] In June 2023, after the allegations reached class-action status, the parties reached a settlement, with JPMorgan agreeing to pay $290 million.[161]\n\n\nIn September 2023, JPMorgan agreed to a $75 million settlement with the United States Virgin Islands Department of Justice for its alleged facilitation and failure to notify law enforcement of Epstein's illegal activities.[162]\n\n\n\n## Financial data[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | 25.87 | 31.15 | 33.19 | 29.34 | 29.61 | 33.19 | 42.74 | 54.25 | 62.00 | 71.37 | 67.25 | 100.4 | 102.7 | 97.23 | 97.03 | 96.61 | 94.21 | 93.54 | 95.67 | 99.62 | 109.03 | 115.40 | 119.54 | 121.65 | 128.69\n |\n| Net income | 4.745 | 7.501 | 5.727 | 1.694 | 1.663 | 6.719 | 4.466 | 8.483 | 14.44 | 15.37 | 5.605 | 11.73 | 17.37 | 18.98 | 21.28 | 17.92 | 21.76 | 24.44 | 24.73 | 24.44 | 32.47 | 36.43 | 29.13 | 48.33 | 37.68\n |\n| Assets | 626.9 | 667.0 | 715.3 | 693.6 | 758.8 | 770.9 | 1,157 | 1,199 | 1,352 | 1,562 | 2,175 | 2,032 | 2,118 | 2,266 | 2,359 | 2,416 | 2,573 | 2,352 | 2,491 | 2,534 | 2,623 | 2,687 | 3,386 | 3,743 | 3,666\n |\n| Equity | 35.10 | 35.06 | 42.34 | 41.10 | 42.31 | 46.15 | 105.7 | 107.2 | 115.8 | 123.2 | 166.9 | 165.4 | 176.1 | 183.6 | 204.1 | 210.9 | 231.7 | 247.6 | 254.2 | 255.7 | 256.5 | 261.3 | 279.4 | 294.1 | 292.3\n |\n| Capitalization |  |  |  |  |  | 75.03 | 138.7 | 138.4 | 167.2 | 147.0 | 117.7 | 164.3 | 165.9 | 125.4 | 167.3 | 219.7 | 232.5 | 241.9 | 307.3 | 366.3 | 319.8 | 429.9 | 387.5 |  |  |\n| Headcount |  |  |  |  |  | 96.37 | 161.0 | 168.8 | 174.4 | 180.7 | 225.0 | 222.3 | 239.8 | 260.2 | 259.0 | 251.2 | 241.4 | 234.6 | 243.4 | 252.5 | 256.1 | 257.0 | 255.4 | 271.0 | 293.7\n |\n\n\n**Note**: Financial data in billions of US dollars and employee data in thousands.

In the United States, it owns and operates two key legal subsidiaries:[171]\n\n\n\n* Chase Bank\n* JPMorgan Securities, LLC.\n\n\nThe modern JPMorgan Chase is broken up into the following four business segments:[172]\n\n\n\n* Asset and Wealth Management (J.P. Morgan)\n* Consumer and Community Banking (Chase)\n* Corporate and Investment banking (J.P. Morgan)\n* Commercial Banking (Chase)\n\n\n### JPMorgan Europe, Ltd.[edit]\n\n\nMain article: J.P. Morgan in the United Kingdom\n\nThe company, known previously as Chase Manhattan International Limited, was founded on September 18, 1968.[173][174] In August 2008, the bank announced plans to construct a new European headquarters at Canary Wharf, London.[175] These plans were subsequently suspended in December 2010, when the bank announced the purchase of a nearby existing office tower at 25 Bank Street for use as the European headquarters of its investment bank.[176] 25 Bank Street had originally been designated as the European headquarters of Enron and was subsequently used as the headquarters of Lehman Brothers International.[*importance?*] The regional office is in London with offices in Bournemouth, Glasgow, and Edinburgh for asset management, private banking, and investment banking.[177]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition history[edit]\n\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, although this is not a comprehensive list:\n\n\n\n* JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\t+ JPMorgan Chase (merged 2000)\n\t\t- Chase Manhattan Bank (merged 1996)[178]\n\t\t\t* Chemical Bank (merged 1996)\n\t\t\t\t+ Chemical Bank (reorganized 1988)\n\t\t\t\t\t- The Chemical Bank of New York (est. 1823)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Citizens National Bank (est. 1851, acq. 1920)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Corn Exchange Bank (est. 1852, acq. 1954)\n\t\t\t\t\t- New York Trust Company (acq. 1959)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Texas Commerce Bank (est. 1866, acq. 1986)[179]\n\t\t\t\t+ Manufacturers Hanover (merged 1961)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Manufacturers Trust Company (est. 1905)[180]\n\t\t\t\t\t- Hanover Bank (est. 1873)\n\t\t\t* Chase Manhattan Bank (merged 1955)\n\t\t\t\t+ The Bank of the Manhattan Company (est. 1799)\n\t\t\t\t+ Chase National Bank of the City of New York (est. 1877)[181]\n\t\t- J.P.

JPMorgan's giving has been focused on Republicans, with 62 percent of its donations going to GOP recipients in 2014. 78 House Democrats received campaign cash from JPMorgan's PAC in the 2014 cycle at an average of $5,200 and a total of 38 of the Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill took money from JPMorgan's PAC in 2014. JPMorgan Chase's PAC made maximum donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the leadership PACs of Steny Hoyer and Jim Himes in 2014.[187]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that they had committed a five-year $20 million commitment in support of summer youth employment programs (SYEPs) across 24 cities in the United States. This commitment came as part of the organisations wider $30 billion commitment to drive inclusive economic recovery and increase opportunities for underserved communities. The latest commitment will place funds to local governments, employers, and community partners to aid in giving young people access to SYEPs and gain experience to help in building careers.[188]\n\n\n\n## Climate change[edit]\n\n\nJPMorgan has come under criticism for investing in new fossil fuels projects since the Paris climate change agreement. From 2016 to the first half of 2019 it provided $75 billion (£61 billion) to companies expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration.[189] According to Rainforest Action Network its total fossil fuel financing was $64 billion in 2018, $69 billion in 2017 and $62 billion in 2016.[190] From 2015, which is when the Paris Agreement was adopted, until 2021, JP Morgan Chase provided $317 billion in fossil fuel financing; 33% more than any other bank.[191] On October 21, 2021, JP Morgan Chase joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance,[192] which supports \"the global transition of the real economy to net-zero emissions.\"[193]\n\n\nAn internal study, 'Risky business: the climate and macroeconomy', by bank economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray was leaked in early‑2020.[*importance?*] The report, dated 14 January 2020, states that under our current unsustainable trajectory of climate change \"we cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened\". JPMorgan subsequently distanced itself from the content of the study.[194]\n\n\nIn May 2023, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would purchase $200 million in carbon credits representing 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from multiple companies (including Climeworks and Charm Industrial) after announcing the previous month that it would join the Frontier CDR initiative formed by Alphabet Inc., McKinsey & Company, Meta Platforms, Shopify, and Stripe, Inc. under a $925 million advance market commitment to the CDR industry the previous year.[list 1]\n\n\n\n## Offices[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the old Chase Manhattan Bank's headquarters were at One Chase Manhattan Plaza (now 28 Liberty Street) in Lower Manhattan, the current temporary world headquarters for JPMorgan Chase & Co. are located at 383 Madison Avenue. In 2018, JPMorgan announced they would demolish the current headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue, which was Union Carbide's former headquarters, to make way for a newer building at 270 Park Avenue that will be 681 feet (208 m) taller than the previous building. Demolition was completed in the spring of 2021, and the new building will be completed in 2025. The replacement 1,388 feet (423 m) and 70-story headquarters will contain 2,500,000 square feet (230,000 m2), and will be able to fit 15,000 employees, whereas the current building fits 6,000 employees in a space that has a capacity of 3,500. The new headquarters is part of the East Midtown rezoning plan.[201] When construction is completed in 2025, the headquarters will then move back into the new building at 270 Park Avenue. As the new headquarters is replaced, the bulk of North American operations take place in five nearby buildings on or near Park Avenue in New York City: the former Bear Stearns Building at 383 Madison Avenue (just south of 270 Park Avenue), the former Chemical Bank Building at 277 Park Avenue just to the east, 237 Park Avenue, and 390 Madison Avenue.\n\n\nApproximately 11,050 employees are located in Columbus at the McCoy Center, the former Bank One Corporation offices. The building is the largest JPMorgan Chase & Co. facility in the world and the second-largest single-tenant office building in the United States behind The Pentagon.[202] The bank moved some of its operations to the JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston, when it purchased Texas Commerce Bank.[*citation needed*] The Global Corporate Bank's main headquarters are in London, with regional headquarters in Hong Kong, New York and São Paulo.[203]\n\n\nThe Card Services division has its headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, with Card Services offices in Elgin, Illinois; Springfield, Missouri; San Antonio, Texas; Mumbai, India; and Cebu, Philippines. Additional large operation centers are located in Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California, Newark, Delaware; Orlando, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Jacksonville, Florida; Brandon, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Brooklyn, New York; Rochester, New York; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Plano, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Operation centers in Canada are located in Burlington, Ontario; and Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\nAdditional offices and technology operations are located in Manila, Philippines; Cebu, Philippines; Mumbai, India; Bangalore, India; Hyderabad, India; New Delhi, India; Buenos Aires, Argentina; São Paulo; Mexico City, Mexico, and Jerusalem, Israel. In late 2017, JPMorgan Chase opened a new global operations center in Warsaw, Poland.[204] The Asia Pacific headquarters for JPMorgan is located in Hong Kong at Chater House.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOperations centers in the United Kingdom are located in Bournemouth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Liverpool, and Swindon. The London location also serves as the European headquarters.\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Temporary World Headquarters 383 Madison Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Temporary World Headquarters  \n383 Madison Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![JPMorgan Chase World Headquarters (under construction) 270 Park Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase World Headquarters (under construction)  \n270 Park Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![277 Park Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\n277 Park Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![28 Liberty Street, New York City, New York](image)\n\n28 Liberty Street  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![Chase Tower Chicago, Illinois](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nChicago, Illinois\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Building San Francisco, California](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Building  \nSan Francisco, California\n* ![Chase Tower Dallas, Texas](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nDallas, Texas\n* ![Chase Tower Phoenix, Arizona](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nPhoenix, Arizona\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Tower Houston, Texas](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Tower  \nHouston, Texas\n* ![25 Bank Street London, United Kingdom](image)\n\n25 Bank Street  \nLondon, United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO.[205][206] As of 2013 JPMorgan had the largest credit default swap and credit derivatives portfolio by total notional amount of any US bank.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### 2012 CDS trading loss[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss\n\nIn April 2012, hedge fund insiders became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of Bruno Iksil, a trader for JPMorgan Chase & Co., referred to as \"the London whale\" in reference to the huge positions he was taking. Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of J.P. Morgan, who purchased the derivatives offered by J.P. Morgan in such high volume.[209][210] Early reports were denied and minimized by the firm in an attempt to minimize exposure.[211] Major losses, $2 billion, were reported by the firm in May 2012, in relation to these trades and updated to $4.4 billion on July 13, 2012.[212] The disclosure, which resulted in headlines in the media, did not disclose the exact nature of the trading involved, which remained in progress as of June 28, 2012, and continued to produce losses which could total as much as $9 billion under worst-case scenarios.[213][214] In the end, the trading produced actual losses of only $6 billion. The item traded, possibly related to CDX IG 9, an index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations,[215][216] has been described as a \"derivative of a derivative\".[217][218] On the company's emergency conference call, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the strategy was \"flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored\".[219] The episode was investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the FBI.[220]\n\n\n\n\n\nFines levied regarding the 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss[221]\n| Regulator | Nation | Fine\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Office of the Comptroller of the Currency | US | $300m\n |\n| Securities and Exchange Commission | $200m\n |\n| Federal Reserve | $200m\n |\n| Financial Conduct Authority | UK | £138m ($220m US)\n |\n\n\nOn September 18, 2013, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $920 million in fines and penalties to American and UK regulators for violations related to the trading loss and other incidents. The fine was part of a multiagency and multinational settlement with the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. The company also admitted breaking American securities law.[222] The fines amounted to the third biggest banking fine levied by US regulators, and the second-largest by UK authorities.[221] As of September 19, 2013[update], two traders face criminal proceedings.[221] It is also the first time in several years that a major American financial institution has publicly admitted breaking the securities laws.[223]\n\n\nA report by the SEC was critical of the level of oversight from senior management on traders, and the FCA said the incident demonstrated \"flaws permeating all levels of the firm: from portfolio level right up to senior management.\"[221] On the day of the fine, the BBC reported from the New York Stock Exchange that the fines \"barely registered\" with traders there, the news had been an expected development, and the company had prepared for the financial hit.[221]\n\n\n\n## Art collection[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: J. P. Morgan § Collector of art, books, and gemstones\n\nThe collection was begun in 1959 by David Rockefeller,[224] and comprises over 30,000 objects, of which over 6,000 are photographic-based,[225] as of 2012 containing more than one hundred works by Middle Eastern and North African artists.[226] The One Chase Manhattan Plaza building was the original location at the start of collection by the Chase Manhattan Bank, the current collection containing both this and also those works that the First National Bank of Chicago had acquired prior to assimilation into the JPMorgan Chase organization.[227] L. K. Erf has been the director of acquisitions of works since 2004 for the bank,[228] whose art program staff is completed by an additional three full-time members and one registrar.[229] The advisory committee at the time of the Rockefeller initiation included A. H. Barr, and D. Miller, and also J. J. Sweeney, R. Hale, P. Rathbone and G. Bunshaft.[230]\n\n\n\n## Major sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Chase Field (formerly Bank One Ballpark), Phoenix, Arizona – Arizona Diamondbacks, MLB\n* Chase Center, San Francisco, California – Golden State Warriors, NBA\n* Major League Soccer\n* Chase Auditorium (formerly Bank One Auditorium) inside of Chase Tower in Chicago, Illinois (formerly Bank One Tower)\n* The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge, owned and operated by JPMorgan Chase, is the largest corporate road racing series in the world with over 200,000 participants in 12 cities in six countries on five continents.

The acquisition deal of Bank One in 2004, was designed in part to recruit Dimon to JPMorgan Chase.
