For the women's rankings, see WTA rankings.\n\nThe Pepperstone **ATP rankings**[1] are the merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[2] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year). Novak Djokovic is currently the men's singles world No. 1.\n\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic, men's singles No. 1.\n![](image)Carlos Alcaraz, men's singles No. 2.\n![](image)Daniil Medvedev, men's singles No. 3.\n![](image)Jannik Sinner, men's singles No. 4.\n![](image)Andrey Rublev, men's singles No. 5.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe ATP began as the men's trade union in 1972, through the combined efforts of Jack Kramer, Cliff Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.[3] Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point were controlled by national federations and tournament directors.[4]\n\n\nThe ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.[5] While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that \"everyone had a number hanging over them\", fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.[6]\n\n\nThe original ATP ranking criteria, which were then regularly published weekly only from mid-1979 and persisted through the 1980s, were based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.[4][5] Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria were replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.[5] This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.[5] The computer that calculates the rankings is nicknamed \"Blinky\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nA player's ATP ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 20 tournaments (19 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):\n\n\n\n* The four Grand Slam tournaments\n* The eight mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournaments,[a]\n* The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.[8]\n* The best seven results from the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000, all ATP 500 series, ATP 250 series, ATP Challenger Tour, Futures Series and ATP Cup tournaments played in the calendar year[b]\n\n\nFor a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.\n\n\nRanking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year.[2]\n\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted. From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.[9] The World Team Cup was also included before its cancellation in 2012.\n\n\nFor the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. (e.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match would be extracted from his points).[9]\n\n\nA player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 20th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.[10]\n\n\nFor every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.[2]\n\n\nOnce a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 tournament,[c] his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.[2]\n\n\nPlayers with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under \"Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties\" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply. Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.[2]\n\n\nIn a 52-week period, players shall be permitted to replace up to 3 mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 singles main draw results with a better score from an ATP Tour 500 or ATP Tour 250 event, when the replacing score is achieved after the ATP Tour masters 1000 score that is being replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the player must have competed and not received a ranking penalty at the ATP Tour Masters 1000 tournament to replace the score.[11]\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.[12]\n\n\nWith these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 6 ATP 500 events and the Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 can amass a total of 20,000 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,500 points. As of 2022[update], the maximum points achieved by any player since 2009 is 16,950 by Novak Djokovic, on June 6, 2016.[13]\n\n\n\n## ATP race[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2022 ATP Race, see 2022 ATP Finals § Points breakdown.\n\nThe ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially called the \"ATP Champions Race\", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their \"21st Century Tennis\" strategy announced in 1999.[14] All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate points from tournament to tournament based on their performances.[15] The player and team who end the season with the most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top 8 players and teams participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Ranking method[edit]\n\n\nSince the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Points distribution (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n*Ranking points are awarded as follows:*[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tournament category\n | **W** | F | SF | QF | R16 | R32 | R64 | R128 | Q | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 |\n| **ATP Tour** |\n| Grand Slam | 2000 | 1300 | 800 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 | 30 | 16 | 8 |  |\n| ATP Finals | +900(1500 max) | +400(1000 max) | 200 for each round robin match win(600 max) |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (96D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 30 | 10 | 20 |  | 10 |  |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (56D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 |  | 30 |  | 16 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (48D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  | 16 |  | 8 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (32D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 |  |  |  | 25 |  | 13 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (48D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  | 8 |  | 4 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (32D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  |  | 13 |  | 7 |  |\n| **ATP Challenger Tour** |\n| Challenger 175 | 175 | 90 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 125 | 125 | 64 | 35 | 16 | 8 |  |  |  |  |  | 5 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 100\n | 100 | 50 | 25 | 14 | 7 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 75\n | 75 | 44 | 22 | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 50\n | 50 | 25 | 14 | 8 | 4 |  |  |  |  |  | 3 | 1\n |\n| **ITF Men's World Tennis Tour** |\n| Futures M25\n | 25 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Futures M15\n | 15 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n* (ATP Masters 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.\n* (ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* (ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 5 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.[19]\n\n\nIn addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.[20]\n\n\nStarting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for Davis Cup ties,[21] nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.[22]\n\n\n\n## Current rankings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Current tennis rankings\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For the women's rankings, see WTA rankings.\n\nThe Pepperstone **ATP rankings**[1] are the merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[2] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year). Novak Djokovic is currently the men's singles world No. 1.\n\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic, men's singles No. 1.\n![](image)Carlos Alcaraz, men's singles No. 2.\n![](image)Daniil Medvedev, men's singles No. 3.\n![](image)Jannik Sinner, men's singles No. 4.\n![](image)Andrey Rublev, men's singles No. 5.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe ATP began as the men's trade union in 1972, through the combined efforts of Jack Kramer, Cliff Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.[3] Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point were controlled by national federations and tournament directors.[4]\n\n\nThe ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.[5] While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that \"everyone had a number hanging over them\", fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.[6]\n\n\nThe original ATP ranking criteria, which were then regularly published weekly only from mid-1979 and persisted through the 1980s, were based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.[4][5] Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria were replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.[5] This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.[5] The computer that calculates the rankings is nicknamed \"Blinky\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nA player's ATP ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 20 tournaments (19 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):\n\n\n\n* The four Grand Slam tournaments\n* The eight mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournaments,[a]\n* The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.[8]\n* The best seven results from the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000, all ATP 500 series, ATP 250 series, ATP Challenger Tour, Futures Series and ATP Cup tournaments played in the calendar year[b]\n\n\nFor a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.\n\n\nRanking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year.[2]\n\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted. From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.[9] The World Team Cup was also included before its cancellation in 2012.\n\n\nFor the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. (e.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match would be extracted from his points).[9]\n\n\nA player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 20th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.[10]\n\n\nFor every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.[2]\n\n\nOnce a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 tournament,[c] his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.[2]\n\n\nPlayers with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under \"Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties\" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply. Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.[2]\n\n\nIn a 52-week period, players shall be permitted to replace up to 3 mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 singles main draw results with a better score from an ATP Tour 500 or ATP Tour 250 event, when the replacing score is achieved after the ATP Tour masters 1000 score that is being replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the player must have competed and not received a ranking penalty at the ATP Tour Masters 1000 tournament to replace the score.[11]\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.[12]\n\n\nWith these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 6 ATP 500 events and the Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 can amass a total of 20,000 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,500 points. As of 2022[update], the maximum points achieved by any player since 2009 is 16,950 by Novak Djokovic, on June 6, 2016.[13]\n\n\n\n## ATP race[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2022 ATP Race, see 2022 ATP Finals § Points breakdown.\n\nThe ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially called the \"ATP Champions Race\", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their \"21st Century Tennis\" strategy announced in 1999.[14] All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate points from tournament to tournament based on their performances.[15] The player and team who end the season with the most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top 8 players and teams participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Ranking method[edit]\n\n\nSince the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Points distribution (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n*Ranking points are awarded as follows:*[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tournament category\n | **W** | F | SF | QF | R16 | R32 | R64 | R128 | Q | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 |\n| **ATP Tour** |\n| Grand Slam | 2000 | 1300 | 800 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 | 30 | 16 | 8 |  |\n| ATP Finals | +900(1500 max) | +400(1000 max) | 200 for each round robin match win(600 max) |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (96D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 30 | 10 | 20 |  | 10 |  |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (56D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 |  | 30 |  | 16 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (48D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  | 16 |  | 8 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (32D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 |  |  |  | 25 |  | 13 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (48D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  | 8 |  | 4 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (32D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  |  | 13 |  | 7 |  |\n| **ATP Challenger Tour** |\n| Challenger 175 | 175 | 90 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 125 | 125 | 64 | 35 | 16 | 8 |  |  |  |  |  | 5 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 100\n | 100 | 50 | 25 | 14 | 7 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 75\n | 75 | 44 | 22 | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 50\n | 50 | 25 | 14 | 8 | 4 |  |  |  |  |  | 3 | 1\n |\n| **ITF Men's World Tennis Tour** |\n| Futures M25\n | 25 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Futures M15\n | 15 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n* (ATP Masters 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.\n* (ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* (ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 5 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.[19]\n\n\nIn addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.[20]\n\n\nStarting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for Davis Cup ties,[21] nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.[22]\n\n\n\n## Current rankings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Current tennis rankings\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For the women's rankings, see WTA rankings.\n\nThe Pepperstone **ATP rankings**[1] are the merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[2] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year). Novak Djokovic is currently the men's singles world No. 1.\n\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic, men's singles No. 1.\n![](image)Carlos Alcaraz, men's singles No. 2.\n![](image)Daniil Medvedev, men's singles No. 3.\n![](image)Jannik Sinner, men's singles No. 4.\n![](image)Andrey Rublev, men's singles No. 5.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe ATP began as the men's trade union in 1972, through the combined efforts of Jack Kramer, Cliff Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.[3] Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point were controlled by national federations and tournament directors.[4]\n\n\nThe ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.[5] While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that \"everyone had a number hanging over them\", fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.[6]\n\n\nThe original ATP ranking criteria, which were then regularly published weekly only from mid-1979 and persisted through the 1980s, were based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.[4][5] Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria were replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.[5] This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.[5] The computer that calculates the rankings is nicknamed \"Blinky\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nA player's ATP ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 20 tournaments (19 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):\n\n\n\n* The four Grand Slam tournaments\n* The eight mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournaments,[a]\n* The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.[8]\n* The best seven results from the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000, all ATP 500 series, ATP 250 series, ATP Challenger Tour, Futures Series and ATP Cup tournaments played in the calendar year[b]\n\n\nFor a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.\n\n\nRanking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year.[2]\n\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted. From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.[9] The World Team Cup was also included before its cancellation in 2012.\n\n\nFor the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. (e.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match would be extracted from his points).[9]\n\n\nA player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 20th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.[10]\n\n\nFor every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.[2]\n\n\nOnce a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 tournament,[c] his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.[2]\n\n\nPlayers with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under \"Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties\" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply. Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.[2]\n\n\nIn a 52-week period, players shall be permitted to replace up to 3 mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 singles main draw results with a better score from an ATP Tour 500 or ATP Tour 250 event, when the replacing score is achieved after the ATP Tour masters 1000 score that is being replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the player must have competed and not received a ranking penalty at the ATP Tour Masters 1000 tournament to replace the score.[11]\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.[12]\n\n\nWith these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 6 ATP 500 events and the Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 can amass a total of 20,000 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,500 points. As of 2022[update], the maximum points achieved by any player since 2009 is 16,950 by Novak Djokovic, on June 6, 2016.[13]\n\n\n\n## ATP race[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2022 ATP Race, see 2022 ATP Finals § Points breakdown.\n\nThe ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially called the \"ATP Champions Race\", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their \"21st Century Tennis\" strategy announced in 1999.[14] All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate points from tournament to tournament based on their performances.[15] The player and team who end the season with the most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top 8 players and teams participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Ranking method[edit]\n\n\nSince the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Points distribution (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n*Ranking points are awarded as follows:*[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tournament category\n | **W** | F | SF | QF | R16 | R32 | R64 | R128 | Q | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 |\n| **ATP Tour** |\n| Grand Slam | 2000 | 1300 | 800 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 | 30 | 16 | 8 |  |\n| ATP Finals | +900(1500 max) | +400(1000 max) | 200 for each round robin match win(600 max) |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (96D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 30 | 10 | 20 |  | 10 |  |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (56D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 |  | 30 |  | 16 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (48D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  | 16 |  | 8 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (32D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 |  |  |  | 25 |  | 13 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (48D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  | 8 |  | 4 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (32D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  |  | 13 |  | 7 |  |\n| **ATP Challenger Tour** |\n| Challenger 175 | 175 | 90 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 125 | 125 | 64 | 35 | 16 | 8 |  |  |  |  |  | 5 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 100\n | 100 | 50 | 25 | 14 | 7 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 75\n | 75 | 44 | 22 | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 50\n | 50 | 25 | 14 | 8 | 4 |  |  |  |  |  | 3 | 1\n |\n| **ITF Men's World Tennis Tour** |\n| Futures M25\n | 25 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Futures M15\n | 15 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n* (ATP Masters 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.\n* (ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* (ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 5 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.[19]\n\n\nIn addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.[20]\n\n\nStarting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for Davis Cup ties,[21] nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.[22]\n\n\n\n## Current rankings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Current tennis rankings\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For the women's rankings, see WTA rankings.\n\nThe Pepperstone **ATP rankings**[1] are the merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[2] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year). Novak Djokovic is currently the men's singles world No. 1.\n\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic, men's singles No. 1.\n![](image)Carlos Alcaraz, men's singles No. 2.\n![](image)Daniil Medvedev, men's singles No. 3.\n![](image)Jannik Sinner, men's singles No. 4.\n![](image)Andrey Rublev, men's singles No. 5.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe ATP began as the men's trade union in 1972, through the combined efforts of Jack Kramer, Cliff Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.[3] Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point were controlled by national federations and tournament directors.[4]\n\n\nThe ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.[5] While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that \"everyone had a number hanging over them\", fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.[6]\n\n\nThe original ATP ranking criteria, which were then regularly published weekly only from mid-1979 and persisted through the 1980s, were based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.[4][5] Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria were replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.[5] This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.[5] The computer that calculates the rankings is nicknamed \"Blinky\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nA player's ATP ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 20 tournaments (19 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):\n\n\n\n* The four Grand Slam tournaments\n* The eight mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournaments,[a]\n* The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.[8]\n* The best seven results from the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000, all ATP 500 series, ATP 250 series, ATP Challenger Tour, Futures Series and ATP Cup tournaments played in the calendar year[b]\n\n\nFor a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.\n\n\nRanking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year.[2]\n\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted. From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.[9] The World Team Cup was also included before its cancellation in 2012.\n\n\nFor the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. (e.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match would be extracted from his points).[9]\n\n\nA player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 20th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.[10]\n\n\nFor every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.[2]\n\n\nOnce a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 tournament,[c] his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.[2]\n\n\nPlayers with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under \"Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties\" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply. Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.[2]\n\n\nIn a 52-week period, players shall be permitted to replace up to 3 mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 singles main draw results with a better score from an ATP Tour 500 or ATP Tour 250 event, when the replacing score is achieved after the ATP Tour masters 1000 score that is being replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the player must have competed and not received a ranking penalty at the ATP Tour Masters 1000 tournament to replace the score.[11]\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.[12]\n\n\nWith these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 6 ATP 500 events and the Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 can amass a total of 20,000 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,500 points. As of 2022[update], the maximum points achieved by any player since 2009 is 16,950 by Novak Djokovic, on June 6, 2016.[13]\n\n\n\n## ATP race[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2022 ATP Race, see 2022 ATP Finals § Points breakdown.\n\nThe ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially called the \"ATP Champions Race\", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their \"21st Century Tennis\" strategy announced in 1999.[14] All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate points from tournament to tournament based on their performances.[15] The player and team who end the season with the most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top 8 players and teams participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Ranking method[edit]\n\n\nSince the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Points distribution (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n*Ranking points are awarded as follows:*[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tournament category\n | **W** | F | SF | QF | R16 | R32 | R64 | R128 | Q | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 |\n| **ATP Tour** |\n| Grand Slam | 2000 | 1300 | 800 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 | 30 | 16 | 8 |  |\n| ATP Finals | +900(1500 max) | +400(1000 max) | 200 for each round robin match win(600 max) |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (96D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 30 | 10 | 20 |  | 10 |  |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (56D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 |  | 30 |  | 16 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (48D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  | 16 |  | 8 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (32D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 |  |  |  | 25 |  | 13 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (48D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  | 8 |  | 4 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (32D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  |  | 13 |  | 7 |  |\n| **ATP Challenger Tour** |\n| Challenger 175 | 175 | 90 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 125 | 125 | 64 | 35 | 16 | 8 |  |  |  |  |  | 5 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 100\n | 100 | 50 | 25 | 14 | 7 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 75\n | 75 | 44 | 22 | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 50\n | 50 | 25 | 14 | 8 | 4 |  |  |  |  |  | 3 | 1\n |\n| **ITF Men's World Tennis Tour** |\n| Futures M25\n | 25 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Futures M15\n | 15 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n* (ATP Masters 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.\n* (ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* (ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 5 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.[19]\n\n\nIn addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.[20]\n\n\nStarting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for Davis Cup ties,[21] nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.[22]\n\n\n\n## Current rankings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Current tennis rankings\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For the women's rankings, see WTA rankings.\n\nThe Pepperstone **ATP rankings**[1] are the merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[2] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year). Novak Djokovic is currently the men's singles world No. 1.\n\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic, men's singles No. 1.\n![](image)Carlos Alcaraz, men's singles No. 2.\n![](image)Daniil Medvedev, men's singles No. 3.\n![](image)Jannik Sinner, men's singles No. 4.\n![](image)Andrey Rublev, men's singles No. 5.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe ATP began as the men's trade union in 1972, through the combined efforts of Jack Kramer, Cliff Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.[3] Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point were controlled by national federations and tournament directors.[4]\n\n\nThe ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.[5] While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that \"everyone had a number hanging over them\", fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.[6]\n\n\nThe original ATP ranking criteria, which were then regularly published weekly only from mid-1979 and persisted through the 1980s, were based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.[4][5] Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria were replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.[5] This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.[5] The computer that calculates the rankings is nicknamed \"Blinky\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nA player's ATP ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 20 tournaments (19 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):\n\n\n\n* The four Grand Slam tournaments\n* The eight mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournaments,[a]\n* The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.[8]\n* The best seven results from the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000, all ATP 500 series, ATP 250 series, ATP Challenger Tour, Futures Series and ATP Cup tournaments played in the calendar year[b]\n\n\nFor a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.\n\n\nRanking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year.[2]\n\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted. From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.[9] The World Team Cup was also included before its cancellation in 2012.\n\n\nFor the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. (e.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match would be extracted from his points).[9]\n\n\nA player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 20th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.[10]\n\n\nFor every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.[2]\n\n\nOnce a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 tournament,[c] his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.[2]\n\n\nPlayers with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under \"Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties\" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply. Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.[2]\n\n\nIn a 52-week period, players shall be permitted to replace up to 3 mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 singles main draw results with a better score from an ATP Tour 500 or ATP Tour 250 event, when the replacing score is achieved after the ATP Tour masters 1000 score that is being replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the player must have competed and not received a ranking penalty at the ATP Tour Masters 1000 tournament to replace the score.[11]\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.[12]\n\n\nWith these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 6 ATP 500 events and the Monte-Carlo Masters 1000 can amass a total of 20,000 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,500 points. As of 2022[update], the maximum points achieved by any player since 2009 is 16,950 by Novak Djokovic, on June 6, 2016.[13]\n\n\n\n## ATP race[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2022 ATP Race, see 2022 ATP Finals § Points breakdown.\n\nThe ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially called the \"ATP Champions Race\", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their \"21st Century Tennis\" strategy announced in 1999.[14] All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate points from tournament to tournament based on their performances.[15] The player and team who end the season with the most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top 8 players and teams participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Ranking method[edit]\n\n\nSince the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Points distribution (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n*Ranking points are awarded as follows:*[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tournament category\n | **W** | F | SF | QF | R16 | R32 | R64 | R128 | Q | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 |\n| **ATP Tour** |\n| Grand Slam | 2000 | 1300 | 800 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 | 30 | 16 | 8 |  |\n| ATP Finals | +900(1500 max) | +400(1000 max) | 200 for each round robin match win(600 max) |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (96D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 30 | 10 | 20 |  | 10 |  |\n| ATP Masters 1000 (56D)\n | 1000 | 650 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 10 |  | 30 |  | 16 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (48D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  | 16 |  | 8 |  |\n| ATP 500 series (32D)\n | 500 | 330 | 200 | 100 | 50 |  |  |  | 25 |  | 13 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (48D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  | 8 |  | 4 |  |\n| ATP 250 series (32D)\n | 250 | 165 | 100 | 50 | 25 |  |  |  | 13 |  | 7 |  |\n| **ATP Challenger Tour** |\n| Challenger 175 | 175 | 90 | 50 | 25 | 13 |  |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 125 | 125 | 64 | 35 | 16 | 8 |  |  |  |  |  | 5 | 3\n |\n| Challenger 100\n | 100 | 50 | 25 | 14 | 7 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 75\n | 75 | 44 | 22 | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 2\n |\n| Challenger 50\n | 50 | 25 | 14 | 8 | 4 |  |  |  |  |  | 3 | 1\n |\n| **ITF Men's World Tennis Tour** |\n| Futures M25\n | 25 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Futures M15\n | 15 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n* (ATP Masters 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.\n* (ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* (ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 5 points only if the main draw is larger than 32.\n* Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.[19]\n\n\nIn addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.[20]\n\n\nStarting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for Davis Cup ties,[21] nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.[22]\n\n\n\n## Current rankings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Current tennis rankings\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 by the ATP, achieved on 2 October 2023, making him the highest ranked Italian male player in history (tied with Adriano Panatta). He also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved on 27 September 2021. Sinner has won ten ATP Tour titles in singles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open, and one in doubles.\n\n\nSinner grew up in northern Italy in the region of South Tyrol. He was active in skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. He won the ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2019 after breaking through into the top 100, reaching his first ATP semifinal, and winning the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan.\n\n\nSinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal (becoming the youngest quarterfinalist in men's singles since Novak Djokovic in 2006), and a maiden ATP title at the 2020 Sofia Open. He had a strong start to 2021, highlighted by his second ATP title in a row and a Masters 1000 runner-up at the Miami Open. On 1 November 2021, he became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the ATP top 10. He became the first teenage ATP 500 champion since the category was renamed in 2009 by winning the 2021 Citi Open. Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nJannik Sinner was born 16 August 2001 to Hanspeter and Siglinde Sinner in Innichen in the region of South Tyrol in northern Italy into a Roman Catholic family. He grew up in the town of Sexten, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge.[2] He has a brother named Marc.[3] Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.[4][5][6]\n\n\nWhile training in skiing, Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport.[7] When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach.[8] Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.[9][10]\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nSinner began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour which is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in 2016. Despite having limited success as a junior, he moved mainly to the professional tour following the end of 2017. He never played the main draw of any high-level Grade 1 events in singles, and the only higher-level Grade A tournament he entered was the Trofeo Bonfiglio. He followed up an opening round loss at Italy's Grade A tournament in 2017 with a quarterfinal in 2018. That was the only junior event he played in 2018. He never played any of the junior Grand Slam tournaments. Because he entered so few high-level tournaments, Sinner's career-high junior ranking was a relatively low No. 133.[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2018: ITF Futures and Challenger Tour[edit]\n\n\nSinner wasn't too focused on the junior circuit,[*clarification needed*] and he began playing on the ITF Men's Circuit in early 2018. With his low ranking, he could initially be directly accepted into only ITF Futures events. Nonetheless, he began receiving wild cards for ATP Challenger Tour events, the second-tier tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in the second half of the year.[13] His only ITF title of the year was in doubles,[14] and he finished the season ranked No. 551.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2019: NextGen Finals title and top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2019 NextGen ATP Finals in Milan\nSinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level. He became the first person born in 2001 to reach a Challenger final, and the youngest Italian to win a Challenger title in history. With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324.[16][17] After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz.[18] The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.[19]\n\n\nDuring the second half of the season, Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour.[20] His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July.[15] The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles.[21] After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open.[22] He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.[20]\n\n\nSinner had a strong finish to the season. As a wild card at the European Open, he became the youngest player in five years to reach an ATP semifinal.[23] Along the way, he knocked off top seed and world No. 13 Gaël Monfils for his first career top 50 victory.[24] This performance helped him break into the top 100 for the first time one week later.[15] At the end of the season, Sinner qualified for the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals as the Italian wild card and the lowest seed.[25] He won in his round robin group with victories over Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer, losing only to Ugo Humbert. After defeating Miomir Kecmanović in the semifinals, Sinner upset top seed and world No. 18 Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win the title.[26] He played one last event in Italy the following week, winning a third Challenger title in Ortisei. Sinner finished the year at world No. 78, becoming the youngest player in the year-end top 80 since Rafael Nadal in 2003.[18] He was also named ATP Newcomer of the Year.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2020: First ATP title and top 40[edit]\n\n\nEarly in the year, Sinner made the second round of the 2020 Australian Open, recording his first Grand Slam main draw match win over home wild card Max Purcell before losing to Márton Fucsovics. As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.[28]\n\n\nFollowing the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[29] He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.[30][31]\n\n\nAfter a semifinal at the Cologne Championship where he lost to Zverev,[32] Sinner closed out the season by winning the Sofia Open for his first ATP title. During the event, he defeated Next Gen rival Alex de Minaur and then Vasek Pospisil in the final.[33] He became the youngest Italian tour-level champion in the Open Era and the youngest player overall to win an ATP title since Kei Nishikori in 2008.[34][35]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked world No. 37.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Four titles, Masters final and top 10 debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2021 French Open\nSinner carried over his success from late 2020 into the start of the 2021 season. He won his second career ATP title at the Great Ocean Road Open,[36] and notably defeated No. 20 Karen Khachanov in the semifinals after saving a match point.[37] He became the youngest to win back-to-back ATP titles since Rafael Nadal in 2005.[36] His ten-match winning streak came to an end in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-set match to world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov.[38]\n\n\nSinner's next big result was at the Miami Open, where he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final. During the tournament, he defeated Khachanov again and later world No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal.[39][40] He finished runner-up to Hubert Hurkacz.[41]\n\n\nThen at the French Open, his campaign was stopped short for the second year running by Rafael Nadal who this time defeated Sinner in straight sets in the fourth round.[42] In his main draw debut at Wimbledon, he lost in the first round to Márton Fucsovics.\n\n\nPartnering Reilly Opelka he won his first doubles title at the 2021 Atlanta Open, defeating Steve Johnson and Jordan Thompson.[43] At the same tournament in singles he fell in the second round to Christopher O'Connell.[44]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Citi Open in Washington, D.C., Sinner went into the tournament as the fifth seed and made it to the finals and beat several young players along the way such as Emil Ruusuvuori, Sebastian Korda, and Jenson Brooksby.[45] He beat Mackenzie McDonald in the final to win his third title and first ATP 500 title. Sinner was the first Italian finalist and champion in Washington's tournament history as well as the youngest ATP 500 and first teen champion since the category was created in 2009.[46] As a result, he entered the top 15 in the ATP rankings on 9 August 2021.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the third round to reach the second week of a Major for the second time in the season. Sinner's tournament ended when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the 4th round in straight sets.\n\n\nSinner successfully defended his title at the Sofia Open as the top seed, defeating again second seed Gaël Monfils in the final.[47]\nSinner made his sixth career final at the 2021 European Open without dropping a set en route. He defeated Lorenzo Musetti, Arthur Rinderknech and Lloyd Harris to reach the final.[48] He bested Diego Schwartzman in the final to take his fifth career title. He became the youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Novak Djokovic.[49]\n\n\nOn 1 November, Sinner became the first male player born in the 2000s to break into the top-10 after a semifinal appearance at the Vienna Open.\nAt the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.[50]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev.[51] He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011.[52][53] Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets. As a result, he re-entered the top-10 in the rankings and finished the year at world No. 10 on 22 November 2021.\n\n\nIn the Davis Cup Finals, Sinner defeated John Isner becoming only the second player (after Thiemo de Bakker) ever to bagel Isner.[54]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Three Major quarterfinals, Davis Cup success[edit]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Sinner reached the quarterfinals of a major for the second time in his career, becoming the fifth Italian man to reach that stage in Melbourne.[55] He then lost to fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the Miami Open, he saved three match points in the opening round against Emil Ruusuvuori and five match points against Pablo Carreño Busta to advance to the round of 16.[56] He then defeated Nick Kyrgios but retired against Francisco Cerúndolo in the quarterfinals. In the Monte Carlo Masters, he again reached the quarterfinals after defeating fifth seed Andrey Rublev, before losing to second seed Alexander Zverev in a three-set and over three hour-long match.[57][58] He again saved three match points in the opener at the Madrid Open against Tommy Paul to move to the second round.[59] Next, he defeated Alex de Minaur for his 100th career win;[60] he hit this milestone after 147 matches (100–47) on Tour, which was a faster rate than everyone in the Top 10 besides Rafael Nadal (100–37) and Novak Djokovic (100–43).[61] He was defeated in the third round by Félix Auger-Aliassime.[62]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he retired in the fourth round against Andrey Rublev after sustaining a knee injury.[63]\n\n\nAt the Eastbourne International, Sinner suffered his first opening round loss of the year after losing to Tommy Paul in three sets.[64] At the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, he recorded his first win at this Major over Stan Wawrinka.[65] He then beat Mikael Ymer, John Isner, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his third career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He lost to top seed and eventual champion Novak Djokovic in five sets in the quarterfinals, after being two sets to love up.[66]\n\n\nAt the Croatia Open, Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his first clay court title.[67] In Montreal, he lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the third round.[68] Sinner's loss guaranteed a maiden Masters 1000 finalist from his half of the draw. At the Cincinnati Masters, he lost in the third round to Félix Auger-Aliassime after being up a set, a break, and 2 match points.[69]\n\n\nSeeded 11th at the US Open, he reached the fourth round after defeating Brandon Nakashima in four sets.[70] Next, he defeated Ilya Ivashka in a five set match lasting close to four hours to reach the quarterfinals for the first time at this Major.[71] He became the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments since Novak Djokovic in 2007–08.[72] He lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes; the match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50 am EST) and second longest match in US Open history. Sinner held a match point while serving up 5–4 in the 4th set, but ended up losing the set 5–7.[73][74]\n\n\nIn September, during the Davis Cup Finals after Matteo Berrettini won his singles match against Argentina, Sinner won the second match (best of three matches) and thus secured a place for Italy's Davis Cup team at the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals.[75] Following close to a month break due to an injury sustained in the semifinal at the 2022 Sofia Open[76] he returned to the 2022 Erste Bank Open in Vienna and reached also the quarterfinals losing to top seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.[77] In his next tournament, the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters, he lost in the first round to qualifier Marc-Andrea Huesler.[78]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked 15th in the world, one space ahead of countryman Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Major semifinal, first Masters & world No. 1 wins, World No. 4, ATP Finals debut[edit]\n\n\nSinner's season started at the 2023 Adelaide international 1, where he reached the quarter-final, defeating Kyle Edmund and Thanasi Kokkinakis, before coming up short to eventual finalist Sebastian Korda, being straight-setted 7–5 6–1.\nHis season continued at the 2023 Australian Open, where he made the 4th round, beating Kyle Edmund for the second time, Tomás Martín Etcheverry and Márton Fucsovics before losing to eventual finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in 5 sets.\n\n\nSinner won the 2023 Open Sud de France in Montpellier, his seventh title, becoming the first player to win a tour-level title in the season without having dropped a single set and the first since countryman Lorenzo Musetti won the title in Naples in October 2022.[79]\nAt the 2023 ABN AMRO Open he defeated top seed and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas taking his revenge for the 2023 Australian Open fourth round five setter loss, for his biggest win ever.[80] Next in the quarterfinals, he defeated Stan Wawrinka.[81] In the semifinals, he defeated home favorite Tallon Griekspoor to reach the final.[82] He lost to sixth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\n\nIn March, he played in Indian Wells where he made the semifinals.[83] He defeated Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, and Stan Wawrinka all in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals where he faced defending champion Taylor Fritz and won in a three-set match. In the following round in the semifinals, he lost in straight sets to rival top seed Carlos Alcaraz who returned to world No. 1 following the tournament. \nIn Miami, he reached the quarterfinals of this tournament for a third straight year defeating 21st seed Grigor Dimitrov and sixth seed Andrey Rublev.[84] As a result, he returned to the top 10 in the rankings at world No. 9. He defeated Emil Ruusuvuori to reach back-to-back semifinals.[85] This time he defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to reach his second Miami and career Masters final in three years,[86] putting an end to Alcaraz's hopes for a Sunshine Double and preventing him from returning to the No. 1 spot.[87] He lost to fourth seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets in the final, extending his losing streak versus the Russian to 0–6.[88]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he reached a third consecutive Masters semifinal defeating compatriot and 16th seed Lorenzo Musetti.[89]\nAt the French Open, Sinner, as the No. 8 seed in the draw, was upset as the heavy favourite in the second round by Daniel Altmaier in a five-set match. Sinner served for the match in the fourth set and had match point, but was denied on a net cord shot by Altmaier, who proceeded to break back and eventually win the set and the match.[*citation needed*] The five sets match included three tiebreaks, of which Sinner only won one, in the first set. The match lasted five hours and 26 minutes, the longest match since Lorenzo Giustino against Corentin Moutet six hours and 5 minutes win in 2020, the fifth longest overall of the tournament[90] and the second longest of the season after Kokkinakis against Murray at the Australian Open.[91][92]\n\n\nHe reached back to back quarterfinals at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Diego Schwartzman, Quentin Halys and Daniel Elahi Galan.[93] He reached his first Major semifinal defeating Roman Safiullin, before losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[94]\n\n\nIn August, he won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto defeating Alex de Minaur in straight sets for his eighth ATP title.[95] En route to the final, he defeated compatriot Matteo Berrettini, Andy Murray by walkover, Gaël Monfils, and Tommy Paul.\n\n\nAt the 2023 China Open, he defeated top seed and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, his fourth tour-level win against the Spaniard, to reach his fifth final of the season, defeating second seed and world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev for the first time at the seventh time of asking.[96] As a result, he reached World No. 4 to become the second Italian in the history of the ATP rankings to reach the Top 5, equaling Adriano Panatta.[97] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he lost in the round of 16 to 19th seed Ben Shelton.[98]\n\n\nHe recorded his 55th win over Andrey Rublev to reach his fourth ATP 500 career final in Vienna and became the first Italian man with the most wins for a season in the Open Era surpassing Corrado Barazzutti's 54 mark in 1978.[99] He won the final defeating again top seed Daniil Medvedev to win his tenth ATP title and third at the ATP 500 level, defeating him in two consecutive finals and improving his head-to-head record against the Russian to 2–6. He also recorded his 40 tour-level hard court win in a season for the first time.[100]\n\n\nOn his debut at the 2023 ATP Finals he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the round robin stage, his fifth top-5 win in a row.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nSinner is an aggressive baseliner and is one of the hardest hitters on the ATP tour. Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 kilometres per hour (69.1 mph).[103] His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 100 mph on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.\n\n\nHe also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 kilometres per hour (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%, and it can frequently dip below 55%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint(legs together) and platform(legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.\n\n\nSinner has been compared to Roger Federer for his calm on-court demeanour and all-court movement.[4][7][11] Federer himself has praised Sinner for the balance in his game, remarking, \"What I like about him is that he almost has the same speed of shooting from the forehand and backhand\".[6] Former world No. 1 junior and tennis coach Claudio Pistolesi has praised Sinner's good lateral movement, which he attributes in part to Sinner's background in skiing.[104] In this regard, Sinner has been compared to Novak Djokovic, who also credits a background in skiing for improving his tennis skills.[105]\n\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\nWhen Sinner began to prioritise tennis at age thirteen, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who had also been a part-time coach of Novak Djokovic and Milos Raonic.[11] At the time, he also began working with Andrea Volpini and Massimo Sartori, the latter of whom was a longtime coach of Andreas Seppi.[106] He continued to work with Piatti as his primary coach, and Volpini as his second coach. His team also consisted of physiotherapist Claudio Zimaglia and fitness coach Dalibor Sirola.[10] In February 2022, he decided to stop his long collaboration with Piatti and his team and began to train with Simone Vagnozzi, ex-coach of Marco Cecchinato.[107] In July 2022, coach Darren Cahill officially joined Sinner's team.[108]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco.[3] He is a fan of A.C. Milan football club.[9] One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from Alto Adige. Nonetheless, he has already surpassed Seppi in terms of achievements, with his main idols being Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.[17]\n\n\nSinner speaks three languages: German (mother tongue), Italian and English.[109]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nSinner endorses Nike,[110] Head,[111] Rolex,[112] Gucci,[113] Lavazza,[114] Alfa Romeo,[115] FASTWEB,[116] Technogym,[117] and Parmigiano Reggiano.[118]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jannik Sinner career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 1R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 4\n | 8–4\n | 67%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | QF | 4R | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 4\n | 11–4\n | 73%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q1 | NH\n | 1R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 9–3\n | 75%\n |\n| US Open | 1R | 1R | 4R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 5\n | 10–5\n | 67%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 5–3\n | 6–4\n | 15–4\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 16\n | 38–16\n | 70%\n |\n\n\nSource: ATP profile[3]\n\n\n\n### Year-end championships finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Masters 1000 finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | Miami Open | Hard\n | ![Poland](image) Hubert Hurkacz | 6–7(4–7), 4–6\n |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | Miami Open\n | Hard\n | ![](image) Daniil Medvedev | 5–7, 3–6\n |\n| Win\n | 2023 | Canadian Open | Hard\n | ![Australia](image) Alex de Minaur | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Jannik Sinner career statistics\n* Italian players best ranking\n* Tennis in Italy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Italian pronunciation: [ˈjannik ˈsinner]; German pronunciation: [ˈjanɪk ˈzɪnɐ]\n\n1. **^** \"Jannik Sinner | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia. In December 2010, he won his first junior title as a qualifier at just his third tournament.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n2012–2013 would see Medvedev surge on the junior circuit as he won six titles between October 2012 and July 2013 which included four consecutive titles. He made his junior Grand Slam debut at 2013 Junior Wimbledon where he won his first round match against Hong Seong-chan but lost in the second round to 2nd seed Nikola Milojević. At the 2013 Junior US Open, he went into the tournament seeded 10th and made the third round where he lost to Johan Tatlot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev reached his career-high junior ranking of world No. 13 at the beginning of 2014 and went into the 2014 Junior Australian Open seeded 8th. He ended his junior career after a first round loss at 2014 Junior Wimbledon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev ended his junior career with an overall win–loss record of 109–43 and wins over several future stars including Alexander Zverev and Reilly Opelka.[26]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nWimbledon: 2R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: 3R (2013)\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016 Early pro career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev made his ATP main draw debut at the 2015 Kremlin Cup, partnering Aslan Karatsev in the doubles event. The two defeated Aliaksandr Bury and Denis Istomin in the first round but were defeated by Radu Albot and František Čermák in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2015 Nice Open\nAs a qualifier, Medvedev made his ATP singles main draw debut at the 2016 Nice Open, losing to Guido Pella in three sets. Three weeks later he earned his first singles ATP World Tour win at the 2016 Ricoh Open, defeating Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high. In February, he advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Open Sud de France and the Open 13, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille respectively.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June, he made it to the quarterfinals of the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, defeating the 6th seed, Robin Haase, and Thanasi Kokkinakis before losing to Ivo Karlović in straight sets. At the Aegon Championships, he advanced to his first ATP 500 quarterfinal by beating Nicolas Mahut and Kokkinakis in the first two rounds, before losing to the No. 6 seed, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarterfinals. One week later, he on grass advanced to the semifinal of Eastbourne International, losing to Novak Djokovic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev registered his maiden Grand Slam match win at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, defeating fifth seed and world No. 3, Stan Wawrinka, in the first round in four sets.[29] He lost in the next round to Ruben Bemelmans.[30] Medvedev was handed three fines totaling $14,500 (£11,200) for his conduct during the match with Bemelmans: $7,000 for insulting the umpire on two occasions and $7,500 for throwing coins under the umpire's chair.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev serving at the 2017 Queen's Club Championships\n### 2018 First ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the 2018 season by qualifying for the Sydney International. He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final. This triumph brought him to a new career high ranking of No. 22 and made him the No. 1 player in Russia. The victory also marked the third consecutive final that Medvedev had beaten the home favorite in to win the title. Medvedev reached the Kremlin Cup semifinal, losing to his countryman and eventual champion Karen Khachanov. One week later, he made the semifinals at the ATP 500 Swiss Indoors event, which he lost to Roger Federer. After the tournament, he achieved a new career high ranking of world No. 16.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev finished 2018 with the most hard court match wins of any player on the ATP Tour (38 wins). He also had the most titles on hard court tournaments (3 titles), tying with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Karen Khachanov.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Two Masters titles, US Open final[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the season strongly by reaching the final of the Brisbane International, defeating Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route, but then lost to Kei Nishikori.[34] At the Australian Open, he was seeded 15th, the first time he was seeded at a major. He reached the round of 16 for the first time in his career, where he was defeated by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.[35] In February, Medvedev won his fourth ATP title at the Sofia Open, beating Márton Fucsovics in the final.[36] The following week, Medvedev lost in the semifinals of Rotterdam to Gaël Monfils. Medvedev entered the Monte Carlo Masters having only won two of his 13 career matches on clay courts. Despite this, he reached his first ever Masters 1000 quarterfinal at the event after defeating world No. 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[37] In the quarterfinals, Medvedev earned his first triumph over a world number 1 ranked player, when he defeated Djokovic in three sets.[38] His run ended in the semifinals against Dušan Lajović.[39] At the Barcelona Open, Medvedev earned his third successive top 10 victory (this time over Kei Nishikori) to reach his first clay-court final.[40] There, he was defeated by world No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[41] Following his victory over Nishikori, Medvedev experienced a five-match losing streak, including an opening-round defeat at the French Open. He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov. In the final, he was defeated by defending champion Rafael Nadal. Medvedev would reach a second consecutive Masters final at Cincinnati after beating defending champion Djokovic for the second time, where he defeated David Goffin in straight sets for his first Masters title.[43]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the US Open as the world No. 5.[44] In his second round match, he fought off cramping to defeat Hugo Dellien in four sets.[45] He then defeated Feliciano López in a contentious match for which he was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $4,000 for flipping off the crowd.[46][47] Medvedev next recovered from a set and a break deficit to beat Dominik Köpfer and reach his first Major quarterfinal.[48] He then beat former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals to reach his first Grand Slam final.[49][50] There, Medvedev was defeated by Rafael Nadal in five sets.[51]\n\n\nMedvedev followed up his success in North America with his maiden title on Russian soil at the St. Petersburg Open, to become the first Russian to win the tournament in 15 years.[52][53] Medvedev then won a second consecutive title at the Shanghai Masters, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.[54] By reaching the final, Medvedev became the 7th man since 2000 to reach at least nine finals in a season.[55][56][57] He ended the season losing his last four matches, including all three round robin matches in his ATP Finals debut.\n\n\n\n### 2020 ATP Finals champion, third Masters title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2020 Australian Open\nMedvedev opened his season at the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup as Russia's top ranked singles player. He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles. This included 3 top ten victories (over Diego Schwartzman, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini) extending his win streak over top 10 opponents to ten wins.[65] Medvedev then reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open after straight sets victories over Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, extending his win streak against top 10 opponents to twelve wins, and his overall win streak to twenty wins. In the final, he was defeated by the defending champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[66]\n\n\nMedvedev won his first title of the season at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final.[67] With the win, Medvedev ascended to world number 2 in the ATP rankings, becoming the first man outside of the Big Four to occupy a position in the top 2 since Lleyton Hewitt in July 2005.[68] On 13 April, Medvedev tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters.[69] At the French Open, Medvedev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the grass-court season, Medvedev took a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Championships, where he won his first career grass-court title. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev was upset in the fourth round by Grigor Dimitrov.[81] At the Paris Masters, Medvedev reached the final for the second consecutive year, but lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[82] In his third ATP Finals, Medvedev qualified for the semifinals after winning all of his group matches. He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev represented Russia in the third edition of the ATP Cup. Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. In the final, he was defeated in five epic sets by Rafael Nadal despite taking a two-set lead. At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios. At the Cincinnati Masters, Medvedev was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semifinals. Medvedev was yet again defeated by Kyrgios at the US Open, resulting in Medvedev losing his number one ranking.[105]\n\n\nMedvedev began the fall indoor-hardcourt season by competing at the Moselle Open, where he lost his opening match to Stan Wawrinka in three sets. Medvedev next competed at the Astana Open where he reached the semifinals. In his semifinal match, against Novak Djokovic, Medvedev was forced to retire with the match level at one-set-all with a leg injury.[106][107] Medvedev returned to play at the Vienna Open where he defeated Denis Shapovalov in the final to win his second title of the year, and second ATP 500 title of his career.[108] Medvedev finished the year on a 4 match losing skid, losing in the opening round in Paris Masters, and losing all three of his round robin matches in the ATP Finals in third-set tiebreakers. This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round. As a result, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 to World No. 12.\n\n\nIn February, Medvedev entered the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam seeded 6th, where he made it to the finals whilst dropping only one set. In the final, he defeated Italian No. 1 Jannik Sinner in three sets,[110] thus returning back to the Top 10. The following week, Medvedev entered the Qatar ExxonMobil Open seeded third and won the tournament, defeating Andy Murray in straight sets in the final.\n\n\nIn March, Medvedev defeated No. 2 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets in an all-Russian final to win in Dubai his third title in three weeks,[111] and his 18th title overall thus winning titles in 18 different cities and becoming the first man in the Open Era to accomplish the feat.[112] In this tournament, he did not drop a set including his win against No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic, snapping his 20-match winning streak.[113] As a result he moved back to world No. 6 on 6 March 2023.\n\n\nAt the next Masters 1000 Indian Wells Masters he reached back-to-back quarterfinals defeating 12th seed Alexander Zverev. His victories against 23rd seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and 14h seed Frances Tiafoe propelled him into the final.[114] In the final, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets but reentered the Top 5.[115] In Miami he reached back-to-back finals defeating 14th seed Karen Khachanov and won his 19th title in a 19th different city defeating tenth seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets. He moved to world No. 4 in the rankings on 3 April 2023.[116]\n\n\nMedvedev began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he reached his sixth consecutive quarterfinal with wins over Lorenzo Sonego and 13th seed Alexander Zverev but he lost to sixth seed Holger Rune in the quarterfinals, ending his streak of five consecutive finals.\nAt the next Masters in Madrid he recorded his 300th win over first-time qualifier and compatriot Alexander Shevchenko in the third round.[117] He lost to qualifier, another compatriot Aslan Karatsev in the fourth round. In Rome he reached the semifinals at a Masters 1000 clay-court event for just the second time (after Monte-Carlo 2019) defeating qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.[118] Next he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach only his second final on clay. He won his first clay title defeating Holger Rune, having won 20 titles in 20 different cities. As a result he returned to world No. 2 in the singles rankings on 22 May 2023.[119] Medvedev entered the French Open as the second seed but lost in his first round match against Thiago Seyboth Wild.\n\n\nAt the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, he was seeded 3rd and reached the semifinals for the first time at this Major. Following wins over wildcard Arthur Fery, Adrian Mannarino, Márton Fucsovics, Jiří Lehečka, and Christopher Eubanks in a tight five set match, he set up a semifinal clash with Carlos Alcaraz but lost in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the US Summer Hard Court Swing, Medvedev made the quarterfinals at the Rogers Cup and reached the fourth round at the Cincinnati Masters, losing to Alex De Minaur and Alexander Zverev respectively.[120] Next, at the 2023 US Open, he reached the final following wins over Attila Balazs, Christopher O'Connell, Sebastian Baez, Alex De Minaur, fellow countryman Andrey Rublev, and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals to set up a rematch of the 2021 final with Novak Djokovic. Djokovic won in straight sets on Sunday, September 10. Due to his US Open run, he was the third player to qualify for the 2023 ATP Finals on September 5.[121]\n\n\nAt the Asian Swing, Medvedev reached the final of the China Open where he lost Jannik Sinner straight sets. [122] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he recorded his 60th win of the season to reach the third round over Cristian Garin, after Carlos Alcaraz did the same.[123]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nDaniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches. He also has been employed as an ambassador by BMW, Tinkoff Bank, and HyperX for gaming accessories, mostly for the Russian-speaking world. He was previously endorsed by Lotto for apparel and shoes until 2019.[134][135] Since November 2021, he has been signed as a promoter of the Guojiao 1573 brand.[136]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daniil Medvedev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 1R | 2R | 4R | 4R | F | F | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 21–7\n | 75%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | 1R | 1R | 1R | 1R | QF | 4R | 1R |  | 0 / 7\n | 7–7\n | 50%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q3 | 2R | 3R | 3R | NH\n | 4R | A[a] | SF |  | 0 / 5\n | 13–5\n | 72%\n |\n| US Open | Q1 | 1R | 3R | F | SF | **W** | 4R | F |  | 1 / 7\n | 29–6\n | 83%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–4\n | 5–4\n | 11–4\n | 8–3\n | 20–3\n | 12–3\n | 13–4\n |  | 1 / 26\n | 70–25\n | 74%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Finals: 5 (1 title, 4 runners-ups)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2019 | US Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 5–7, 3–6, 7–5, 6–4, 4–6\n |\n| Loss | 2021 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 5–7, 2–6, 2–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| Loss | 2022 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 6–2, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 4–6, 5–7 |\n| Loss | 2023 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 6–7(5–7), 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2020 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 4–6, 7–6(7–2), 6–4\n |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 4–6, 4–6\n |\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n* These records were attained in the Open Era.\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | 4 consecutive finals of the North American swing/US Open Series | Ivan LendlAndre Agassi[42] |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 in one tournament | Boris BeckerNovak DjokovicDavid Nalbandian |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 to win the ATP Finals | **Stands alone**[138] |\n| 2021\n | Winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season | Andrey RublevFélix Auger-Aliassime |\n| 2021\n | Undefeated winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 2021\n | Tallest Grand Slam champion (6'6\" – 2021 US Open) | Juan Martín del PotroMarin Čilić[139] |\n| 2022\n | Tallest World number 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 2023\n | Winner of his first 20 tour-level titles in 20 different cities | **Stands alone**[140] |\n| 2023\n | Winner of both the Miami Open and Italian Open in the same season\n | Andre AgassiNovak Djokovic |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Medvedev's parents, Sergey and Olga in 2019, receive the Russian Cup[141] |\n\n\nNational\n* The Russian Cup in the nominations:\n\t+ Male Tennis Player of the Year: 2019, 2021;\n\t+ Team of the Year: 2019, 2021.[141]\n* ![](image) Sports title \"Merited Master of Sports of Russia\" (2019)[142]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Russian athletes were banned from competing following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[137][94]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev\". *ATP World Tour*.

Alcaraz has won twelve ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and four Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\nAs a junior, Alcaraz was ranked as high as world No. 22 and won two titles on the ITF Junior Circuit. After turning professional in 2018, he won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour and broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021. Two months later, Alcaraz won his first ATP title at the Croatia Open, an ATP 250 tournament. He later entered the top 50 after reaching the quarterfinals at the following US Open and won the year end Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan. After winning his first ATP 500 title at the Rio Open in February 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open and his second ATP 500 title at the Barcelona Open in April, propelling him into the top 10. In September 2022, Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the US Open final to win his first major singles title. In May 2023, he was awarded the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. In July 2023, Alcaraz won Wimbledon, defeating seven-time and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final to claim his second major singles title. \n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz Garfia was born on 5 May 2003, in El Palmar, Murcia, Spain, to parents Carlos Alcaraz González and Virginia Garfia Escandón. He has three siblings.\n\n\nAlcaraz started playing tennis at the age of four at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia (Royal Society Murciashire Club), where his father was the tennis academy director. Alcaraz' father was a former professional player, but stopped playing when he couldn't afford to any longer. In 2018, he moved to Villena to begin training at Juan Carlos Ferrero's Equelite JC Ferrero Sport Academy.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: ATP debut[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, at the age of 16, Alcaraz made his ATP main-draw debut at the Rio Open after receiving a wildcard for the singles main draw. There, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas.[10] Alcaraz was defeated in the second round by Federico Coria.\n\n\n\n### 2021: First title, Next-Gen Finals champion, top 35[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2021 French Open\nAt age 17, Alcaraz made it to the main draw of the Australian Open, making him the youngest participant in the men's singles.[11] He won his Grand Slam tournament debut defeating fellow qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets before losing in the second round to Mikael Ymer.[12]\n\n\nAlcaraz became the youngest match winner in the Madrid Open's history, defeating Adrian Mannarino as a wildcard and breaking then-18-year-old Rafael Nadal's record from 2004. In the second round, he lost to five-time champion Nadal on Alcaraz's 18th birthday.[13][14][15]\nBy winning the biggest title of his career until then at the 2021 Open de Oeiras III Challenger tournament, he entered the top 100 as the youngest player at the age of 18 on 24 May 2021.[16][17]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Alcaraz reached the third round of a major for the first time in his career by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili.\n\n\nIn July 2021, he reached his first ATP final at the 2021 Croatia Open Umag, defeating top seed Albert Ramos Viñolas.[18] He then won his maiden ATP title by defeating Richard Gasquet and becoming the youngest tour-level champion since 18-year-old Kei Nishikori won the Delray Beach Open in 2008. Alcaraz was the youngest Spaniard to win an ATP Tour title since Nadal claimed his first trophy in Sopot in 2004.[19]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Daniil Medvedev. At the Winston-Salem Open, Alcaraz reached the round of 16 defeating qualifier Alexei Popyrin, and his second tour-level quarterfinal of the season defeating fourth seed Márton Fucsovics.[20] He defeated Marcos Giron to reach the semifinals,[21] where he lost to Mikael Ymer.\n\n\nAt the US Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth-set tiebreak to reach the fourth round in the biggest win of his career.[22] At 18 years of age, Alcaraz became the youngest man in a major fourth round since 17-year-old Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open, and the youngest man in the US Open fourth round since 17-year-old Michael Chang and 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1989.[23][24] He then reached the quarterfinals by defeating qualifier Peter Gojowczyk. Alcaraz became the youngest US Open men's quarterfinalist in the Open Era, the youngest at the tournament since 18-year-old Thomaz Koch in 1963, and the youngest Grand Slam tournament men's singles quarterfinalist since 18-year-old Michael Chang at the 1990 French Open. He then lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime via retirement in the second set in the quarterfinals after injuring his leg.[25]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini, his second win over a top-10 player,[26] and became the youngest player in the top 35 on 1 November. During his Paris Masters run, Alcaraz defeated French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in three thrilling sets in the first round.[27] He then defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the second round, his third win over a top-10 player.[28] In the third round, he was defeated by Hugo Gaston in straight sets.[29]\n\n\nAt the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz defeated Brandon Nakashima, Juan Manuel Cerúndolo, and Holger Rune in the round-robin stage. He beat Sebastian Baez in the semifinal, and Sebastian Korda in the final.[30][31][32][33]\n\n\n\n### 2022: First major, youngest world No. 1, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\nSeeded for the first time in a major at No. 31, Alcaraz reached the third round of the Australian Open before losing in five sets to Matteo Berrettini.[34]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the Rio Open, Alcaraz won his first ATP 500 title by defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[35] He entered the top 20 in the singles rankings on 21 February 2022. In Indian Wells, Alcaraz reached his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal and semifinal, defeating defending champion Cameron Norrie before losing to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\nSeeded 14th at the Miami Open, Alcaraz defeated 6th seed Casper Ruud to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest men's champion in the tournament's history and the third-youngest ATP Masters 1000 titlist in history.[36]\n\n\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz lost in the second round to Sebastian Korda.[37] At the Barcelona Open, Alcaraz defeated top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals[38] to enter the top 10 in rankings for the first time on 25 April.[39][40] He became the 20th teen to break into top 10 overall since rankings were established in 1973, and the youngest since Rafael Nadal also on 25 April 2005.[41][42] Alcaraz later defeated Pablo Carreño Busta to win the title.[43]\n\n\nA day after his 19th birthday at the Madrid Open, he defeated 5-time Madrid champion, world No. 4 and third seed Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to become the first teenager to defeat him on clay.[44] The following day, he beat the world No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for his 6th straight top-10 win, and became the youngest player to win a match against a world No. 1 since 2004. He also became the first player to ever beat Djokovic and Nadal back-to-back on clay.[36][45][46] In the final, he won his fourth title for the season (and second Masters 1000), by defeating defending champion and world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, thereby defeating the top three seeds in three consecutive matches. He also became the youngest champion in tournament history.[47] As a result, he climbed to a career-high of world No. 6 in the rankings on 9 May 2022.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships\nFollowing his withdrawal from the Italian Open due to an ankle injury,[49] Alcaraz made his seeded debut at the French Open as No. 6. Having won two of the tour's biggest titles on clay coming into the Slam, he was widely projected to be one of the favorites for the title.[50] He defeated Juan Ignacio Londero in straight sets before saving a match point in a second round five-setter against Albert Ramos Viñolas.[51][52] He then defeated Korda and Karen Khachanov in straight sets before losing to Zverev, in the second major quarterfinal of his career.[53][54][55]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Alcaraz beat Jan-Lennard Struff in a close five set match before defeating Tallon Griekspoor and Oscar Otte in straight sets, reaching the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the fourth round.\n\n\nAt the Hamburg Open, he reached the final, resulting in a new career-high of world No. 5 on 25 July 2022. Alcaraz became the youngest player to enter the top 5 in rankings since Nadal in 2005.[56][57] He was defeated in the final by Lorenzo Musetti, resulting in the first loss in a tournament final of his career.[58] At the Croatia Open, he reached his second consecutive final, resulting in another ranking jump to world No. 4 on 1 August.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evolution of Carlos Alcaraz compared to the \"Big Three\" in the ATP RANKING from 17 to 20 years old, on the left the starting ranking and the names of the players can be seen, and the highest ranking reached in the period are on the right.\nAlcaraz entered the 2022 US Open as the No. 3 seed.[61] He defeated Sebastian Baez, Federico Coria and Jenson Brooksby without dropping a set to reach the fourth round.[62] Next he defeated 15th seed Marin Čilić in five sets, becoming the youngest man to reach back-to-back quarterfinals at this Major in the Open Era.[63] In his quarterfinal match he defeated Jannik Sinner, saving a match point in the fourth set. The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 5 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which he first achieved in September 2021. Rublev has won 14 ATP Tour singles titles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters. He has a career-high doubles ranking of No. 44, achieved on 6 November 2023. He has won four doubles titles, including an Olympic gold medal in the mixed doubles at the 2020 Summer Olympics with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Madrid Open with Karen Khachanov.\n\n\nIn his junior career, Rublev won the 2014 French Open singles title, defeating Jaume Munar in the final.[4] He won the bronze medal in singles and the silver in doubles at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing. Rublev broke into the top 10 of the ATP Tour in October 2020. He has reached the quarterfinals of all four majors, but is the male player of the Open Era to have done so the most times without progressing to the semifinals (holding an 0–9 record in major quarterfinals).[5] He was part of the successful Russian Davis Cup team in 2021. He won his first doubles title at the 2015 Kremlin Cup with Dmitry Tursunov, and among his singles titles are home victories in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAndrey Rublev (Андрей Андреевич Рублёв) was born in Moscow to Andrey Rublev Sr., a former professional boxer turned restaurant manager,[6] and Marina Marenko (née Tyurakova; Тюракова), a tennis coach at the Spartak Tennis Club.[7] His mother worked with tennis players such as Anna Kournikova and received the Medal of the Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\" in 2009. She is also the mother of Anna Arina Marenko, Rublev's older half-sister and former professional tennis player.[8]\n\n\nRublev has Austrian ancestry on his paternal side, through his grandmother Larisa Genrikhovna Rubleva.[9] He often credits his paternal grandparents for raising him as a child for five days a week until he was 15.[10] Rublev denies the claims his mother used to be harsh towards him: \"She was definitely not harsh. My parents always did everything for me. They love me very much\".[11][12] His maternal grandfather, Andrey Fyodorovich Tyurakov was a pro-coach in Greco-Roman wrestling, an amateur tennis player and doubles partner of Boris Sobkin, a coach of professional tennis player Mikhail Youzhny and sparring partner of Grand Slam doubles champion Olga Morozova in her prime years.[13][14]\n\n\nIn 2013, however, Belarusian Sergey Tarasevich became his other coach. Then Tarasevich was replaced by Fernando Vicente from Spain.[15]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev playing at the 2013 junior US Open\nRublev debuted in Luxembourg at age 13, getting his first win in his second competition in Phoenix.[16] In the following years, Rublev could climb the third rounds in singles and in December 2012 he won one of the top junior competitions, the Orange Bowl.[16]\n\n\nNext, in spring of 2013, Rublev achieved the NWU Pukke/RVTA Junior ITF 1 cup in Potchefstroom, South Africa. He successfully competed in following tournaments, especially on clay surface, including the Trofeo Bonfiglio in Milan, and became quarter-finalist at the 2014 Australian Open junior singles. At the doubles competition he paired with German Alexander Zverev, reaching the quarter-finals. The first notable win was at the 2014 French Open junior singles, crushing Jaume Munar.[16] There he also reached the semifinals with partner Stefan Kozlov, before being knocked down by Frenchmen and future winners Benjamin Bonzi / Quentin Halys.[17] He became ITF Junior player World No. 1 on 9 June 2014 after winning the 2014 Junior French Open.[18]\n\n\nShortly before Wimbledon, Rublev captured the cup at the Nike Junior International Roehampton in Roehampton, Great Britain. In the Wimbledon Championships, Rublev reached the third round before being beaten by 1842nd-ranked Dutch van Rijthoven in three tight sets.[19] In doubles, Rublev and Kozlov lost to Brazilians Orlando Luz and Marcelo Zormann in three sets, attaining his first junior Grand Slam final in doubles.[20]\n\n\nRublev took a break before competing at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, where he played in all three events as first-seeded. In singles, he lost to Kamil Majchrzak in three sets, but received a bronze medal for beating Jumpei Yamasaki. Partnering with fellow Karen Khachanov in doubles, Rublev reached the finals, where they again lost to Brazilians Luz and Zormann. He and his mixed partner Daria Kasatkina only reached the second round, where they were defeated by silver medalists Ye Qiuyu and Yamazaki.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Rublev finished his junior career by winning the inaugural ITF Junior Masters in Chengdu, China. In the final, the Russian beat Taylor Fritz in three sets.[21]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2014: Early career and Davis Cup debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2014 Kremlin Cup\nRublev debuted at the Bulgaria F6 Futures, reaching the quarterfinals. He continued his career in Bulgaria, where he again reached the quarterfinals, but became runner-up in doubles. The 15-year-old reached his first ITF Futures final in 2013 in Minsk, Belarus. After an unsuccessful fall, he recorded his first win at the USA F31 Futures in Bradenton, Florida.\n\n\nIn the 2014 Tour he started in Kazakhstan, reaching a semifinal and a final in the two Futures events in Aktobe, respectively. In the latter he beat Belarusian Yaraslav Shyla for his second win. Rublev reached the final of the Czech F1 Futures in doubles, partnering with Pole Andriej Kapaś, and continued his success in the Russian F3 Futures in Moscow, becoming champion in singles and runner-up in the doubles competition.[17]\n\n\n\n### 2015: ATP debut, First doubles title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2015 Wimbledon qualifying round\nIn 2015, Rublev entered his first ATP tournament in Delray Beach, where he reached the second round losing to Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRublev made his debut at the Davis Cup, where in the second round play-off of the Europe Zone Group I, in the third rubber, he partnered with Konstantin Kravchuk and won the match against the Portuguese team Gastão Elias / João Sousa in three sets.[22]\n\n\nThe Russian participated at his first Masters 1000 entry in Miami, where he defeated Pablo Carreño Busta, but lost to John Isner. He entered the clay season at the Barcelona Open, where as a qualifier he reached the second round after overcoming Fernando Verdasco.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith his win over Finn Jarkko Nieminen at Geneva Open, 17-year-old Rublev repeated Nadal's success in winning at least once on five ATP tournaments in one season as a teenager who is under 18 years old. (Nadal did that in 2004.)[23][24]\n\n\nRublev was called for the Davis Cup team in the 2015 Davis Cup Europea/Africa Zone Group I match against Spain, held in Vladivostok. After losing his first match against Tommy Robredo, Rublev won his second match against Pablo Andújar in the decisive fifth rubber to complete a 0–2 comeback for Russia against five-time champion Spain. This secured team Russia a place in the World Group play-offs. Russia played in the World Group play-offs last time in 2012, losing then to Brazil 0–5.[25]\n\n\nHe made his major debut at 2015 US Open as a qualifier. Rublev won his first ATP title at the 2015 Kremlin Cup in doubles, partnering with comeback Dmitry Tursunov.\n\n\n\n### 2016: Challenger title[edit]\n\n\nRublev started the 2016 year at the Chennai Open, losing to Stan Wawrinka in the second round. He reached only the first and second rounds of ATP 250 and Challenger tournaments. In March, this poor performance led to his decision to part ways with his coach Sergey Tarasevich. Immediately after that, on 6 March 2016 he made a turn by winning his first Challenger in singles, defeating Paul-Henri Mathieu in Quimper, France. As a result, Rublev jumped 47 positions from 208th to 161st ranking position, a new career-high.[26] In April, he joined 4Slam Academy in Barcelona, run by Galo Blanco.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2017: First ATP title & Major quarterfinal, top 50[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships\nRublev started well in the 2017 ATP World Tour, reaching the second round of the Australian Open after qualifying. On the way he beat 60th-ranked Yen-Hsun Lu, but then lost to Andy Murray. Rublev was successful in some Challenger tournaments. He reached the 2017 Open de Rennes Challenger final, losing there to Belarusian Uladzimir Ignatik. Again in Quimper, France, Rublev reached the semifinals, losing to Peter Gojowczyk. Rublev also reached the semifinals in Irving, Texas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Russian had some success on grass-court tournaments. He got into the quarterfinals of the Halle Open, losing there to his compatriot Karen Khachanov in a tight match. In the next tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, Rublev could reach round two, losing there to Albert Ramos Viñolas. Despite losing in the qualification round, Rublev as lucky loser reached his first ATP singles final at the Umag Open, beating in the quarterfinals defending champion Fabio Fognini. In the final, he beat Paolo Lorenzi in straight sets to win his first ATP singles title. It was the seventh time that a lucky loser would win a tournament, the last tennis player doing so at that time was Rajeev Ram in 2009 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.[28] He reached the top 50 at World No. 49 on 24 July 2017.[29]\n\n\nRublev went on to compete at the 2017 US Open as a direct entrant. He grabbed his first win against top-10 player, beating No. 9 Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets and made it through to the quarterfinals, beating David Goffin in the fourth round in straight sets. Rublev lost in straight sets to world No. 1 and eventual champion, Rafael Nadal, in the quarterfinals.[30]\n\n\nHe qualified for the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan and made it into the finals, but lost to Hyeon Chung.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2018: First Masters doubles final[edit]\n\n\nRublev commenced the 2018 season in Doha, where he went to the final, eventually losing in straight sets to Gaël Monfils.\nNext, he reached the round of 32 of the Australian Open, where he was seeded for the first time in a Grand Slam event at No. 30, but lost to third seed Grigor Dimitrov, in four sets.[31]\n\n\nRublev continued his run of good form by reaching back-to-back quarterfinals in Montepellier and Rotterdam, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Grigor Dimitrov, respectively. The Russian then had a first round exit in Acapulco, losing to David Ferrer. He did not compete at the 2018 French Open or 2018 Wimbledon due to a back injury he sustained at the Monte Carlo Masters where he lost in the third round to Dominic Thiem after having had a match point.[32]\n\n\nLater in the season after returning to active play he lost to Frenchman Jérémy Chardy in the first round of the US Open.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Top 10 wins, second ATP title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2019 Paris Masters\nRublev opened 2019 by making the round of sixteen in Doha at a tournament in which he had been the runner-up in the previous year. This loss came at the hand of the fifth seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili who defeated Rublev in straight sets in only 61 minutes.[33] Next, in the 2019 Australian Open, Rublev lost in four sets in the first round to American Mackenzie McDonald.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the Hamburg European Open, Rublev achieved his second win over a top 10 player by defeating the top seed and World No. 4 Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals. He lost to Georgian 4th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili in the final.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn August, Rublev had the biggest win of his career so far at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he defeated World No. 3 Roger Federer in the third round in straight sets, handing Federer his fastest loss in some sixteen years.[34] Rublev then went onto to lose to the tournament's eventual winner Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals.[35]\n\n\nAt the US Open, the unseeded Rublev defeated eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets in the first round. In the second round, Rublev won the first set against Gilles Simon, but Simon retired early in the second set, sending Rublev into the third round. There he defeated Australian Nick Kyrgios in straight sets, catapulting him to the round of 16 at a Grand Slam tournament for the second time.[36] There, he lost in straight sets to Matteo Berrettini.[37]\n\n\nLater in the 2019 campaign, Rublev lost in the second round to Fabio Fognini, in straight sets, at the China Open in Beijing, after having beaten Grigor Dimitrov in the first round.[38]\n\n\nOn his 22nd birthday, Rublev won his second ATP title at the Kremlin Cup, defeating the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, in straight sets in the final.[39]\n\n\n\n### 2020: Five ATP titles, World No. 8[edit]\n\n\nRublev entered the 2020 ATP season by winning back-to-back titles. Not allowed to compete in the newly established ATP Cup, as only a country's top two singles tennis players qualified, Rublev instead entered the Qatar Open, this time winning the trophy as he failed to do so two years ago. Next, Rublev took part in the maiden 2020 Adelaide International. Third-seeded, Rublev overcame Canadian Félix Auger-Aliassime in a three-set marathon match in the semifinal, before reaching the final and soundly defeating qualifier Lloyd Harris. Together with his results at 2019 Davis Cup Finals, this was 12th consecutive win for Rublev. He became the first player to win two ATP tournaments in the first two weeks of the season since 2004, when Dominik Hrbatý won tournaments in Adelaide and Auckland.[40]\n\n\nNext up for Rublev was the first of the year's four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian Open where Rublev extended his early 2020 undefeated winning streak to 11 matches by coming from behind for a four-set third round Victory over the 11th seed David Goffin of Belgium. His unbeaten 2020 run then ended the fourth round where he lost in straight sets to the seventh seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, who advanced to his first Australian Open quarterfinal.[41][42]\n\n\nNext in the Rotterdam Open, the seventh-seeded Rublev advanced into the quarterfinals with a round of 16 victory over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan. However, he then lost in straight sets to Filip Krajinović of Serbia who then advanced to the semifinals.[43]\nThen, in February at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Rublev made it to the quarterfinals where he lost in straight sets to the unseeded Dan Evans of Great Britain.[44]\n\n\nAfter tournaments that should have started but were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the late 2020 season saw a number of replacement exhibition tournaments. Rublev participated at the Adria Tour, taking place in the Balkans. The tournament was split into four groups of four players each. Rublev, playing in the Alexander Zverev group, in Zadar, Croatia, beat Marin Čilić, Danilo Petrović and Zverev to qualify into the final, where would have competed with Novak Djokovic. However, one of the participants, Grigor Dimitrov, was tested positive for the coronavirus, and so the final match was cancelled.[45]\n\n\nLater in the season when competition resumed prior to the US Open, Rublev lost in three sets in a two out of three-set-match to British player Dan Evans in the opening round of the Western & Southern Open, which was played this year at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, home of the US Open, instead of Mason, Ohio, where it is traditionally being held.[46] Seeded 10th at the US Open, Rublev defeated Jérémy Chardy and Grégoire Barrère,[47] Salvatore Caruso,[48] all in straight sets. Rublev's round of 16 match pitted was a rematch against a player he lost to in the same round in 2019, the fifth seed Matteo Berrettini. This time, Rublev won in four sets and advanced to his second US Open quarterfinal.[49] He then lost in his quarterfinal match to Daniil Medvedev in straight sets with two tiebreakers.[50]\n\n\nNext, Rublev achieved his third tour title of the year at the Hamburg European Open, where in the final he defeated second seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets.[51] However, Tsitsipas returned serve by defeating Rublev in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2020 French Open. However, this performance guaranteed him a place in the top ten of the ATP rankings on 12 October 2020.[52] Rublev then won his fourth title of the year at the St. Petersburg Open, defeating seventh seed Borna Ćorić, in straight sets.[53] He reached a career-high of World No. 8 on 19 October 2020.[29]\n\n\nIn late October, Rublev achieved his fifth title of 2020 by winning the Vienna Open as the fifth seed. He defeated qualifier Norbert Gombos in straight sets to win his first match of the tournament. Rublev would then beat Jannik Sinner in three sets with Sinner retiring after only three games due to injury. Rublev would then upset second seed and defending champion Dominic Thiem. Rublev would then eliminate Kevin Anderson, Anderson would retire in the second set due to injury. Rublev won his match with Anderson. Rublev would then defeat lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego to win the 2020 Vienna Open singles title.[54] With this win, Rublev qualified for the ATP Finals in London, which was his first ATP Finals appearance.[55]\n\n\nIn mid-November, at the ATP Finals, Rublev was placed in Group London 2020, where he would be eliminated in the round-robin phase. He started off his ATP-Finals debut with a match against Rafael Nadal – the second seed. Nadal beat Rublev. Two days after his loss, Rublev would face off against defending champion and sixth seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas. In his match, Rublev got match point on serve during the deciding set tiebreaker, but he double faulted, and lost the tiebreak and the match. Tsitsipas won. With his loss, Rublev was eliminated from the tournament.[56] Two days later, Rublev faced his final opponent: third seed Dominic Thiem whom Rublev defeated to conclude his ATP Final debut.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Olympic mixed doubles gold, World No. 5[edit]\n\n\nRublev started his 2021 season with a title at the ATP Cup, a country-based team event. Playing for Russia, in a team with Daniil Medvedev, Aslan Karatsev, and Evgeny Donskoy, Rublev bested Argentina's Guido Pella and Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka in the group stage to help his team advance into the semifinals. There he defeated Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, coming back from a set down to win. In the final of the ATP Cup, Rublev beat Italy's Fabio Fognini in straight sets.[58]\n\n\nRublev advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open after defeating Yannick Hanfmann, Thiago Monteiro, Feliciano López, and Casper Ruud.\n\n\nRublev then won the Rotterdam Open, defeating Márton Fucsovics in the final. He also bested top-ten player Tsitsipas en route to the final. With this title, Rublev reached a twenty match winning streak at ATP Tour 500 tournaments, which is the third longest ATP 500 winning streak in tennis history.[59]\n\n\nThe next week, he went on to win doubles at the Qatar Open partnering Aslan Karatsev but lost his first singles match to Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal. Rublev's previous rounds were won by walkovers due to his opponents' injuries.[60] The week after, at the 2021 Dubai Tennis Championships he extended his winning streak to twenty one matches with his victory over Emil Ruusuvuori in the second round. With this 21st consecutive win at ATP 500 events, Rublev tied Andy Murray for the second-longest winning streak at the tournament level (since 2009) and also second overall, the only other player to own a longer run of ATP 500 victories being Roger Federer (28).[61] Rublev went on to reach the semifinals defeating Taylor Fritz and Márton Fucsovics in the quarterfinals (for the third time in 2021), losing to wildcard and eventual champion Aslan Karatsev in the semifinals.[62][63]\n\n\nIn April, seeded fourth, Rublev reached his first semifinal at a Masters 1000 level at the 2021 Miami Open[64][65] where he was defeated by the eventual champion Hubert Hurkacz.[66]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Rublev reached his first singles Masters 1000 final, defeating 11-time champion Rafael Nadal en route. Although he lost to Tsitsipas in the championship match, he reached a career-high of world No. 7 and overtook Roger Federer in the rankings for the first time in his career.[67][68]\n\n\nAt the 2021 French Open Rublev was upset in the first round in 5 sets by Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany.[69][70]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Wimbledon Championships Rublev reached the fourth round for the first time in his career defeating 26th seed Fabio Fognini.[71] This marked the first time three Russian players reached the fourth round at the All England Club since 2006, when Elena Dementieva, Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova made their run.[72] He was finally defeated by Márton Fucsovics whom he beat in 5 consecutive meetings between the two since his win at the 2020 French Open including Fucsovics's withdrawal in Qatar.[73]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, he won the mixed doubles title with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeating compatriots Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina in the final. Rublev was playing mixed doubles for the first time in his professional career and has no plans to continue until the next Olympics.[74][75]\n\n\nAt the Western & Southern Open, Rublev reached his second Masters 1000 final defeating Marin Čilić, Gaël Monfils, Benoît Paire in the quarterfinals[76] and compatriot and top seed Daniil Medvedev in the semifinal, his maiden win over the World No. 2 and the biggest win of his career.[77] In the final, he lost to Alexander Zverev in straight sets. The match, lasting just 59 minutes, was the shortest final contested in the history of the tournament.[78][79]\n\n\nAt the final Grand Slam event of the year, the 2021 US Open, Rublev was seeded fifth in lieu of the absence of such players as Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem. He lost in five sets in the third round to Frances Tiafoe of the United States.[80] As a result of this run, he made his Top 5 debut on 13 September 2021.[29]\n\n\nAt the 2021 San Diego Open, he reached his eighth semifinal of the year, defeating 6th seed Diego Schwartzman.[81]\n\n\nAt the 2021 BNP Paribas Open, he reached the final in doubles partnering Aslan Karatsev where they were defeated by John Peers/Filip Polášek duo. As a result, he reached a new career-high ranking in doubles of No. 59 on 18 October 2021.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Two Major quarterfinals, four titles, ATP Finals semifinalist[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nRublev reached the third round of the 2022 Australian Open where he was defeated by Marin Čilić.[82]\n\n\nRublev reached his first final of 2022 at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating three French players en route Richard Gasquet, Lucas Pouille and ninth seed Benjamin Bonzi with all matches going to three sets.[83] He defeated world No. 9 Félix Auger-Aliassime for his ninth singles title.\nAt the same tournament he reached the quarterfinals with Ukrainian Denys Molchanov.[84] The duo won against the French pair of Bonzi/Albano Olivetti to reach the semifinals and Hugo Gaston/Holger Rune to reach also the final. He lifted the doubles trophy as well just hours after winning the singles to make it a Marseille double against South African Raven Klaasen and Japanese Ben McLachlan. With the victory, he became just the third player to sweep both the singles and doubles titles in the tournament's 30-year history.[85]\n\n\nOn 26 February, Rublev won the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championship in Dubai, UAE defeating the Czech player Jiří Veselý in straight set to gain his tenth ATP singles title.[86] Rublev also made international news headlines when, after winning his semifinal match, he wrote \"No war please\" on a camera lens a few days into the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[87]\n\n\nNext Rublev defeated 33rd seed Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals at the 2022 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells before losing in straight sets in the semifinals to the 20th seed and eventual champion American Taylor Fritz.[88]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Rublev defeated in three sets world No. 1 ranked Novak Djokovic, in the final of 2022 Serbia Open.[89] At Roland Garros, Rublev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost in a fifth set tiebreak to 20th seed Marin Čilić.\n\n\nThe All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Rublev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[90]\n\n\nSeeded ninth at the US Open he reached the fourth round, defeating 19th seed Denis Shapovalov in a five set thriller with a fifth set super tiebreak lasting over four hours, for the fourth time at this Major.[91] Next he defeated 7th seed Cameron Norrie in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals, where he was subsequently defeated by Frances Tiafoe.[92]\n\n\nRublev won his fourth title of the year at the Gijón Open in Spain defeated Sebastian Korda in straight sets.[93]\n\n\nSeeded sixth, the world No. 7 Rublev qualified for his third ATP Finals in a row and reached the semifinals for the first time defeating two former season finale champions world No. 5 Daniil Medvedev and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas to set up a meeting with world No. 4 Casper Ruud.[94][95] In the semifinal, he lost in straight sets to Ruud.[96]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 250th career win, First Masters Title & 3 Grand Slam Quarter-Finals, Shanghai Final[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships\nRublev advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open for the second time, where he then lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic, winning just seven games.[97]\n\n\nRublev reached his first final of the year in Dubai as the defending champion defeating Filip Krajinović, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Botic van de Zandschulp & Alexander Zverev (for the first time) before losing to Daniil Medvedev.[98]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he recorded his 250th career win by defeating Jaume Munar. Rublev became the 25th active men's player to record 250 career wins, the ninth man born in 1990 or later to achieve the feat, and just the fourth man born in 1995 or later to do it after Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.[99] Following wins over Karen Khachanov, Jan-Lennard Struff, Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune he lifted his first Masters 1000 trophy, the biggest of his career. In the final, Rublev defeated Rune in three sets, coming from 1–4 down in the third set to claim victory.[100]\n\n\nAt the Banja Luka Open, he reached his second consecutive clay court final following wins over Juan Pablo Varillas, Damir Džumhur, and Alex Molčan, but lost to Dušan Lajović in the final in three sets.\nNext, at the 2023 Mutua Madrid Open, he reached the fourth round in singles but lost to compatriot Karen Khachanov. In doubles, the pair went on to win the title after defeating seventh seeds Matthew Ebden/Rohan Bopanna in the final.\n\n\nHe reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the first time in his career, defeating Max Purcell, Aslan Karatsev, David Goffin & Alexander Bublik before losing to Novak Djokovic in 4 sets.\nRublev won the Swedish Open, defeating Casper Ruud in the final.[101]\n\n\nSeeded eight at the US Open, Rublev lost to Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals, becoming the first player to lose his first nine Major quarterfinals.[102][103]\n\n\nSeeded fifth at the China Open he reached the second round defeating Cameron Norrie but lost to Ugo Humbert.[104] At the same tournament, in doubles he reached the semifinals with Karen Khachanov.[105]\nAlso seeded fifth at the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he defeated this time 32nd seed Ugo Humbert and 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov to reach his second Masters final of the season.[106] He became the only player, male or female, to record 50 wins in each of the past three years.[107] He lost in the final to 16th seed Hubert Hurkacz.[108]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nRublev is an offensive baseliner with a big forehand – his favorite shot, and has a dangerous and consistent two-handed backhand. His running forehand is particularly lethal because of his consistency and comfort with the shot, making many passing shots with it. Despite his power, Rublev is often hyper-aggressive and can enter situations where he makes consecutive unforced errors, causing technical and mental difficulty to follow. However, he can also demonstrate periods when his forehand is elusive. He states that he does not prefer a particular tennis surface.[16]\n\n\nRublev has a powerful first serve that often reaches 200+ km/h (125+ mph). His second serve, however, is underwhelming because of his high number of double faults during matches, as well as being much slower than his first serve. In 2020, Yevgeny Kafelnikov said the following about Rublev's game: \"I think his whole game, it just has some elements of playing junior tennis, hitting the ball harder and harder. If he improves in those two departments, his footwork and second serve, his whole game is going to change.\"[109]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nRublev has been endorsed by Head for racquets,[110] Italian luxury brand Bulgari for watches, and Penhaligon's for perfume.[111] He used to be endorsed by Wilson for racquets and by Nike for apparel and shoes.[112] In 2023, Rublev launched his own clothing brand Rublo, that is \"not about clothes\". Rublo has been created to drive awareness around equality and kindness with the hope of making our world a better place, as he claims.[113]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nOutside tennis, Rublev practises boxing and basketball, and he is particularly interested in Mike Tyson.[114] Rublev also creates his own electronic music like his idols – Martin Garrix and Alan Walker.[115] Rublev is nicknamed the \"Rubl'\", akin to the Russian word 'ruble'. He speaks Russian, English, and Spanish, and also is a longtime fan of the Golden State Warriors (NBA),[116] and has been regularly following football matches as a supporter of FC Barcelona.[117]\n\n\nRublev is an Orthodox Christian and can be regularly seen crossing himself after matches.[118][119] He is the godfather to Daniil Medvedev’s daughter, Alisa.[120]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Andrey Rublev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner;

In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia. In December 2010, he won his first junior title as a qualifier at just his third tournament.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n2012–2013 would see Medvedev surge on the junior circuit as he won six titles between October 2012 and July 2013 which included four consecutive titles.

Three weeks later he earned his first singles ATP World Tour win at the 2016 Ricoh Open, defeating Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high.

One week later, he on grass advanced to the semifinal of Eastbourne International, losing to Novak Djokovic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev registered his maiden Grand Slam match win at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, defeating fifth seed and world No. 3, Stan Wawrinka, in the first round in four sets.[29] He lost in the next round to Ruben Bemelmans.[30] Medvedev was handed three fines totaling $14,500 (£11,200) for his conduct during the match with Bemelmans: $7,000 for insulting the umpire on two occasions and $7,500 for throwing coins under the umpire's chair.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev serving at the 2017 Queen's Club Championships\n### 2018 First ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the 2018 season by qualifying for the Sydney International. He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final. This triumph brought him to a new career high ranking of No. 22 and made him the No. 1 player in Russia.

He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov. In the final, he was defeated by defending champion Rafael Nadal. Medvedev would reach a second consecutive Masters final at Cincinnati after beating defending champion Djokovic for the second time, where he defeated David Goffin in straight sets for his first Masters title.[43]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the US Open as the world No. 5.[44] In his second round match, he fought off cramping to defeat Hugo Dellien in four sets.[45] He then defeated Feliciano López in a contentious match for which he was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $4,000 for flipping off the crowd.[46][47] Medvedev next recovered from a set and a break deficit to beat Dominik Köpfer and reach his first Major quarterfinal.[48] He then beat former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals to reach his first Grand Slam final.[49][50] There, Medvedev was defeated by Rafael Nadal in five sets.[51]\n\n\nMedvedev followed up his success in North America with his maiden title on Russian soil at the St. Petersburg Open, to become the first Russian to win the tournament in 15 years.[52][53] Medvedev then won a second consecutive title at the Shanghai Masters, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.[54] By reaching the final, Medvedev became the 7th man since 2000 to reach at least nine finals in a season.[55][56][57] He ended the season losing his last four matches, including all three round robin matches in his ATP Finals debut.\n\n\n\n### 2020 ATP Finals champion, third Masters title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2020 Australian Open\nMedvedev opened his season at the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup as Russia's top ranked singles player. He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles.

At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets.

He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev represented Russia in the third edition of the ATP Cup. Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. In the final, he was defeated in five epic sets by Rafael Nadal despite taking a two-set lead. At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios.

This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round. As a result, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 to World No. 12.\n\n\nIn February, Medvedev entered the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam seeded 6th, where he made it to the finals whilst dropping only one set.

Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds.

Nobody has gotten so many balls back and neutralized so many good serves. \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### 2007: First Masters titles, first Major final & breaking top 3[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic began 2007 by defeating Australian Chris Guccione in the Adelaide final, before losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to eventual champion Roger Federer[73] in straight sets. His performances at the Masters Series events in Indian Wells, and Miami, where he was the runner-up and champion respectively, pushed him into the world's top 10.[68] Djokovic lost the Indian Wells final to Rafael Nadal, but defeated Nadal in Key Biscayne in the quarterfinals before going on to defeat Guillermo Cañas in the final to win his maiden Masters Series title.[74][75] In doing so, he became the youngest player to ever win the tournament and the first teenager to win the event since Andre Agassi in 1990.[68][75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWimbledon men's singles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| Amateur Era | * 1877: Spencer Gore\n* 1878: Frank Hadow\n* 1879: John Hartley\n* 1880: John Hartley\n* 1881: William Renshaw\n* 1882: William Renshaw\n* 1883: William Renshaw\n* 1884: William Renshaw\n* 1885: William Renshaw\n* 1886: William Renshaw\n* 1887: Herbert Lawford\n* 1888: Ernest Renshaw\n* 1889: William Renshaw\n* 1890: Willoughby Hamilton\n* 1891: Wilfred Baddeley\n* 1892: Wilfred Baddeley\n* 1893: Joshua Pim\n* 1894: Joshua Pim\n* 1895: Wilfred Baddeley\n* 1896: Harold Mahony\n* 1897: Reginald Doherty\n* 1898: Reginald Doherty\n* 1899: Reginald Doherty\n* 1900: Reginald Doherty\n* 1901: Arthur Gore\n* 1902: Laurence Doherty\n* 1903: Laurence Doherty\n* 1904: Laurence Doherty\n* 1905: Laurence Doherty\n* 1906: Laurence Doherty\n* 1907: Norman Brookes\n* 1908: Arthur Gore\n* 1909: Arthur Gore\n* 1910: Anthony Wilding\n* 1911: Anthony Wilding\n* 1912: Anthony Wilding\n* 1913: Anthony Wilding\n* 1914: Norman Brookes\n* 1919: Gerald Patterson\n* 1920: Bill Tilden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Win | 2021 | Wimbledon (6) | Grass | ![Italy](image) Matteo Berrettini | 6–7(4–7), 6–4, 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| Loss | 2021 | US Open | Hard | ![Russia](image) Daniil Medvedev | 4–6, 4–6, 4–6\n |\n| Win | 2022 | Wimbledon (7) | Grass | ![Australia](image) Nick Kyrgios | 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 7–6(7–3) |\n| Win | 2023 | Australian Open (10) | Hard | ![Greece](image) Stefanos Tsitsipas | 6–3, 7–6(7–4), 7–6(7–5) |\n| Win | 2023 | French Open (3) | Clay | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–5\n |\n| Loss | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Spain](image) Carlos Alcaraz | 6–1, 6–7(6–8), 1–6, 6–3, 4–6 |\n| Win | 2023 | US Open (4) | Hard | ![](image) Daniil Medvedev | 6–3, 7–6(7–5), 6–3\n |\n\n\n### Year–End Championships performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Djokovic celebrating Australian Open triumph in Belgrade.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Dubai Championships, where he lost in the semifinals to Roddick.

In April, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to David Goffin.

Nevertheless, he went on to reach the final of the US Open, where he had five set points in the first set and two in the second set, but lost them all before losing the match in straight sets to the top-seeded Federer.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Men's singles | * Fred Perry\n* Don Budge\n* Rod Laver (2)\n* Roy Emerson (2)\n* Andre Agassi\n* Roger Federer\n* Rafael Nadal (2)\n* Novak Djokovic (3)\n |\n| Women's singles | * Maureen Connolly\n* Doris Hart\n* Shirley Fry Irvin\n* Margaret Court (3)\n* Billie Jean King\n* Chris Evert (2)\n* Martina Navratilova (2)\n* Steffi Graf (4)\n* Serena Williams (3)\n* Maria Sharapova\n |\n| Men's doubles | * Adrian Quist\n* Frank Sedgman (2)\n* Ken McGregor\n* Lew Hoad / Ken Rosewall (2)\n* Neale Fraser (2)\n* Roy Emerson (3)\n* John Newcombe (3) / Tony Roche\n* Bob Hewitt\n* John Fitzgerald\n* Anders Järryd\n* Jacco Eltingh / Paul Haarhuis\n* Mark Woodforde\n* Todd Woodbridge\n* Jonas Björkman\n* Bob Bryan (2) / Mike Bryan (2)\n* Daniel Nestor\n* Leander Paes\n* Pierre-Hugues Herbert / Nicolas Mahut\n* Mate Pavić\n |\n| Women's doubles | * Louise Brough Clapp\n* Doris Hart\n* Shirley Fry Irvin\n* Maria Bueno\n* Lesley Turner Bowrey\n* Margaret Court (2)\n* Judy Tegart-Dalton\n* Kathy Jordan / Anne Smith\n* / Martina Navratilova (7)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter being unable to play in March, Djokovic began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters in April.

In the semifinals, he defeated Casper Ruud for his 1,000th career win, becoming only the fifth man in the Open Era to reach this milestone.[385] In the final, he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to win his sixth Italian Open and record-extending 38th Masters title.[386]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Novak Djokovic (Achievement predecessor & successor)\n |\n| --- |\n| | Sporting positions\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal Roger FedererRafael NadalRafael NadalRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos Alcaraz\n |  **World No. 1** July 4, 2011 – July 8, 2012November 5, 2012 – October 6, 2013July 7, 2014 – November 6, 2016November 5, 2018 – November 5, 2019February 3, 2020 – Feb 28, 2022Mar 21, 2022 – Jun 12, 2022Jan 30, 2023 – Mar 19, 2023Apr 3, 2023 – May 21, 2023Jun 12, 2023 – Jun 25, 2023Sep 11, 2023 – Jun 10, 2024\n | Succeeded byRoger Federer Rafael NadalAndy MurrayRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazJannik Sinner\n |\n| Preceded byMardy Fish\n |  **US Open Series Champion** 2012 | Succeeded byRafael Nadal\n |\n| Awards\n |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal\n |  **ATP Most Improved Player** 2006, 2007 | Succeeded byJo-Wilfried Tsonga\n |\n| Preceded byOlivera JevtićNađa HiglDavor Štefanek\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1938: Don Budge\n* 1939: Don McNeill\n* 1946: Marcel Bernard\n* 1947: József Asbóth\n* 1948: Frank Parker\n* 1949: Frank Parker\n* 1950: Budge Patty\n* 1951: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1952: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1953: Ken Rosewall\n* 1954: Tony Trabert\n* 1955: Tony Trabert\n* 1956: Lew Hoad\n* 1957: Sven Davidson\n* 1958: Mervyn Rose\n* 1959: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1960: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1961: Manuel Santana\n* 1962: Rod Laver\n* 1963: Roy Emerson\n* 1964: Manuel Santana\n* 1965: Fred Stolle\n* 1966: Tony Roche\n* 1967: Roy Emerson\n |\n| Open Era | * 1968: Ken Rosewall\n* 1969: Rod Laver\n* 1970: Jan Kodeš\n* 1971: Jan Kodeš\n* 1972: Andrés Gimeno\n* 1973: Ilie Năstase\n* 1974: Björn Borg\n* 1975: Björn Borg\n* 1976: Adriano Panatta\n* 1977: Guillermo Vilas\n* 1978: Björn Borg\n* 1979: Björn Borg\n* 1980: Björn Borg\n* 1981: Björn Borg\n* 1982: Mats Wilander\n* 1983: Yannick Noah\n* 1984: Ivan Lendl\n* 1985: Mats Wilander\n* 1986: Ivan Lendl\n* 1987: Ivan Lendl\n* 1988: Mats Wilander\n* 1989: Michael Chang\n* 1990: Andrés Gómez\n* 1991: Jim Courier\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by dropping only one set en route to the semifinal, which he lost to Federer.

In the final, he avenged his US Open loss to Daniil Medvedev to win his sixth Paris Masters title and record 37th ATP Masters title overall.[348] At the 2021 ATP Finals, Djokovic was defeated in the semifinals by Zverev.[349] Djokovic finished the season by leading Serbia to the semifinals of 2021 Davis Cup Finals, where they lost to Croatia.[350]\n\n\n\n#### 2022: Travel restrictions, 1000 career wins, Wimbledon title, record 38th Masters & record 6th Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n##### Australian Open controversy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: § Opposition to COVID-19 vaccine\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA better showing at the Madrid Masters saw Djokovic reach the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets.[258] A runner-up result at the Rome Masters indicated improvement in his form.\n\n\nOn 21 May 2017, Djokovic announced that Andre Agassi would become his new coach, starting at the French Open. However, as the defending champion, he lost in the quarterfinals to Dominic Thiem.[259] He began the grass court season at the Eastbourne International, playing his first non-Wimbledon tournament on grass since 2010. He won the title by beating Gaël Monfils in the final. This was also the only tournament that Djokovic won without his coach being Marián Vajda until the duo split in 2022. He made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before retiring against Tomáš Berdych due to an elbow injury.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter splitting the first two sets in tiebreakers, Djokovic found his form after dropping his serve at the start of the third set, going on to win 12 of the last 13 games to record a four-set victory over the Scot, and win an Open Era record-breaking fifth title in Melbourne, overtaking Roger Federer and Andre Agassi.[221] He moved into equal eighth on the all-time list of men with the most Major titles, tying Agassi, Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors, Ken Rosewall and Fred Perry.[222]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter playing nearly a hundred matches in 2009, Djokovic stated that he was \"fed up with matches\", so he decided not to play any ranking tournaments before the Australian Open, thus starting his year by playing in the AAMI Classic, an exhibition event, where he beat Tommy Haas, but lost to Fernando Verdasco and teenager Bernard Tomic.[118] At the Australian Open, Djokovic lost a five-setter to Tsonga in the quarterfinals.[119] Despite the loss, he attained a career-high ranking of No. 2 and went on to reach the semifinals in Rotterdam, where he lost to Mikhail Youzhny. At the Dubai Championships, Djokovic reached the final, this time defeating Youzhny to win his first title of the year and to successfully defend a title for the first time in his career.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the 2021 Wimbledon Championships, Djokovic recorded the 100th grass-court win by reaching the semifinals,[338] and defeated Matteo Berrettini in the final to claim his sixth Wimbledon title and equal Federer and Nadal's all-time record of 20 men's singles major titles. Djokovic became the second player to win Majors on three different surfaces in the same year achieving a \"Surface Slam\"[339] and the fifth man in the Open Era to achieve the \"Channel Slam\", winning the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year.[340] Djokovic opened his summer hard court season at the Tokyo Olympics, where he sought to improve on his bronze medal result from Beijing 2008.[341] However, he lost in the semifinals to Alexander Zverev, and then to Pablo Carreño Busta in the bronze medal match. Djokovic also competed in mixed doubles partnering Nina Stojanović; the pair lost in the semifinals to Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina, then withdrew from their bronze medal match against WTA singles No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n400. **^** \"Djokovic Wins Decisive TB to Continue Dominance of Tsitsipas in Paris\".

He advanced to the final, where he lost to Tommy Haas.[109] Djokovic then lost to Haas again, this time in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.[110] During the US Open Series, Djokovic made the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open in Montreal before losing to Roddick. At the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the semifinals before losing in the final to Federer.[111] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the semifinals, where he was defeated by Federer.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic won their first two matches at the 2017 Davis Cup and 2017 Eastbourne International.[483] They next met at a major for the first time in the fourth round of the 2019 Australian Open, with Djokovic prevailing in four sets.[484] Medvedev improved their head-to-head to 3–2 with three-set wins at the quarterfinal of the 2019 Monte-Carlo Masters and the semifinal of 2019 Cincinnati Masters, the latter of which Medvedev went on to win for his maiden ATP Masters title.[485][486] They met in three finals in 2021, with Djokovic winning the Australian Open and Paris Masters and Medvedev winning the US Open.\n\n\nMedvedev replaced Djokovic as the world No. 1 player when he rose to the top ranking for the first time in February 2022.[487]\n\n\nAt the 2023 US Open Final, Djokovic beat Medvedev in a rematch of the 2021 US Open final to claim his 24th Grand Slam Title in straight sets. The second set was a grueling 104-minute battle that Djokovic won in a tiebreak.[488]\n\n\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by reaching the final without dropping a set in the first five rounds, including a quarterfinal clash with Nadal and a five-set semifinal victory over No. 3 seed Andy Murray which took two days to complete. This meant he became only the second man to have won against Nadal at the French Open. However, he lost the next match and the tournament to No. 8 seed Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[230] Five weeks later, he rebounded again from the tough loss in Paris, just like 2014, coming from two sets down to beat Kevin Anderson in the fourth round, and then going on to claim his third Wimbledon title, with a four-set win over Roger Federer.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n314. **^** \"Novak Djokovic defaulted from US Open after hitting line judge in throat\". *Sportingnews.com*. 6 September 2020.

Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.[65] The British media spoke of Djokovic's family negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.[65] The 18-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked 64th in the world, initially dismissed the story by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"[66] However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n519. **^** \"The revealing numbers behind Federer, Nadal and Djokovic's battle to be the GOAT\". *The Hindu*. 12 January 2018.

His first tour-level tournament was the Croatia Open Umag in July 2004, where he qualified for the main draw and lost to Filippo Volandri in the first round.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe returned to China Open in October, winning the title for the sixth time, defeating Nadal in straight sets in the final to bring his overall record at the tournament to 29–0.[234] Djokovic then reached the final of the Paris Masters, where he defeated Murray in straight sets, taking his fourth title there and a record sixth ATP Masters tournament in one year.[235] After losing to Federer in the round-robin stage of the ATP Finals he took on the third seed again in the final. He beat Federer in straight sets winning his fifth ATP Finals title and becoming the first player to win the Year-end Championships four consecutive times.[236]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"Ancic snuffs out Djokovic threat\".

In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and him was referred to as the \"Big Three\" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n278. **^** \"NOVAK DJOKOVIC IS A WIN AWAY FROM MAKING MASTERS HISTORY IN CINCINNATI\". *Tennis.com*.

With his 22nd Masters title, Djokovic became the first player to complete the Indian Wells – Miami title double three times.[225][226] In April, Djokovic clinched his second Monte-Carlo Masters by beating Tomáš Berdych in the final.[227] Therefore, Djokovic became the first man to win the first three ATP Masters 1000 titles of the season.[228] Djokovic withdrew from the 2015 Madrid Masters.[229] He won the title for the fourth time at the Rome Masters, making it 4 out of 4 titles in Masters events entered by Djokovic in the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2011 Australian Open — 2023 US Open | 7 seasons reaching 3+ Major finals | **Stands alone** |\n| 2015, 2021, 2023 | 3 seasons reaching all four Major finals[722] | Roger Federer |\n| 2008 Australian Open — 2023 US Open | 14 hard-court Major titles | **Stands alone** |\n| 2007 US Open — 2023 US Open | 20 hard-court Major finals | **Stands alone** |\n| 2007 US Open — 2023 US Open | Most finals appearances at both hard-court Majors | **Stands alone** |\n| ATP Masters (selected records)\n |\n| 2007–2018 | Career Golden Masters[717] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2007–2020 | Double Career Golden Masters | **Stands alone** |\n| 2007–2023 | 40 Masters singles titles | **Stands alone** |\n| 2015 | 6 Masters titles in season[723] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2015 | 8 Masters finals in season[e] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2011 | 31 consecutive Masters match wins | **Stands alone** |\n| 2015 | 39 Masters match wins in season | **Stands alone** |\n| 2015 | Winner of the season's first 3 Masters tournaments | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing Djokovic's victory over Aleksandar Kovacevic in the first round of the 2023 French Open, Djokovic wrote \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia.

This marked the first time a man outside of the Big Four was ranked singles world No. 1 since Andy Roddick in February 2004.[378] Djokovic withdrew from both the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open, due to the United States forbidding unvaccinated foreign travellers.[379] Despite being unable to play, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 ranking after Medvedev's third-round defeat at Indian Wells.[380]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Tournament | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | 1R | 1R | 4R | **W** | QF | QF | **W** | **W** | **W** | QF | **W** | **W** | 2R | 4R | **W** | **W** | **W** | A[A] | **W** |  | 10 / 18\n | 89–8\n | 92%\n |\n| French Open | 2R | QF | SF | SF | 3R | QF | SF[B] | F | SF | F | F | **W** | QF | QF | SF | F | **W** | QF | **W** |  | 3 / 19\n | 92–16\n | 85%\n |\n| Wimbledon | 3R | 4R | SF | 2R | QF | SF | **W** | SF | F | **W** | **W** | 3R | QF | **W** | **W** | NH[C] | **W** | **W** | F |  | 7 / 18\n | 92–11\n | 89%\n |\n| US Open | 3R | 3R | F | SF | SF | F | **W** | F | F | SF | **W** | F[B] | A | **W** | 4R | 4R[D] | F | A[E] | **W** |  | 4 / 17\n | 88–13\n | 87%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 5–4\n | 9–4\n | 19–4\n | 18–3\n | 15–4\n | 19–4\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic started the year at the Brisbane International, where he was upset by fellow Pilić academy trainee Ernests Gulbis in the first round.[101] As defending champion at the Australian Open, Djokovic retired from his quarterfinal match with former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, primarily due to heat illness that generated muscle aches and cramps.[102][103] After losing in the semifinals of the Open 13 tournament in Marseille to Tsonga, Djokovic won the singles title at the Dubai Championships, defeating Ferrer to claim his twelfth career title.[104] The following week, Djokovic was the defending champion at the Indian Wells Masters but lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals. At the Miami Open in Key Biscayne, Djokovic beat Federer in the semifinals, before losing to Murray in the final.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic won his fifth title of the year at the BA-CA TennisTrophy in Vienna, defeating Stanislas Wawrinka in the final. His next tournament was the Madrid Masters, where he lost to David Nalbandian in the semifinals. Djokovic, assured of finishing the year ranked No. 3, qualified for the year-ending championships, but did not advance beyond the round robin matches. He received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete in Serbia, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia declared him the best athlete in the country.[85]\n\n\nDjokovic played a key role in the 2007 play-off win over Australia by winning all his matches and helping promote the Serbia Davis Cup team to the 2008 World Group.[86] In Serbia's tie against Russia in Moscow in early 2008, Djokovic was sidelined due to influenza and missed his first singles match. He returned to win his doubles match, teaming with Nenad Zimonjić, before retiring during his singles match with Nikolay Davydenko.[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late July, Djokovic returned to form by winning his fourth Canadian Open title, and 30th Masters title overall, without dropping a set.[251] In August, Djokovic was beaten in the first round of the Olympic men's singles in Rio de Janeiro by Juan Martín del Potro. It was Djokovic's first opening round defeat since January 2009, when Ernest Gulbis defeated him at the 2009 Brisbane International.[252][253] In the final slam of the year, the US Open, Djokovic advanced to the final but was defeated by Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[254] Djokovic was defeated by Roberto Bautista Agut and Marin Čilić in the semifinals and quarterfinals of Shanghai and Paris. Due to this result, he lost the No. 1 ranking to Andy Murray.[255] However, a runner-up finish at the ATP Finals indicated his best performances in nearly three months. After the season, he parted ways with his coach of three years, Boris Becker.[256]\n\n\n\n#### 2017: Split with team and long injury hiatus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the French Open in May as the defending champion. After defeating Yoshihito Nishioka, Alex Molčan, Aljaž Bedene and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets, he faced Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals for their record-extending 59th meeting. He lost in four sets, ending his French Open title defense.[387] As a result of his quarterfinals defeat, he conceded the No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev for the second time in 2022.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas have met 13 times, with Djokovic leading 11–2, including at the 2021 French Open and 2023 Australian Open finals, both of which Djokovic won.[489][490]\n\n\nTheir first meeting took place at the third round of the 2018 Rogers Cup, with the then 19-year-old Tsitsipas, ranked No. 27, pulling an upset over Djokovic in three sets.[491] Djokovic avenged this loss by beating Tsitsipas, then ranked in the top 10, in straight sets to win the 2019 Madrid Open.[492] Tstisipas won their next match in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Shanghai Masters in three sets to bring their head-to-head to 2–1 in his favor.[493] Djokovic then won all of their next ten matches, including the 2020 French Open semifinal, 2021 French Open final, 2022 Italian Open final, and 2023 Australian Open final, the last of which also saw the two competing for the world No. 1 ranking.[489]\n\n\n\n### Carlos Alcaraz[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith his first-round win at the Wimbledon Championships against Kwon Soon-woo, Djokovic became the first player in history (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four Grand Slams.[388] With his semifinal win over Cameron Norrie, Djokovic reached a record 32nd Grand Slam final, one ahead of Roger Federer.[389] Djokovic went on to defeat Nick Kyrgios in the final in four sets for his fourth consecutive and seventh overall Wimbledon trophy.[390]\nWith this victory, he reached a total of 21 major titles, which broke his tie of 20 majors with Federer and put him one Grand Slam title behind Nadal.[391][392]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n304. **^** \"Australian Open: Novak Djokovic beats Dominic Thiem to win 17th Grand Slam\".

Afterwards, Djokovic struggled in the clay court season, suffering early defeats at the Monte-Carlo Masters[415] and the Banja Luka Open.[416] At the Italian Open, Djokovic was defeated in the quarterfinals by Holger Rune.[417]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he returned to form, reaching the semifinals to face world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, whom he defeated in four sets to reach a record-extending 34th major final. Moreover, he became the only player to contest at least seven finals at each Grand Slam tournament. Djokovic would go on to beat Casper Ruud in the final, securing a record-breaking 23rd major title and becoming the first man in tennis history to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam.[418][14] By winning the title, Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 position from Alcaraz.[419]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to his opposition to COVID-19 vaccine, Djokovic was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022,[10] notably the Australian Open and the US Open; two major events he was the favourite to win.[11][12] One year after the Australian visa controversy, Djokovic made a successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[13] and shortly after he claimed the French Open to take the outright record for most men's singles majors won in history.[14]\n\n\nRepresenting Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. He also won the bronze medal for his country at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska. His other awards include being named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year four times (2012, 2015, 2016 and 2019) and the 2011 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n335. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mission complete: Djokovic secures rare feat\". *Roland-Garros*.

The match, at 4 hours and 3 minutes, was at the time the longest three-set singles match on the ATP Tour in the Open Era.[108] At the French Open, he lost in the third round to German Philipp Kohlschreiber.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n532. **^** \"Bollettieri: Djokovic is the most complete player of all time\".

He broke his own ATP ranking points record, bringing it up to 16,790. Djokovic then proceeded to win his sixth Australian Open. On his road to his Open Era record sixth title in Melbourne, he defeated Roger Federer in four sets in the semifinals, and in a rematch of the 2015 final, he defeated Andy Murray, in three straight sets.[238] He quickly rebounded from an eye infection at the Dubai Championships to collect a fifth Indian Wells Masters title, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and Milos Raonic in the final.

In an event plagued by suspended play due to rain, Djokovic defeated the defending champion Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Marin Čilić to reach his sixth final at the tournament and fourth final against Roger Federer. Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title.

In the final, he faced Federer once again, defeating him in four sets to win his third Grand Slam title of the year, his second title at Flushing Meadows, and his tenth Grand Slam singles title overall, becoming the fifth man in the Open Era to win double-digit Grand Slam singles titles, as well as only the third man to reach all four Major finals in a calendar year.[233]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the end of the season, Djokovic made a season-record 15 consecutive finals, reaching the championship match of every top-level tournament he played (four in Majors, eight in Masters, and the final at the Year-end Championships).

After returning from injury, Djokovic won his third Rome title by beating Nadal in the final of the Italian Open.[212] He subsequently donated the $500,000 in prize money that he had received to the victims of the 2014 Southeast Europe floods.[213]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil.

Due to the federal government's vaccination policy for non-US citizens, Djokovic was unable to enter the United States to play the 2022 US Open, another major tournament he was the favorite to win.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2015 French Open final, Wawrinka defeated Djokovic in four sets to claim his second major title. Later that year, Djokovic beat Wawrinka at the Cincinnati Masters and Paris Masters.[464] At the 2016 US Open, Wawrinka beat Djokovic in a major final for a second time.[465]\n\n\nDespite Djokovic's 21–6 overall record against Wawrinka, Wawrinka leads Djokovic 3–2 in ATP finals, two of which in major finals.[466] During Djokovic's run of 13 major finals from the 2014 Wimbledon Championships through the 2020 Australian Open, his only two losses were to Wawrinka. Contrary to most high-profile rivalries, the pair have also played doubles together.[467]\n\n\n\n### Juan Martín del Potro[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic reached his maiden French Open final by defeating Roger Federer,[168] reaching the final of all four majors consecutively. Djokovic had the chance to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major titles at once, having won last year's Wimbledon and US Open titles as well as this year's Australian Open, but was beaten by Nadal in the final in four sets.[169][170] Following the French Open, Djokovic failed to defend his title in Wimbledon, losing to Roger Federer in four sets in the semifinals.[171]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReuniting with longtime coach Marián Vajda at the Monte-Carlo Masters, Djokovic collected victories over Dušan Lajović and Borna Ćorić, followed by a loss to Dominic Thiem. In a press conference, he stated, \"After two years finally I can play without pain.\"[267] After another early exit in Barcelona to Martin Kližan,[268] Djokovic's gradual return to form would appear at the Madrid Masters. With a first round win over Kei Nishikori, Djokovic achieved his first victory over a top 20 player in 10 months; however, he lost in the second round to Kyle Edmund.[269][270] Going into the Rome Masters with a 6–6 season record, he reached the semifinals before losing to long-time rival Rafael Nadal.[271] He then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open before losing to Marco Cecchinato.[272]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_DCElmnKqUZ1ogDup4vRTH7BN","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and at the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula.[10] The population of the Belgrade metropolitan area is 1,681,405 according to the 2022 census.[4] It is one of the major cities of Southeast Europe and the third most populous city on the Danube river.\n\n\nBelgrade is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe and the world. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vinča culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it *Singidūn*.[11] It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century.[12] It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarević, and then his successor Đurađ Branković returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo.[13] It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Ottoman–Habsburg wars.\n\n\nFollowing the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was once again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006.[note 2] In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.[14]\n\n\nBeing Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia.[15] It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home to almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City.[16] The city is home to the University Clinical Centre of Serbia, a hospital complex with one of the largest capacities in the world; the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings; and the Štark Arena, one of the largest capacity indoor arenas in Europe.\n\n\nBelgrade hosted major international events such as the Danube River Conference of 1948, the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977–1978), the Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three times (1961, 1975, 2005). On 21 June 2023, Belgrade was confirmed host of the BIE-sanctioned Specialized Exhibition Expo 2027.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Belgrade and Timeline of Belgrade history\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Prehistoric sites in Serbia and Prehistory of Southeastern Europe\n\n![](image)Vinča culture figurine, 4000–4500 BC.\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry—belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.[18]\nThe first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Starčevo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC.[19] There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Starčevo. The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the Vinča culture (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starčevo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vinča-Belo Brdo). The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe.[20] Also associated with the Vinča culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinča, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe,[21] and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC.[22] Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human dated to before 5000 BC was discovered in 1890.[23]\n\n\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Serbia in the Roman era\n\n![](image)Belgrade Fortress, built during a long period of time from the 2nd to the 18th century, located on the confluence of the two rivers Sava and Danube\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts.[24][25] In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings.[26] Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi;[11] following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it *Singidūn* (*d|ūn*, fortress).[11] In 34–33 BC, the Roman army reached Belgrade. It became the romanised *Singidunum* in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a *municipium* by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged *colonia* (the highest city class) by the end of the century.[12] While the first Christian Emperor of Rome—Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great[27]—was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum.[28] Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire.[29] Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.[30]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Serbia in the Middle Ages\n\n![](image)\nSiege of Belgrade (1456)\n![](image)\nConquest of Belgrade, 1521, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Belgrade Fortress\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun.[31] In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy.[32] As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539, it was retaken by the Byzantines.[33] In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region.[34] The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582.[35] Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle *De Administrando Imperio* mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the *strategos* for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610–641).[36] In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.[37][38]\nThe first record of the name *Belograd* appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive[39] to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: *Alba Bulgarica* in Latin, *Griechisch Weissenburg* in High German, *Nándorfehérvár* in Hungarian, and *Castelbianco* in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire.[40] Basil II (976–1025) installed a garrison in Belgrade.[41] The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade,[42] but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Siege of Belgrade (1688), Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria captured the city of Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire.\n![](image)Prince Eugene of Savoy at the Battle of Belgrade 1717. Artist: Johann Gottfried Auerbach. The battle was Eugene's last great victory.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276–1282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: *Dragutin István*) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.[44]\n\n\nFollowing the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.[45][46]\n\n\nThe northern regions of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarević, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.[44]\n\n\nIn 1427, Stefan's successor Đurađ Branković, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as Nándorfehérvár in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440[42] and 1456.[47] As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers[48] besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it.[49] The *noon bell* ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.[42][50]\n\n\n\n### Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Ottoman Serbia and Ottoman–Habsburg wars\n\n![](image)Belgrade in 1684\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent with 250,000 Turkish soldiers and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul[42][51] to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest.[52] Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople.[48] Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected—now by Oriental influences.[53] In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. In retribution, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vračar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.[54]\n\n\nOccupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688–1690, 1717–1739, 1789–1791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy,[55] and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time.[53] During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.[56]\n\n\n\n### Principality and Kingdom of Serbia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Principality of Serbia and Kingdom of Serbia\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture—such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1738 engraving of the palace of Duke of Württemberg, Austrian governor of Serbia\nDuring the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans.[58] After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.[59]\n\n\nThe development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: *Saborna crkva)*, completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.[60]\n\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenović moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade.[61][62] During his first reign (1815–1839), Prince Miloš Obrenović pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abadžijska čaršija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja čaršija and Gornja čaršija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (*mahalas*). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pašina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pašina, Bajram-begova, and Laz Hadži-Mahmudova.[63] Following the Čukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of Belgrade in 1890\nOn 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's *de facto* independence dates from this event.[65] In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimović had a significant influence on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimović's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul—the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia *de jure* still belonged—underwent similar changes.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Belgrade postcard from 1931[67] showing: Stari dvor, Terazije, Kneza Miloša Street, Kalemegdan and Old Post Office\nIn May 1868, *knez* Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinović while riding in a carriage in his country residence.[68]\n\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly.[58][69] Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Niš, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants[70] (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.[71]\n\n\nThe first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by André Carr, a representative of the Lumière brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved.[72] The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.[73]\n\n\n\n### World War I: German–Austrian invasion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Belgrade during the First World War, just before the Austro-Hungarian invasion of the Kingdom of Serbia 1914.\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Espèrey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, devastated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.[74]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The complex of the City Palaces Stari Dvor and Novi Dvor, and the semicircular Marshal's Palace of the Royal Palace (demolished in 1957).\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pančevo, formed a separate administrative unit.[75]\n\n\nDuring this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.[76]\n\n\nIn 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pančevo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935,[77] while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators.[78] The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.[79]\n\n\n\n### World War II: German invasion[edit]\n\n\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people.[80][81][82] Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate.\n\n![](image)Ruins in Belgrade after German bombing of 1941.\n[83] Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedić regime, headed by its namesake general.[84] Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime carried out the Genocide of Serbs.[85]\n\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz Böhme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot.[86] Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be *judenfrei*.[87] The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.[88]\n\n\nJust like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter.[89] Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans.\n\n\nOn 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963).[90]\n\n\n\n### Socialist Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The First Non-Aligned Movement Summit Conference took place in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in September 1961\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units.[91] During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre.[69]\n\n\nIn 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, Belgrade hosted the first and founding conference of the Non-Aligned Movement under Tito's chairmanship.[92] In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.[93]\n\n\nIn 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II.[94] Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference.[95] Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from all over the world, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.[96]\n\n\n\n### Breakup of Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former Ministry of Defence building damaged in the 1999 NATO bombing\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Drašković were held in the city against Slobodan Milošević.[97] According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets.[98] Two people were killed, 203 were injured and 108 were arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order.[99] Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, with the largest protests being dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo.[100][101] Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections.[102] These protests brought Zoran Đinđić to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.[103]\n\n\nIn 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused severe damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy.[104] Approximately 2,000 civilians were killed as a result of the NATO bombings.[105] After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, with more than a third of these refugees having settled in Belgrade.[106][107][108][109]\nAfter the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people taking part. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milošević as a part of the Otpor movement.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Belgrade Waterfront\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Around €3.5 billion was to be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners.[112][*needs update*] The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial—there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.[113]\n\n\nIn addition to Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where (as of 2020) apartment and office buildings were under construction to support the burgeoning Belgrade IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players. In September 2020, there were around 2000 active construction sites in Belgrade.[114]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade. Pictured from Kalemegdan Fortress.\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 m (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers.[14] The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnjača, Kotež and Borča, also merged with the city, while Pančevo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains separate. The city has an urban area of 360 km2 (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).[11]\n\n\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Belgrade city center seen from the Sava river\nOne of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. The most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Višnjica, Vinča and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Voždovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija.\n\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.[116][117]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Belgrade has a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) bordering on a humid continental climate (*Dfa*) with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 °C (34.5 °F) in January to 23.0 °C (73.4 °F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 °C (54.5 °F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 °C (86 °F), and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 °C (77 °F). Belgrade receives about 691 mm (27 in) of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.\n\n\nThe highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was 43.6 °C (110.5 °F) on 24 July 2007,[118] while on the other end, the lowest temperature was −26.2 °C (−15 °F) on 10 January 1893.[119]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Belgrade (1991–2020, extremes 1936–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 32.4(90.3)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 43.6(110.5)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 41.8(107.2)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 43.6(110.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 29.3(84.7)\n | 29.7(85.5)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | 0.5(32.9)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −24.5(−12.1)\n | −20.5(−4.9)\n | −12.4(9.7)\n | −3.4(25.9)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 4.6(40.3)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −8.3(17.1)\n | −15.8(3.6)\n | −24.5(−12.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 47.9(1.89)\n | 43.5(1.71)\n | 48.7(1.92)\n | 51.5(2.03)\n | 72.3(2.85)\n | 95.6(3.76)\n | 66.5(2.62)\n | 55.1(2.17)\n | 58.6(2.31)\n | 54.8(2.16)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 54.8(2.16)\n | 698.9(27.52)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 13.5\n | 12.3\n | 11.3\n | 12.4\n | 13.5\n | 12.2\n | 10.0\n | 8.4\n | 9.5\n | 10.5\n | 10.8\n | 13.8\n | 138.2\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 9.7\n | 7.3\n | 4.2\n | 0.7\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 3.0\n | 7.8\n | 32.8\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 77.9\n | 71.4\n | 62.7\n | 59.9\n | 61.9\n | 62.5\n | 59.8\n | 59.5\n | 65.8\n | 71.4\n | 75.1\n | 79.5\n | 67.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 70.7\n | 96.2\n | 146.7\n | 186.7\n | 224.7\n | 253.9\n | 278.8\n | 262.6\n | 192.6\n | 155.0\n | 92.1\n | 60.3\n | 2,020.3\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 8\n | 8\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: Republic Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia[120] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[121] Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[122] |\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Belgrade\n\n![](image)\nOn the picture: (left) Stari Dvor seat of the City Assembly of Belgrade, (center) House of the National Assembly, (right) Novi Dvor seat of the President of Serbia.\n\nBelgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority.[15] The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palace of Serbia and West 65 Tower, seen from Kalemegdan Fortress\nA 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration,[124] which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.[125]\n\n\nThe 2022 Belgrade City Assembly election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia. Between 2004 and 2013, the Democratic Party was in power.[126] Due to the importance of Belgrade in political and economic life of Serbia, the office of city's mayor is often described as the third most important office in the state, after the President of the Government and the President of the Republic.[127][128][129]\n\n\nAs the capital city, Belgrade is seat of all Serbian state authorities – executive, legislative, judiciary, and the headquarters of almost all national political parties as well as 75 diplomatic missions.[130] This includes the National Assembly, the Presidency, the Government of Serbia and all the ministries, Supreme Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court.\n\n\n\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Subdivisions of Belgrade\n\n![](image)Monument to the Unknown Hero on the mountain Avala, Avala Tower and city of Belgrade in distance.\nThe city is divided into 17 municipalities.[131] Previously, they were classified into 10 urban (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 suburban municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns.[132] With the new 2010 City statute, they were all given equal status, with the proviso that suburban ones (except Surčin) have certain autonomous powers, chiefly related with construction, infrastructure and public utilities.[131]\n\n\nMost of the municipalities are situated on the southern side of the Danube and Sava rivers, in the Šumadija region. Three municipalities (Zemun, Novi Beograd, and Surčin), are on the northern bank of the Sava in the Syrmia region and the municipality of Palilula, spanning the Danube, is in both the Šumadija and Banat regions.\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Belgrade map\n\n\n| Municipality\n | Classification\n | Area (km2)\n | Population (2021)\n | Population density (per km2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Barajevo | suburban | 213 | 26,604 | 125\n |\n| Čukarica | urban | 156 | 176,092 | 1,129\n |\n| Grocka | suburban | 289 | 83,435 | 289\n |\n| Lazarevac | suburban | 384 | 55,513 | 145\n |\n| Mladenovac | suburban | 339 | 49,020 | 145\n |\n| Novi Beograd | urban | 41 | 209,812 | 5,117\n |\n| Obrenovac | suburban | 411 | 69,376 | 169\n |\n| Palilula | urban | 451 | 182,672 | 405\n |\n| Rakovica | urban | 31 | 104,921 | 3,385\n |\n| Savski Venac | urban | 14 | 36,431 | 2,602\n |\n| Sopot | suburban | 271 | 19,246 | 71\n |\n| Stari Grad | urban | 5 | 44,712 | 8,942\n |\n| Surčin | urban | 285 | 45,595 | 160\n |\n| Voždovac | urban | 148 | 175,075 | 1,182\n |\n| Vračar | urban | 3 | 55,768 | 18,589\n |\n| Zemun | urban | 154 | 179,368 | 1,164\n |\n| Zvezdara | urban | 32 | 171,923 | 5,372\n |\n| Total |  | 3,227 | 1,685,563 | 522\n |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Belgrade and Demographic history of Belgrade\n\n![](image)Ada Bridge, 2022\n![](image)Belgrade oblast population pyramid in 2021\nAccording to the 2022 census, the statistical city proper has a population of 1,197,714, the urban area (with adjacent urban settlements like Borča, Ovča, Surčin, etc.) has 1,383,875 inhabitants, while the population of the administrative area of the City of Belgrade (often equated with Belgrade's metropolitan area) stands at 1,681,405 people. However, Belgrade's metropolitan area has not been defined, either statistically or administratively, and it sprawls into the neighboring municipalities like Pančevo, Opovo, Pećinci or Stara Pazova.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ascension Day the Patron Saint-day (slava) of the capital is traditionally celebrated the fortieth day of Easter and always on Thursday and Belgrade chose this day as its Day in memory of 1403 year, when the Despot Stefan Lazarević proclaimed Belgrade the capital of Serbia\nBelgrade is home to many ethnicities from across the former Yugoslavia and the wider Balkans region. The main ethnic group comprising over 86% of the metropolitan population of Belgrade are Serbs (1,449,241). Some significant minorities include Roma (23,160), Yugoslavs (10,499), Gorani (5,249), Montenegrins (5,134), Russians (4,659), Croats (4,554), Macedonians (4,293), and ethnic Muslims (2,718).[133] Many people came to the city as economic migrants from smaller towns and the countryside, while tens of thousands arrived as refugees from Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, as a result of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.[134] The most recent wave of immigration following the Russian invasion of Ukraine saw tens of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians register their residence in Serbia, majority of them in Belgrade.[135]\n\n\nBetween 10,000 and 20,000[136] Chinese people are estimated to live in Belgrade and, since their arrival in the mid-1990s, Block 70 in New Belgrade has been known colloquially as the Chinese quarter.[137][138] Many Middle Easterners, mainly from Syria, Iran, Jordan and Iraq, arrived in order to pursue their studies during the 1970s and 1980s, and have remained in the city.[139] Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, small communities of Aromanians, Czechs, Greeks, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Turks, Armenians and Russian White émigrés also existed in Belgrade. There are two suburban settlements with significant minority population today: Ovča and the village of Boljevci, both with about one quarter of their population being Romanians and Slovaks, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1426 | 50,000[140] | —     |\n| 1683 | 100,000[140] | +0.27% |\n| 1800 | 25,000[141] | −1.18% |\n| 1850 | 15,000[141] | −1.02% |\n| 1860 | 22,000[141] | +3.90% |\n| 1875 | 27,000[141] | +1.37% |\n| 1880 | 36,000[141] | +5.92% |\n| 1890 | 54,000[141] | +4.14% |\n| 1900 | 69,000[141] | +2.48% |\n| 1910 | 89,000[141] | +2.58% |\n| 1921 | 111,739 | +2.09% |\n| 1931 | 238,775 | +7.89% |\n| 1948 | 397,911 | +3.05% |\n| 1953 | 477,982 | +3.73% |\n| 1961 | 657,362 | +4.06% |\n| 1971 | 899,094 | +3.18% |\n| 1981 | 1,087,915 | +1.92% |\n| 1991 | 1,133,146 | +0.41% |\n| 2002 | 1,119,642 | −0.11% |\n| 2011 | 1,166,763 | +0.46% |\n| 2022 | 1,197,714 | +0.24% |\n\n\n\n\n| Settlements\n | Population[142] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Belgrade | 1,197,714\n |\n| Borča | 51,862\n |\n| Kaluđerica | 28,483\n |\n| Lazarevac | 27,635\n |\n| Obrenovac | 25,380\n |\n| Mladenovac | 22,346\n |\n| Surčin | 20,602\n |\n| Sremčica | 19,434\n |\n| Ugrinovci | 11,859\n |\n| Leštane | 10,454\n |\n| Ripanj | 10,084\n |\n\n\nAlthough there are several historic religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup of the city is relatively homogeneous. The Serbian Orthodox community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 Protestants.\n\n\nThere once was a significant Jewish community in Belgrade but, following the World War II Nazi occupation of the city and subsequent Jewish emigration, their numbers have fallen from over 10,000 to just 295.[143] Belgrade also used to have one of the largest Buddhist colonies in Europe outside Russia when some 400 mostly Buddhist Kalmyks settled on the outskirts of Belgrade following the Russian Civil War. The first Buddhist temple in Europe was built in Belgrade in 1929. Most of them moved away after the World War II and their temple, Belgrade pagoda, was abandoned, claimed by the new Communist regime and eventually demolished.[144]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Belgrade\n See also: Belgrade IT sector and Architectural projects in Belgrade\n\n![](image)Serbian Railways headquarters in Belgrade\nBelgrade is the financial centre of Serbia and Southeast Europe, with a total of 17×10~~^~~6 m2 (180×10~~^~~6 sq ft) of office space.[145] It is also home to the country's Central Bank. 750,550 people are employed (July 2020)[146] in 120,286 companies,[147] 76,307 enterprises and 50,000 shops.[146][148] The City of Belgrade itself owns 267,147 m2 (2,875,550 sq ft) of rentable office space.[149]\nAs of 2019, Belgrade contained 31.4% of Serbia's employed population and generated over 40.4% of its GDP.[150][151]  [152] City GDP in 2023 at purchasing power parity is estimated at $73 bn USD, which is $43,400 per capita in terms of purchasing power parity. Nominal GDP in 2023 is estimated at $ 31.5 bn USD, which is $ 18.700 per capita.[153]\n\n\nNew Belgrade is the country's Central business district and one of Southeastern Europe's financial centres.

Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.[206]\n\n\n\n![](image)House of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia\n![](image)Kalemegdan\n![](image)Galeria Belgrade, the largest shopping center in the region\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish türbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorćol, from late 18th century.[207] Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau.[206] Elements of Serbo-Byzantine Revival are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gračanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.[206]\n\n\nIn the socialist period, housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the *blokovi* ('blocks') of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall.[206] However, in the mid-1950s, modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.[206]\nBelgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe.[208] The Clinical Centre of Serbia spreads over 34 hectares and consists of about 50 buildings, while also has 3,150 beds considered to be the highest number in Europe,[209] and among highest in the world.[210]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tourism in Serbia\n\nLying on the main artery connecting Europe and Asia, as well as, eventually, the Orient Express, Belgrade has been a popular place for travellers through the centuries. \nIn 1843, on Dubrovačka Street (today Kralj Petar Street ), Serbia's *knez* Mihailo Obrenović built a large edifice which became the first hotel in Belgrade: *Kod jelena* ('at the deer's'), in the neighbourhood of Kosančićev Venac. Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the *staro zdanje*, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938.[211][212] After the *staro zdanje*, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: *Nacional* and *Grand*, also in Kosančićev Venac, *Srpski Kralj*, *Srpska Kruna*, *Grčka Kraljica* near Kalemegdan, *Balkan* and *Pariz* in Terazije, *London*, etc.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jevremovac Botanical Garden\n![](image)Gardoš Tower, Zemun, during the winter\nAs Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities.

At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s.[267] Following renewed growth in 2000, the number of passengers reached approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005,[268] over 2.6 million passengers in 2008,[269] reaching over 3 million passengers.[270] A record with over 4 million passengers was broken in 2014, when Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport became the second fastest growing major airport in Europe.[271] The numbers continued to grow steadily and the all-time peak of over 6 million passengers was reached in 2019.[272]\n\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Serbia\n\n![](image)Because of the heroic strength of its defenders, French marshal Louis Franchet d'Espèrey decorated Belgrade with the Legion of Honor in 1920.\nList of Belgrade's sister and twin cities:[273]\n\n\n\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Coventry, UK, since 1957[274][275]\n* ![United States](image) Chicago, US, since 2005\n* ![Slovenia](image) Ljubljana, Slovenia, since 2010[276][277]\n* ![North Macedonia](image) Skopje, North Macedonia, since 2012[278][279]\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China, since 2018[280]\n* ![Bosnia and Herzegovina](image) Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 2020[281]\n\n\n### Partner cities[edit]\n\n\nOther friendships and cooperations, protocols, memorandums:[273]\n\n\n\n* ![Bosnia and Herzegovina](image) Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 2018, Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation\n* ![Morocco](image) Rabat, Morocco, since 2017, Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea, since 2017, Memorandum of Understanding on Friendly Exchanges and Cooperation\n* ![Kazakhstan](image) Astana, Kazakhstan, since 2016, Agreement on Cooperation[282]\n* ![Iran](image) Tehran, Iran, since 2016, Agreement on Cooperation[283]\n* ![Greece](image) Corfu, Greece, since 2010, Protocol on Cooperation\n* ![China](image) Shenzhen, China, since 2009, Agreement on Cooperation[284]\n* ![Croatia](image) Zagreb, Croatia, since 2003, Letter of Intent\n* ![Ukraine](image) Kyiv, Ukraine, since 2002, Agreement on Cooperation\n* ![Algeria](image) Algiers, Algeria, since 1991 declaration of mutual interests\n* ![Israel](image) Tel Aviv, Israel, since 1990, Agreement on Cooperation\n* ![Romania](image) Bucharest, Romania, since 1999, Agreement on Cooperation\n* ![China](image) Beijing, China, since 1980, Agreement on Cooperation[285]\n* ![Italy](image) Rome, Italy, since 1971, Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation\n* ![Greece](image) Athens, Greece, since 1966, Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation\n\nSome of the city's municipalities are also twinned to small cities or districts of other big cities; for details see their respective articles.\n\n\nBelgrade has received various domestic and international honours, including the French Légion d'honneur (proclaimed 21 December 1920; Belgrade is one of four cities outside France, alongside Liège, Luxembourg and Volgograd, to receive this honour), the Czechoslovak War Cross (awarded 8 October 1925), the Yugoslavian Order of the Karađorđe's Star (awarded 18 May 1939) and the Yugoslavian Order of the People's Hero (proclaimed on 20 October 1974, the 30th anniversary of the overthrow of Nazi German occupation during World War II).[286] All of these decorations were received for the war efforts during World War I and World War II.[287] In 2006, *Financial Times'* magazine *Foreign Direct Investment* awarded Belgrade the title of *City of the Future of Southern Europe*.[288][289]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of people from Belgrade\n* List of cities and towns on Danube river\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *Ethnicity - data by municipalities and cities* (PDF).

It shares land borders with Hungary to the north, Romania to the northeast, Bulgaria to the southeast, North Macedonia to the south, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west, and Montenegro to the southwest. Serbia claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia has about 6.6 million inhabitants, excluding Kosovo. Its capital Belgrade is also the largest city.\n\n\nContinuously inhabited since the Paleolithic Age, the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations in the 6th century, establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine, Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms. The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217, reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the Serbian Empire. By the mid-16th century, the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire, which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina. In the early 19th century, the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region's first constitutional monarchy, which subsequently expanded its territory.[10] In 1918, in the aftermath of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia united with the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina; later in the same year it joined with other South Slavic nations in the foundation of Yugoslavia, which existed in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia formed a union with Montenegro,[11] which was peacefully dissolved in 2006, restoring Serbia's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since 1918.[12] In 2008, representatives of the Assembly of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence, with mixed responses from the international community while Serbia continues to claim it as part of its own sovereign territory.\n\n\nSerbia is an upper-middle income economy, ranked \"very high\" in the Human Development Index domain. It is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic, member of the UN, CoE, OSCE, PfP, BSEC, CEFTA, and is acceding to the WTO. Since 2014, the country has been negotiating its EU accession, with the possibility of joining the European Union by 2030.[13] Serbia formally adheres to the policy of military neutrality. The country provides universal health care and free primary and secondary education to its citizens.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Names of the Serbs and Serbia and Origin hypotheses of the Serbs\n\nThe origin of the name *Serbia* is unclear. Historically, authors have mentioned the Serbs (Serbian: Srbi / Срби) and the Sorbs of Eastern Germany (Upper Sorbian: *Serbja*; Lower Sorbian: *Serby*) in a variety of ways: *Cervetiis* (*Servetiis*), *gentis (S)urbiorum*, *Suurbi*, *Sorabi*, *Soraborum*, *Sorabos*, *Surpe*, *Sorabici*, *Sorabiet*, *Sarbin*, *Swrbjn*, *Servians*, *Sorbi*, *Sirbia, Sribia, Zirbia, Zribia*, *Suurbelant*, *Surbia*, *Serbulia* / *Sorbulia* among others.[14][15][16] These authors used these names to refer to Serbs and Sorbs in areas where their historical and current presence is not disputable (notably in the Balkans and Lusatia). However, there are also sources that mention the same or similar names in other parts of the World (most notably in the Asiatic Sarmatia in the Caucasus).\n\n\nThere exist two prevailing theories on the origin of the ethnonym *\\*Sŕbъ* (plur. *\\*Sŕby*), one from a Proto-Slavic language with an appellative meaning of a \"family kinship\" and \"alliance\", while another from an Iranian-Sarmatian language with various meanings.[15][17] In his work, *De Administrando Imperio*, Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus suggests that the Serbs originated from White Serbia near Francia. According to the recorded tradition the White Serbs split in two, with the half that became known as the Serbs coming down to settle Byzantine land.\n\n\nFrom 1815 to 1882, the official name for Serbia was the Principality of Serbia. From 1882 to 1918, it was renamed to the Kingdom of Serbia, later from 1945 to 1963, the official name for Serbia was the People's Republic of Serbia. This was again renamed the Socialist Republic of Serbia from 1963 to 1990. Since 1990, the official name of the country has been the Republic of Serbia.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Serbia\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Serbian history\n\n### Prehistory and antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Prehistoric sites in Serbia and Serbia in the Roman era\n\n![](image)\nLepenski Vir idol, 7000 BC\n![](image)\nVinča culture figurine, 4000–4500 BC\n\nArchaeological evidence of Paleolithic settlements on the territory of present-day Serbia is scarce. A fragment of a human jaw was found in Sićevo (Mala Balanica) and is believed to be up to 525,000–397,000 years old.[18]\n\n\nApproximately around 6,500 years BC, during the Neolithic, the Starčevo and Vinča cultures existed in the region of modern-day Belgrade. They dominated much of Southeast Europe (as well as parts of Central Europe and Anatolia). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including Lepenski Vir and Vinča-Belo Brdo, still exist near the banks of the Danube.[19][20]\n\n\nDuring the Iron Age, local tribes of Triballi, Dardani, and Autariatae were encountered by the Ancient Greeks during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of Scordisci settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day Niš).\n\n\nThe Romans conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC, the Roman province of Illyricum was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of Moesia Superior; the modern-day Srem region was conquered in 9 BC; and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the Dacian Wars. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including Moesia, Pannonia, Praevalitana, Dalmatia, Dacia, and Macedonia.\n\n\nThe chief towns of Upper Moesia (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), Viminacium (now Old Kostolac), Remesiana (now Bela Palanka), Naissos (Niš), and Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the Tetrarchy.[21] Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.[22] The most famous of these was Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering religious tolerance throughout the Empire.\n\n\n\n![](image)Remnants of the Felix Romuliana Imperial Palace, 298 AD, a UNESCO World Heritage Site; as many as 18 Roman emperors were born in modern-day Serbia[23][24]\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the Byzantine Empire. At the same time, its northwestern parts were included in the Western Roman Empire. By the 6th century, South Slavs migrated into the European provinces of the Byzantine Empire in large numbers.[25] They merged with the local Romanised population that was gradually assimilated.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sorbs (tribe) and Serbia in the Middle Ages\n\nWhite Serbs, an early Slavic tribe from White Serbia eventually settled in an area between the Sava river and the Dinaric Alps.[29][30][31] By the beginning of the 9th century, Serbia achieved a level of statehood.[32] Christianization of Serbia was a gradual process, finalized by the middle of the 9th century.[33] In the mid-10th-century, the Serbian state stretched between the Adriatic Sea, the Neretva, the Sava, the Morava, and Skadar. During the 11th and 12th century, Serbian state frequently fought with the neighbouring Byzantine Empire.[34] Between 1166 and 1371, Serbia was ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to a kingdom in 1217,[35] and an empire in 1346,[36] under Stefan Dušan. Serbian Orthodox Church was organized as an autocephalous archbishopric in 1219,[37] through the effort of Sava, the country's patron saint, and in 1346 it was raised to the Patriarchate. Monuments of the Nemanjić period survive in many monasteries (several being World Heritage sites) and fortifications.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Coronation of the Serbian Tsar, Stefan Dušan known as Dušan the Mighty in Skopje, as Emperor of Serbs and Greeks in 1346.\nDuring these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part (modern Vojvodina), was ruled by the Kingdom of Hungary. The period after 1371, known as the Fall of the Serbian Empire saw the once-powerful state fragmented into several principalities, culminating in the Battle of Kosovo (1389) against the rising Ottoman Empire.[38] By the end of the 14th century, the Turks had conquered and ruled the territories south of the Šar Mountains. At the same time, the political center of Serbia shifted northwards, when the capital of the newly established Serbian Despotate was transferred to Belgrade in 1403,[39] before moving to Smederevo in 1430.[40] The Despotate was then under the double vassalage of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.[41] The fall of Smederevo on June 20, 1459, which marked the full conquest of the Serbian Despotate by the Ottomans, also symbolically signified the end of the Serbian state.[42]\n\n\n\n### Ottoman and Habsburg rule[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ottoman Serbia and Great Migrations of the Serbs\n\n![](image)The Battle of Kosovo (1389) is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition and national identity.[43]\nIn all Serbian lands conquered by the Ottomans, the native nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman rulers, while much of the clergy fled or were confined to the isolated monasteries. Under the Ottoman system, Serbs, as well as Christians, were considered an inferior class of people and subjected to heavy taxes, and a portion of the Serbian population experienced Islamization. Many Serbs were recruited during the devshirme system, a form of slavery in the Ottoman Empire, in which boys from Balkan Christian families were forcibly converted to Islam and trained for infantry units of the Ottoman army known as the Janissaries.[44][45][46][47] The Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was extinguished in 1463,[48] but reestablished in 1557,[49][50][51] providing for limited continuation of Serbian cultural traditions within the Ottoman Empire, under the Millet system.[52][53]\n\n\nAfter the loss of statehood to the Ottoman Empire, Serbian resistance continued in northern regions (modern Vojvodina), under titular despots (until 1537), and popular leaders like Jovan Nenad (1526–1527). From 1521 to 1552, Ottomans conquered Belgrade and regions of Syrmia, Bačka, and Banat.[54] Continuing wars and various rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule. One of the most significant was the Banat Uprising in 1594 and 1595, which was part of the Long War (1593–1606) between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.[55][56] The area of modern Vojvodina endured a century-long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the Habsburg monarchy, partially by the Treaty of Karlovci (1699),[57] and fully by the Treaty of Požarevac (1718).[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Migration of the Serbs*, by Paja Jovanović (c. 1896), depicting the Great Migration of 1690, led by the patriarch Arsenije III Crnojević\nDuring the Habsburg-Ottoman war (1683–1699), much of Serbia switched from Ottoman rule to Habsburg control from 1688 to 1690, including the cities of Belgrade, Čačak, Užice and Niš, as well as the area of present-day Kosovo.[59] However, the Ottoman army reconquered a large part of Serbia in the winter of 1689/1690, leading to a brutal massacre of the civilian population by uncontrolled Albanian and Tatar units. As a result of the persecutions, several tens of thousands of Serbs, led by the patriarch, Arsenije III Crnojević, fled northwards across the Sava river, to settle in Hungary,[60] an event known as the Great Migration of 1690.[61] In August 1690, following several petitions, the Emperor Leopold I formally granted Serbs from the Habsburg monarchy a first set of “privileges”,[62][63] primarily to guarantee them freedom of religion.[64] As a consequence, the ecclesiastical centre of the Serbs also moved northwards, to the Metropolitanate of Karlovci,[65] and the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was once-again abolished by the Ottomans in 1766.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1718–39, the Habsburg monarchy occupied much of Central Serbia and established the Kingdom of Serbia as crownland.[58] Those gains were lost by the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, when the Ottomans retook the region.[68] Apart from territory of modern Vojvodina which remained under the Habsburg Empire, central regions of Serbia were occupied once again by the Habsburgs in 1788–1792.\n\n\n\n### Revolution and independence[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Serbian Revolution, Principality of Serbia, and Kingdom of Serbia\n\nThe Serbian Revolution for independence from the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815.[69][70][71][72] The revolution comprised two separate uprisings which gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire (1830) that eventually evolved towards full independence (1878). During the First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813), led by vožd Karađorđe Petrović, Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country.[73] Shortly after this, the Second Serbian Uprising began in 1815. Led by Miloš Obrenović, it ended with a compromise between Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities.[74] Likewise, Serbia was one of the first nations in the Balkans to abolish feudalism.[75] The Akkerman Convention in 1826, the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829 and finally, the Hatt-i Sharif, recognised the suzerainty of Serbia. The First Serbian Constitution was adopted on 15 February 1835 (the anniversary of the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising), making the country one of the first to adopt a democratic constitution in Europe.[76][77] 15 February is now commemorated as Statehood Day, a public holiday.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKarađorđe Petrović and Miloš Obrenović, leaders of the Serbian Revolution\n\nFollowing the clashes between the Ottoman army and Serbs in Belgrade in 1862,[79] and under pressure from the Great Powers, by 1867 the last Turkish soldiers left the Principality, making the country *de facto* independent.[80] By enacting a new constitution in 1869,[81] without consulting the Porte, Serbian diplomats confirmed the *de facto* independence of the country. In 1876, Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, siding with the ongoing Christian uprisings in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bulgaria.[82][83]\n\n\nThe formal independence of the country was internationally recognised at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, which ended the Russo-Turkish War; this treaty, however, prohibited Serbia from uniting with other Serbian regions by placing Bosnia and Herzegovina under Austro-Hungarian occupation, alongside the occupation of the region of Raška.[84] From 1815 to 1903, the Principality of Serbia was ruled by the House of Obrenović, save for the rule of Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević between 1842 and 1858. In 1882, Principality of Serbia became the Kingdom of Serbia, ruled by King Milan I.[85] The House of Karađorđević, descendants of the revolutionary leader Karađorđe Petrović, assumed power in 1903 following the May Overthrow.[86]\nIn the north, the 1848 revolution in Austria led to the establishment of the autonomous territory of Serbian Vojvodina; by 1849, the region was transformed into the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.[87]\n\n\n\n### The Balkan Wars and World War I[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Balkan Wars and Serbian Campaign of World War I\n\nIn the course of the First Balkan War in 1912, the Balkan League defeated the Ottoman Empire and captured its European territories, which enabled territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Serbia into regions of Raška, Kosovo, Metohija, and Vardarian Macedonia. The Second Balkan War soon ensued when Bulgaria turned on its former allies, but was defeated, resulting in the Treaty of Bucharest. In two years, Serbia enlarged its territory by 80% and its population by 50%,[88] it also suffered high casualties on the eve of World War I, with more than 36,000 dead.[89] Austria-Hungary became wary of the rising regional power on its borders and its potential to become an anchor for unification of Serbs and other South Slavs, and the relationship between the two countries became tense.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Great Serbian Retreat in 1915* led by Peter I of Serbia. As the part of Entente Powers during WW I, Serbia lost about 850,000 people, a quarter of its pre-war population.[90]\nThe assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Young Bosnia organisation, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, on 28 July 1914.[91] Local war escalated when Germany declared war on Russia and invaded France and Belgium, thus drawing Great Britain into the conflict that became the First World War. Serbia won the first major battles of World War I, including the Battle of Cer,[92] and the Battle of Kolubara, marking the first Allied victories against the Central Powers in World War I.[93]\n\n\nDespite initial success, it was eventually overpowered by the Central Powers in 1915 and Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia followed. Most of its army and some people retreated through Albania to Greece and Corfu, suffering immense losses on the way. Serbia was occupied by the Central Powers. After the Central Powers military situation on other fronts worsened, the remains of the Serb army returned east and led a final breakthrough through enemy lines on 15 September 1918, liberating Serbia and defeating Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary.[94] Serbia, with its campaign, was a major Balkan Entente Power[95] which contributed significantly to the Allied victory in the Balkans in November 1918, especially by helping France force Bulgaria's capitulation.[96]\n\n\nSerbia's casualties accounted for 8% of the total Entente military deaths; 58% (243,600) soldiers of the Serbian army perished in the war.[97] The total number of casualties is placed around 700,000,[98] more than 16% of Serbia's prewar size,[99] and a majority (57%) of its overall male population.[100][101][102] Serbia suffered the biggest casualty rate in World War I.[103]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Creation of Yugoslavia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia\n\nThe beginnings of the idea of the first common South Slavic state were the signing of a declaration on the island of Corfu in 1917.[104] The Corfu Declaration was a formal agreement between the government-in-exile of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Yugoslav Committee (anti-Habsburg South Slav émigrés) that pledged to unify Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Montenegro with Austria-Hungary's South Slav autonomous crown lands: Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Kingdom of Dalmatia, Slovenia, Vojvodina (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) and Bosnia and Herzegovina in a post-war Yugoslav state. It was signed on 20 July 1917 on Corfu.\n\n\n\n![](image)On November 25, 1918 in Novi Sad, the Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja, the Serbian Crown Lands in the Austria-Hungary, (today's Vojvodina) declared unification with the Kingdom of Serbia\nAs the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, the territory of Syrmia united with Serbia on 24 November 1918.[88] Just a day later, on 25 November 1918, the Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja declared the unification of these regions (Banat, Bačka, and Baranja) with the Kingdom of Serbia.[105]\n\n\nOn 26 November 1918, the Podgorica Assembly deposed the House of Petrović-Njegoš and united Montenegro with Serbia.[106] On 1 December 1918, in Belgrade, Serbian Prince Regent Alexander Karađorđević proclaimed the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, under King Peter I of Serbia.[107][108]\n\n\nKing Peter was succeeded by his son, Alexander, in August 1921. Serb centralists and Croat autonomists clashed in the parliament, and most governments were fragile and short-lived. Nikola Pašić, a conservative prime minister, headed or dominated most governments until his death. King Alexander established a dictatorship in 1929 with the aim of establishing the Yugoslav ideology and single Yugoslav nation, changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia and changed the internal divisions from the 33 oblasts to nine new banovinas. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs living in Yugoslavia from the idea of unity.[109]\n\n\nAlexander was assassinated in Marseille, during an official visit in 1934 by Vlado Chernozemski, member of the IMRO. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son Peter II and a regency council was headed by his cousin, Prince Paul. In August 1939 the Cvetković–Maček Agreement established an autonomous Banate of Croatia as a solution to Croatian concerns.\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: World War II in Yugoslavia, The Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia, and Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia\n\nIn 1941, in spite of Yugoslav attempts to remain neutral in the war, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia. The territory of modern Serbia was divided between Hungary, Bulgaria, the Independent State of Croatia, Greater Albania and Montenegro, while the remaining part of the occupied Serbia was placed under the military administration of Nazi Germany, with Serbian puppet governments led by Milan Aćimović and Milan Nedić assisted by Dimitrije Ljotić's fascist organization Yugoslav National Movement (Zbor).\n\n\n\n![](image)A monument commemorating the victims of the Nazi German established Sajmište concentration camp, a part of the Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia and Genocide of Serbs.\nThe Yugoslav territory was the scene of a civil war between royalist Chetniks commanded by Draža Mihailović and communist partisans commanded by Josip Broz Tito. Axis auxiliary units of the Serbian Volunteer Corps and the Serbian State Guard fought against both of these forces. The siege of Kraljevo was a major battle of the uprising in Serbia, led by Chetnik forces against the Nazis. Several days after the battle began the German forces committed a massacre of approximately 2,000 civilians in an event known as the Kraljevo massacre, in a reprisal for the attack.\n\n\nDraginac and Loznica massacre of 2,950 villagers in Western Serbia in 1941 was the first large execution of civilians in occupied Serbia by Germans, with Kragujevac massacre and Novi Sad Raid of Jews and Serbs by Hungarian fascists being the most notorious, with over 3,000 victims in each case.[110][111] After one year of occupation, around 16,000 Serbian Jews were murdered in the area, or around 90% of its pre-war Jewish population during The Holocaust in Serbia.\nMany concentration camps were established across the area. Banjica concentration camp was the largest concentration camp and jointly run by the German army and Nedić's regime,[112] with primary victims being Serbian Jews, Roma, and Serb political prisoners.[113]\n\n\nDuring this period, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs fled the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia and sought refuge in German-occupied Serbia, seeking to escape the large-scale persecution and Genocide of Serbs, Jews, and Roma being committed by the Ustaše regime.[114] The number of Serb victims was approximately 300,000 to 350,000.[115][116][117]\n\n\nAccording to Tito himself, Serbs made up the vast majority of anti-fascist fighters and Yugoslav Partisans for the whole course of World War II.[118]\nThe Republic of Užice was a short-lived liberated territory established by the Partisans and the first liberated territory in World War II Europe, organised as a military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in the west of occupied Serbia. By late 1944, the Belgrade Offensive swung in favour of the partisans in the civil war; the partisans subsequently gained control of Yugoslavia.[119] Following the Belgrade Offensive, the Syrmian Front was the last major military action of World War II in Serbia. A study by Vladimir Žerjavić estimates total war related deaths in Yugoslavia at 1,027,000, including 273,000 in Serbia.[120]\n\n\n\n### Socialist Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45, Tito–Stalin split, and Non-Aligned Movement\n\nThe victory of the Communist Partisans resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and a subsequent constitutional referendum. A one-party state was soon established in Yugoslavia by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. \n\n![](image)The principle of non-alignment was the core of Yugoslav and later Serbian diplomacy. The First Non-Aligned Movement Summit Conference took place in Belgrade in September 1961\nIt is claimed between 60,000 and 70,000 people died in Serbia during the 1944–45 communist takeover and purge.[121] All opposition was suppressed and people deemed to be promoting opposition to socialism or promoting separatism were imprisoned or executed for sedition. Serbia became a constituent republic within the Federal People's Republic\nof Yugoslavia known as the People's Republic of Serbia, and had a republic-branch of the federal communist party, the League of Communists of Serbia.\n\n\nSerbia's most powerful and influential politician in Tito-era Yugoslavia was Aleksandar Ranković, one of the \"big four\" Yugoslav leaders, alongside Tito, Edvard Kardelj, and Milovan Đilas. Ranković was later removed from the office because of the disagreements regarding Kosovo's nomenklatura and the unity of Serbia. Ranković's dismissal was highly unpopular among Serbs. Pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a distinctive \"Muslim\" nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs on a large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs of being treated as second-class citizens.[122]\n\n\nBelgrade, the capital of FPR Yugoslavia and PR Serbia, hosted the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit in September 1961, as well as the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from October 1977 to March 1978.[123][124] The 1972 smallpox outbreak in SAP Kosovo and other parts of SR Serbia was the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II.[125]\n\n\n\n### Breakup of Yugoslavia and political transition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Slobodan Milošević was a prominent political figure in the former Yugoslavia. His leadership was controversial, with critics stating his government continued to be authoritarian despite constitutional changes.\nMain articles: Breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, Republic of Serbia (1992–2006), and History of Serbia § Independent Serbia (2006–present)\n\nIn 1989, Slobodan Milošević rose to power in Serbia. Milošević promised a reduction of powers for the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, where his allies subsequently took over power, during the Anti-bureaucratic revolution.[126] This ignited tensions between the communist leadership of the other republics of Yugoslavia and awoke ethnic nationalism across Yugoslavia that eventually resulted in its breakup, with Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia declaring independence during 1991 and 1992.[127][*better source needed*] Serbia and Montenegro remained together as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).[11] However, according to the Badinter Commission, the country was not legally considered a continuation of the former SFRY, but a new state.\n\n\nFueled by ethnic tensions, the Yugoslav Wars (1991–2001) erupted, with the most severe conflicts taking place in Croatia and Bosnia, where the large ethnic Serb communities opposed independence from Yugoslavia. The FRY remained outside the conflicts, but provided logistic, military and financial support to Serb forces in the wars. In response, the UN imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia which led to political isolation and the collapse of the economy (GDP decreased from $24 billion in 1990 to under $10 billion in 1993). Serbia was in the 2000s sued on the charges of alleged genocide by neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia but in both cases the main charges against Serbia were dismissed.[128][129]\n\n\nMulti-party democracy was introduced in Serbia in 1990, officially dismantling the one-party system. Critics of Milošević stated that the government continued to be authoritarian despite constitutional changes, as Milošević maintained strong political influence over the state media and security apparatus.[130][131] When the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia refused to accept its defeat in municipal elections in 1996, Serbians engaged in large protests against the government.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and territories of Serb breakaway states Republika Srpska and Republika Srpska Krajina during the Yugoslav wars\nIn 1998, continued clashes between the Albanian guerilla Kosovo Liberation Army and Yugoslav security forces led to the short Kosovo War (1998–99), in which NATO intervened, leading to the withdrawal of Serbian forces and the establishment of UN administration in the province.[132] After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe.[133][134][135]\n\n\nAfter presidential elections in September 2000, opposition parties accused Milošević of electoral fraud, with the government claiming that his main challenger, Vojislav Koštunica, did not gain the majority of votes needed to avoid a run-off against Milošević.[136][137] A campaign of civil resistance followed, led by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a broad coalition of anti-Milošević parties. This culminated on 5 October when half a million people from all over the country congregated in Belgrade, compelling Milošević to concede defeat.[138] The fall of Milošević ended Yugoslavia's international isolation. Milošević was sent to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The DOS announced that FR Yugoslavia would seek to join the European Union. In 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was renamed Serbia and Montenegro;[139] the EU opened negotiations with the country for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.\n\n\n\n![](image)Serbian and other children refugees of the Kosovo War. The war ended with NATO bombing which remains a controversial topic.\nSerbia's political climate remained tense and in 2003, the Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić was assassinated as result of a plot originating from circles of organised crime and former security officials. In 2004 unrest in Kosovo took place, leaving 19 people dead and a number of Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries destroyed or damaged.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Serbia § Republic of Serbia (2006–present)\n\nOn 21 May 2006, Montenegro held a referendum to determine whether to end its union with Serbia. The results showed 55.4% of voters in favour of independence, which was just above the 55% required by the referendum. This was followed on 5 June 2006 by Serbia's declaration of independence, marking the final dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and the re-emergence of Serbia as an independent state, for the first time since 1918. On the same occasion, the National Assembly of Serbia declared Serbia to be the legal successor to the former state union.[142]\n\n\nThe Assembly of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. Serbia immediately condemned the declaration and continues to deny any statehood to Kosovo. The declaration has sparked varied responses from the international community, some welcoming it, while others condemned the unilateral move.[143] Status-neutral talks between Serbia and Kosovo-Albanian authorities are held in Brussels, mediated by the EU.\n\n\nSerbia officially applied for membership in the European Union on 22 December 2009,[144] and received candidate status on 1 March 2012, following a delay in December 2011.[145][146] Following a positive recommendation of the European Commission and European Council in June 2013, negotiations to join the EU commenced in January 2014.[147]\n\n\nSince Aleksandar Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party came to power in 2012,[148][149] Serbia has suffered from democratic backsliding into authoritarianism,[150][151][152] followed by a decline in media freedom and civil liberties.[153][154] After the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, a state of emergency was declared and a curfew was introduced for the first time in Serbia since World War II.[155] In January and February 2021, Serbia carried the second-fastest vaccine rollout in Europe.[156][157][158] In April 2022, President Aleksandar Vučić was re-elected.[159]\nSerbia drew western criticism for not joining EU sanctions against Russia and maintaining bilateral relations after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, Serbia condemned Russia at the United Nations General Assembly and Human Rights Council.[160]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Serbia\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Serbia including Kosovo\nA landlocked country situated at the crossroads between Central[161][162] and Southeastern Europe, Serbia is located in the Balkan peninsula and the Pannonian Plain. Serbia lies between latitudes 41° and 47° N, and longitudes 18° and 23° E. The country covers a total of 88,499 km2 (34,170 sq mi) (including Kosovo), which places it at 113th place in the world; with Kosovo excluded, the total area is 77,474 km2 (29,913 sq mi),[3][163] which would make it 117th. Its total border length amounts to 2,027 km (1,260 mi): Albania 115 km (71 mi), Bosnia and Herzegovina 302 km (188 mi), Bulgaria 318 km (198 mi), Croatia 241 km (150 mi), Hungary 151 km (94 mi), North Macedonia 221 km (137 mi), Montenegro 203 km (126 mi) and Romania 476 km (296 mi).[3] All of Kosovo's border with Albania (115 km (71 mi)), North Macedonia (159 km (99 mi)) and Montenegro (79 km (49 mi))[164] are under control of the Kosovo border police.[165] Serbia treats the 352 km (219 mi) long border between Kosovo and rest of Serbia as an \"administrative line\"; it is under shared control of Kosovo border police and Serbian police forces, and there are 11 crossing points.[166]\nThe Pannonian Plain covers the northern third of the country (Vojvodina and Mačva[167]) while the easternmost tip of Serbia extends into the Wallachian Plain.\nThe terrain of the central part of the country, with the region of Šumadija at its heart, consists chiefly of hills traversed by rivers. Mountains dominate the southern third of Serbia. Dinaric Alps stretch in the west and the southwest, following the flow of the rivers Drina and Ibar. The Carpathian Mountains and Balkan Mountains stretch in a north–south direction in eastern Serbia.[168]\n\n\nAncient mountains in the southeast corner of the country belong to the Rilo-Rhodope Mountain system. Elevation ranges from the Midžor peak of the Balkan Mountains at 2,169 metres (7,116 feet) (the highest peak in Serbia, excluding Kosovo) to the lowest point of just 17 metres (56 feet) near the Danube river at Prahovo.[169] The largest lake is Đerdap Lake (163 square kilometres (63 sq mi)) and the longest river passing through Serbia is the Danube (587.35 kilometres (364.96 mi)).\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Serbia\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification map of Serbia including Kosovo.\nThe climate of Serbia is under the influences of the landmass of Eurasia and the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. With mean January temperatures around 0 °C (32 °F), and mean July temperatures of 22 °C (72 °F), it can be classified as a warm-humid continental or humid subtropical climate.[170] In the north, the climate is more continental, with cold winters, and hot, humid summers along with well-distributed rainfall patterns. In the south, summers and autumns are drier, and winters are relatively cold, with heavy inland snowfall in the mountains.\n\n\nDifferences in elevation, proximity to the Adriatic Sea and large river basins, as well as exposure to the winds account for climate variations.[171] Southern Serbia is subject to Mediterranean influences.[172] The Dinaric Alps and other mountain ranges contribute to the cooling of most of the warm air masses. Winters are quite harsh in the Pešter plateau, because of the mountains which encircle it.[173] One of the climatic features of Serbia is Košava, a cold and very squally southeastern wind which starts in the Carpathian Mountains and follows the Danube northwest through the Iron Gate where it gains a jet effect and continues to Belgrade and can spread as far south as Niš.[174]\n\n\nThe average annual air temperature for the period 1961–1990 for the area with an elevation of up to 300 m (984 ft) is 10.9 °C (51.6 °F). The areas with an elevation of 300 to 500 m (984 to 1,640 ft) have an average annual temperature of around 10.0 °C (50.0 °F), and over 1,000 m (3,281 ft) of elevation around 6.0 °C (42.8 °F).[175] The lowest recorded temperature in Serbia was −39.5 °C (−39.1 °F) on 13 January 1985, Karajukića Bunari in Pešter, and the highest was 44.9 °C (112.8 °F), on 24 July 2007, recorded in Smederevska Palanka.[176]\n\n\nSerbia is one of few European countries with *very high risk* exposure to natural hazards (earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts).[177] It is estimated that potential floods, particularly in areas of Central Serbia, threaten over 500 larger settlements and an area of 16,000 square kilometres.[178] The most disastrous were the floods in May 2014, when 57 people died and a damage of over a 1.5 billion euro was inflicted.[179]\n\n\n\n### Hydrology[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of rivers of Serbia and List of lakes of Serbia.\n\nAlmost all of Serbia's rivers drain to the Black Sea, by way of the Danube river. The Danube, the second largest European river, passes through Serbia with 588 kilometres[180] (21% of its overall length) and represents the major source of fresh water.[181][182] It is joined by its biggest tributaries, the Great Morava (longest river entirely in Serbia with 493 km (306 mi) of length[183]), Sava and Tisza rivers.[184] One notable exception is the Pčinja which flows into the Aegean. Drina river forms the natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, and represents the main kayaking and rafting attraction in both countries.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Iron Gates, Đerdap National Park\n![](image)\nPicea omorika is a species of coniferous tree endemic to the Tara mountain in western Serbia\n![](image)\nBabin Zub, Balkan Mountains, east Serbia.\n\nDue to configuration of the terrain, natural lakes are sparse and small; most of them are located in the lowlands of Vojvodina, like the aeolian lake Palić or numerous oxbow lakes along river flows (like Zasavica and Carska Bara). However, there are numerous artificial lakes, mostly due to hydroelectric dams, the biggest being Đerdap (Iron Gates) on the Danube with 163 km2 (63 sq mi) on the Serbian side[185] (a total area of 253 km2 (98 sq mi) is shared with Romania); Perućac on the Drina, and Vlasina. The largest waterfall, Jelovarnik, located in Kopaonik, is 71 m high.[186] Abundance of relatively unpolluted surface waters and numerous underground natural and mineral water sources of high water quality presents a chance for export and economy improvement; however, more extensive exploitation and production of bottled water began only recently.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of protected natural resources in Serbia and Environmental issues in Serbia\n\nSerbia is a country of rich ecosystem and species diversity—covering only 1.9% of the whole European territory, Serbia is home to 39% of European vascular flora, 51% of European fish fauna, 40% of European reptiles and amphibian fauna, 74% of European bird fauna, and 67% European mammal fauna.[187] Its abundance of mountains and rivers make it an ideal environment for a variety of animals, many of which are protected including wolves, lynx, bears, foxes, and stags. There are 17 snake species living all over the country, 8 of them are venomous.[188]\n\n\nMountain of Tara in western Serbia is one of the last regions in Europe where bears can still live in absolute freedom.[189][*better source needed*] Serbia is home to about 380 species of birds. In Carska Bara, there are over 300 bird species on just a few square\nkilometres.[190] Uvac Gorge is considered one of the last habitats of the Griffon vulture in Europe.[191] In area around the city of Kikinda, in the northernmost part of the country, some 145 endangered long-eared owls are noted, making it the world's biggest settlement of these species.[192] The country is considerably rich with threatened species of bats and butterflies as well.[193]\n\n\nThere are 380 protected areas of Serbia, encompassing 4,947 square kilometres or 6.4% of the country. The \"Spatial plan of the Republic of Serbia\" states that the total protected area should be increased to 12% by 2021.[187] Those protected areas include 5 national parks (Đerdap, Tara, Kopaonik, Fruška Gora and Šar Mountain), 15 nature parks, 15 \"landscapes of outstanding features\", 61 nature reserves, and 281 natural monuments.[186]\nWith 29.1% of its territory covered by forest, Serbia is considered to be a middle-forested country, compared on a global scale to world forest coverage at 30%, and European average of 35%. The total forest area in Serbia is 2,252,000 ha (1,194,000 ha or 53% are state-owned, and 1,058,387 ha or 47% are privately owned) or 0.3 ha per inhabitant.[194] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.29/10, ranking it 105th globally out of 172 countries.[195] The most common trees are oak, beech, pines, and firs.\n\n\nAir pollution is a significant problem in Bor area, due to work of large copper mining and smelting complex, and Pančevo where oil and petrochemical industry is based.[196] Some cities suffer from water supply problems, due to mismanagement and low investments in the past, as well as water pollution (like the pollution of the Ibar River from the Trepča zinc-lead combinate,[197] affecting the city of Kraljevo, or the presence of natural arsenic in underground waters in Zrenjanin).[198]\n\n\nPoor waste management has been identified as one of the most important environmental problems in Serbia and the recycling is a fledgling activity, with only 15% of its waste being turned back for reuse.[199] The 1999 NATO bombing caused serious damage to the environment, with several thousand tonnes of toxic chemicals stored in targeted factories and refineries released into the soil and water basins.[200]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Serbia\n\n![](image)\nHouse of the National Assembly.\n\nSerbia is a parliamentary republic, with the government divided into legislative, executive, and judiciary branches.\n\n\n\nSerbia had one of the first modern constitutions in Europe, the 1835 Constitution (known as the Sretenje Constitution), which was at the time considered among the most progressive and liberal constitutions in Europe.[201][202][*better source needed*] Since then it has adopted 10 different constitutions.[203] The current constitution was adopted in 2006 in the aftermath of the Montenegro independence referendum which by consequence renewed the independence of Serbia itself.[204] The Constitutional Court rules on matters regarding the Constitution.\n\nFile:2023 Belt and Road Forum representatives.jpgPresident Aleksandar Vučić at the 2023 Belt and Road Forum, Beijing, China.\nThe President of the Republic (*Predsednik Republike*) is the head of state, is elected by popular vote to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy.[205] Aleksandar Vučić of the Serbian Progressive Party is the current president following the 2017 presidential election.[206] Seat of the presidency is Novi Dvor.\n\n\nThe Government (*Vlada*) is composed of the prime minister and cabinet ministers. The Government is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies. The current prime minister is Ana Brnabić, nominated by the Serbian Progressive Party.[207]\n\n\nThe National Assembly (*Narodna skupština*) is a unicameral legislative body. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the Prime Minister and other ministers, declare war, and ratify international treaties and agreements.[208] It is composed of 250 proportionally elected members who serve four-year terms. Following the 2020 parliamentary election, the largest political parties in the National Assembly are the populist Serbian Progressive Party and Socialist Party of Serbia, that with its partners, hold more than a supermajority number of seats.[209]\n\n\nIn 2021, Serbia was the 5th country in Europe by the number of women holding high-ranking public functions.[210][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Law and criminal justice[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of Serbia and Crime in Serbia\n\n![](image)Court House or *Palata pravde* in Zrenjanin, administrative centre and largest city of the Central Banat District, north Serbia.\nSerbia is the fourth modern-day European country, after France, Austria and the Netherlands, to have a codified legal system.[211]\n\n\nThe country has a three-tiered judicial system, made up of the Supreme Court of Cassation as the court of the last resort, Courts of Appeal as the appellate instance, and Basic and High courts as the general jurisdictions at first instance.[212][213]\n\n\nCourts of special jurisdictions are the Administrative Court, commercial courts (including the Commercial Court of Appeal at second instance) and misdemeanor courts (including High Misdemeanor Court at second instance).[214] The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. Serbia has a typical civil law legal system.\n\n\nLaw enforcement is the responsibility of the Serbian Police, which is subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. Serbian Police fields 27,363 uniformed officers.[215]\nNational security and counterintelligence are the responsibility of the Security Intelligence Agency (BIA).[216]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Serbia\n\nSee also: Accession of Serbia to the European Union and Political status of Kosovo\n\n![](image)States which recognize the Province of Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia\nStates which recognize Kosovo as an independent country\n States that recognized Kosovo and later withdrew that recognition\n\nSerbia has established diplomatic relations with 191 UN member states, the Holy See, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the European Union.[217] Foreign relations are conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Serbia has a network of 65 embassies and 23 consulates internationally.[218] There are 69 foreign embassies, 5 consulates and 4 liaison offices in Serbia.[219][220]\nSerbian foreign policy is focused on achieving the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). Serbia started the process of joining the EU by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 29 April 2008 and officially applied for membership in the European Union on 22 December 2009.[221] It received a full candidate status on 1 March 2012 and started accession talks on 21 January 2014.[222][223] The European Commission considers accession possible by 2025.[224]\n\n\nOn 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia. In protest, Serbia initially recalled its ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo's independence.[225] The resolution of 26 December 2007 by the National Assembly stated that both the Kosovo declaration of independence and recognition thereof by any state would be gross violation of international law.[226]\n\n\nSerbia began cooperation and dialogue with NATO in 2006, when the country joined the Partnership for Peace programme and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The country's military neutrality was formally proclaimed by a resolution adopted by Serbia's parliament in December 2007, which makes joining any military alliance contingent on a popular referendum,[227][228] a stance acknowledged by NATO.[229][230][231] On the other hand, Serbia's relations with Russia are habitually described by mass media as a \"centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance\"[232] and Russia is said to have sought to solidify its relationship with Serbia since the imposition of sanctions against Russia in 2014.[233] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia voted to condemn the invasion, supporting the adoption of the United Nations draft resolution demanding Russia to withdraw its military forces from Ukraine.[234] However, Serbia is one of the only countries in Europe not to sanction Russia after the invasion.[235]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Serbian Armed Forces and Military history of Serbia\n\n\n\n**Branches of the Serbian Armed Forces**\n| ![](image)Special forces brigade4th Army Brigade | ![](image)Serbian Air Force and Air DefenceEurocopter EC145 |\n\n\nThe Serbian Armed Forces are subordinate to the Ministry of Defence, and are composed of the Army and the Air Force. Although a landlocked country, Serbia operates a River Flotilla which patrols on the Danube, Sava and Tisa rivers. The Serbian Chief of the General Staff reports to the Defence Minister. The Chief of Staff is appointed by the president, who is the commander-in-chief.[205] As of 2019[update], Serbian defence budget amounts to $804 million.[236]\n\n\nTraditionally having relied on a large number of conscripts, Serbian Armed Forces went through a period of downsizing, restructuring and professionalisation. Conscription was abolished in 2011.[237] Serbian Armed Forces have 28,000 active troops,[238] supplemented by the \"active reserve\" which numbers 20,000 members and \"passive reserve\" with about 170,000.[239][240]\n\n\nSerbia participates in the NATO Individual Partnership Action Plan programme,[229] but has no intention of joining NATO, due to significant popular rejection, largely a legacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999.[241] It is an observer member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) as of 2013.[242] The country also signed the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe. The Serbian Armed Forces take part in several multinational peacekeeping missions, including deployments in Lebanon, Cyprus, Ivory Coast, and Liberia.[243]\n\n\nSerbia is a major producer and exporter of military equipment in the region. Defence exports totaled around $600 million in 2018.[244] The defence industry has seen significant growth over the years and it continues to grow on a yearly basis.[245][246]\n\n\nSerbia is one of the countries with the largest number of firearms in the civilian population in the world.[247]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Serbia\n\n![](image)Banovina Palace Complex, Provincial government and the assembly of AP Vojvodina, northern province of Serbia\nSerbia is a unitary state[248] composed of municipalities/cities, districts, and two autonomous provinces. In Serbia, excluding Kosovo, there are 145 municipalities (*opštine*) and 29 cities (*gradovi*), which form the basic units of local self-government.[249] Apart from municipalities/cities, there are 24 districts (*okruzi*, 10 most populated listed below), with the City of Belgrade constituting an additional district. Except for Belgrade, which has an elected local government, districts are regional centres of state authority, but have no powers of their own; they present purely administrative divisions.[249]\nThe Constitution of Serbia recognizes two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina in the north, and the disputed territory of Kosovo and Metohija in the south,[249] while the remaining area of Central Serbia never had its own regional authority. Following the Kosovo War, UN peacekeepers entered Kosovo and Metohija, as per UNSC Resolution 1244. The government of Serbia does not recognise Kosovo's February 2008 declaration of independence, considering it illegal and illegitimate.[250]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.

Serbia is one of the European countries with the highest number of registered national minorities, while the province of Vojvodina is recognizable for its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural identity.[262][263][264] Despite a decline in recent years, with a population of 184,442, Hungarians are still the largest ethnic minority in Serbia, concentrated predominantly in northern Vojvodina and representing 2.8% of the country's population (10.5% in Vojvodina). Romani population stands at 131,936 according to the 2022 census but unofficial estimates place their actual number between 400,000 and 500,000.[265] Bosniaks with 153,801 and Muslims by nationality with 13,011 are concentrated in Raška (Sandžak), in the southwest. Other minority groups include Albanians, Croats and Bunjevci, Slovaks, Yugoslavs, Montenegrins, Romanians and Vlachs, Macedonians and Bulgarians. Chinese, estimated at 15,000, are the only significant non-European immigrant minority.[266][267] Most recently, tens of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have immigrated to Serbia following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.[268]\n\n\nThe majority of the population, or 59.4%, reside in urban areas and some 16.1% in Belgrade alone. Belgrade is the only city with more than a million inhabitants and there are four more with over 100,000 inhabitants.[269]\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in Serbia[269]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | District | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | District | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Novi Sad](image)Novi Sad | 1 | Belgrade | City of Belgrade | 1,197,714 | 11 | Kraljevo | Raška District | 61,490\n | ![Niš](image)Niš![Kragujevac](image)Kragujevac |\n| 2 | Novi Sad | South Bačka | 306,702 | 12 | Smederevo | Podunavlje District | 59,261\n |\n| 3 | Niš | Nišava District | 260,237 | 13 | Leskovac | Jablanica District | 58,338\n |\n| 4 | Kragujevac | Šumadija District | 146,315 | 14 | Valjevo | Kolubara District | 56,059\n |\n| 5 | Subotica | North Bačka | 94,228 | 15 | Vranje | Pčinja District | 55,214\n |\n| 6 | Pančevo | South Banat | 86,408 | 16 | Užice | Zlatibor District | 54,965\n |\n| 7 | Novi Pazar | Raška District | 71,462 | 17 | Požarevac | Braničevo District | 51,271\n |\n| 8 | Čačak | Moravica District | 69,598 | 18 | Šabac | Mačva District | 51,163\n |\n| 9 | Kruševac | Rasina District | 68,119 | 19 | Sombor | West Bačka | 41,814\n |\n| 10 | Zrenjanin | Central Banat | 67,129 | 20 | Sremska Mitrovica | Srem District | 40,144\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Religion in Serbia and Serbian Orthodox Church\n\n![](image)Church of Saint Sava in Belgrade, it is one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world.[270]\nThe Constitution of Serbia defines it as a secular state with guaranteed religious freedom. Orthodox Christians with 6,079,396 comprise 84.5% of country's population. The Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest and traditional church of the country, adherents of which are overwhelmingly Serbs. Other Orthodox Christian communities in Serbia include Montenegrins, Romanians, Vlachs, Macedonians and Bulgarians.\n\n\nIn 2011, Roman Catholics numbered 356,957 in Serbia, or roughly 6% of the population, mostly in northern Vojvodina which is home to ethnic minority groups such as Hungarians, Croats, and Bunjevci, as well as to some Slovaks and Czechs.[271]\n\n\nProtestantism accounts for about 1% of the country's population, chiefly Lutheranism among Slovaks in Vojvodina as well as Calvinism among Reformed Hungarians. Greek Catholic Church is adhered by around 25,000 citizens (0.37% of the population), mostly Rusyns in Vojvodina.[272]\n\n\nMuslims, with 222,282 or 3% of the population, form the third largest religious group. Islam has a strong historic following in the southern regions of Serbia, primarily in southern Raška. Bosniaks are the largest Islamic community in Serbia, followed by Albanians; estimates are that around a third of the country's Roma people are Muslim.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2011, there were only 578 Jews in Serbia,[273] compared to over 30,000 prior to World War II. Atheists numbered 80,053, or 1.1% of the population, and an additional 4,070 declared themselves to be agnostics.[273]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Serbia and Serbian language\n\n![](image)Standard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic and Latin script. Serbian is a rare example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them.\nThe official language is Serbian, native to 88% of the population.[273] Serbian is the only European language with active digraphia, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. Serbian Cyrillic is designated in the Constitution as the \"official script\" and was devised in 1814 by Serbian philologist Vuk Karadžić, who based it on phonemic principles.[274] A survey from 2014 showed that 47% of Serbians favour the Latin alphabet, 36% favour the Cyrillic one and 17% have no preference.[275]\n\n\nStandard Serbian is mutually intelligible with recognised minority languages of Bosnian and Croatian, as all three are based on the most widespread Shtokavian dialect from Eastern Herzegovina.[276] Other recognised minority languages are: Hungarian, Slovak, Albanian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Rusyn, and Macedonian. All these languages are in official use in municipalities or cities where the ethnic minority exceeds 15% of the total population.[277] In Vojvodina, the provincial administration co-officially uses, besides Serbian, five other languages (Slovak, Hungarian, Croatian, Romanian and Rusyn).\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Serbia\n\nThe healthcare system in Serbia is organized and managed by the three primary institutions: The Ministry of Health, The Institute of Public Health of Serbia \"Dr Milan Jovanović Batut\" and the Military Medical Academy. The right to healthcare protections is defined as a constitutional right in Serbia.[278] The Serbian public health system is based on the principles of equity and solidarity, organized on the model of compulsory health insurance contributions.[279] Private health care is not integrated into the public health system, but certain services may be included by contracting.[279]\n\n\n\n![](image)The newly opened wing of the University Clinical Centre of Serbia. CCS has 3,150 beds, considered to be the highest number in Europe, and among highest in the world.\nThe Ministry of Health determines the healthcare policy and adopts standards for the work of the healthcare service. The Ministry is also in charge of the health care system, health insurance, preservation and improvement of health of citizens, health inspection, supervision over the work of the healthcare service and other tasks in the field of health care.\n\n\nThe Institute of Public Health of Serbia \"Dr Milan Jovanović Batut\" is responsible for medical statistics, epidemiology and hygiene. This central, tertiary institution manages and coordinates a dense network of municipal and regional Centers of Public Health, spread across the entire country, that provide services in the domain of epidemiology and hygiene on the primary and secondary level.[280] The Republic Health Insurance Institute finances the functioning of health care at all levels.[281]\n\n\nOne of the most important health institutions in Serbia is the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade.[282] It takes care of about 30,000 patients a year (military and civilian insured). The Academy performs around 30,000 surgical interventions and more than 500,000 specialist examinations.[283]\n\n\nThe Clinical Centre of Serbia spreads over 34 hectares in Belgrade and consists of about 50 buildings, while also has 3,150 beds considered to be the highest number in Europe,[284] and among highest in the world.[285][*better source needed*]\n\n\nOther important health institutions include: KBC Dr Dragiša Mišović, Cardiovascular institute Detinje,[286] Clinical Centre of Kragujevac, Clinical Centre of Niš, Clinical Center of Vojvodina and others.\n\n\nMedical specialists from Serbia have performed a number of operations which have been described as \"pioneer works\".[287][288]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)NIS headquarters in Novi Sad\nMain article: Economy of Serbia\n\nSerbia has an emerging market economy in upper-middle income range.[289] According to the International Monetary Fund, Serbian nominal GDP in 2022 is officially estimated at $65.697 billion or $9,561 per capita while purchasing power parity GDP stood at $153.076 billion or $22,278 per capita.[290] The economy is dominated by services which accounts for 67.9% of GDP, followed by industry with 26.1% of GDP, and agriculture at 6% of GDP.[291] The official currency of Serbia is Serbian dinar (ISO code: RSD), and the central bank is National Bank of Serbia. The Belgrade Stock Exchange is the only stock exchange in the country, with market capitalisation of $8.65 billion and BELEX15 as the main index representing the 15 most liquid stocks.[292] The country is ranked 52nd on the Social Progress Index[293] as well as 51st on the Global Peace Index.[294]\n\n\nThe economy has been affected by the global economic crisis. After almost a decade of strong economic growth (average of 4.45% per year), Serbia entered the recession in 2009 with negative growth of −3% and again in 2012 and 2014 with −1% and −1.8%, respectively.[295] As the government was fighting effects of crisis the public debt has more than doubled: from pre-crisis level of just under 30% to about 70% of GDP and trending downwards recently to around 50%.[296][297] Labour force stands at 3.2 million, with 56% employed in services sector, 28.1% in industry and 15.9% in the agriculture.[298] The average monthly net salary in May 2019 stood at 47,575 dinars or $525.[299] The unemployment remains an acute problem, with rate of 12.7% as of 2018[update].[298]\n\n\nSince 2000, Serbia has attracted over $40 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI).[300] Blue-chip corporations making investments include: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Siemens, Bosch, Philip Morris, Michelin, Coca-Cola, Carlsberg and others.[301] In the energy sector, Russian energy giants, Gazprom and Lukoil have made large investments.[302] In metallurgy sector, Chinese steel and copper giants, Hesteel and Zijin Mining have acquired key complexes.[303]\n\n\nSerbia has an unfavourable trade balance: imports exceed exports by 25%. Serbia's exports, however, recorded a steady growth in last couple of years reaching $19.2 billion in 2018.[304] The country has free trade agreements with the EFTA and CEFTA, a preferential trade regime with the European Union, a Generalised System of Preferences with the United States, and individual free trade agreements with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Turkey.[305]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Serbia\n\n![](image)Serbia is one of the largest providers of frozen fruit to the EU and a big producer of fruits like raspberries, blackberries, apples and plums.[306][307]\nSerbia has very favourable natural conditions (land and climate) for varied agricultural production. It has 5,056,000 ha of agricultural land (0.7 ha per capita), out of which 3,294,000 ha is arable land (0.45 ha per capita).[308] In 2016, Serbia exported agricultural and food products worth $3.2 billion, and the export-import ratio was 178%.[309] Agricultural exports constitute more than one-fifth of all Serbia's sales on the world market. Serbia is one of the largest provider of frozen fruit to the EU (largest to the French market, and 2nd largest to the German market).[310]\n\n\nAgricultural production is most prominent in Vojvodina on the fertile Pannonian Plain. Other agricultural regions include Mačva, Pomoravlje, Tamnava, Rasina, and Jablanica.[311]\n\n\nIn the structure of the agricultural production, 70% is from the crop field production and 30% is from the livestock production.[311] Serbia is world's second largest producer of plums (582,485 tonnes; second to China), second largest of raspberries (89,602 tonnes, second to Poland), it is also a significant producer of maize (6.48 million tonnes, ranked 32nd in the world) and wheat (2.07 million tonnes, ranked 35th in the world).[186][312] Other important agricultural products are: sunflower, sugar beet, soybean, potato, apple, pork meat, beef, poultry and dairy.[313]\n\n\nThere are 56,000 ha of vineyards in Serbia, producing about 230 million litres of wine annually.[186][308] The most famous viticulture regions are located in Vojvodina and Šumadija.[314]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Automotive industry in Serbia\n\n![](image)Serbia Product Exports map 2019\n![](image)The Fiat 500L is manufactured in the FCA plant in Kragujevac.\nThe industry was the economic sector hardest hit by the UN sanctions and trade embargo and NATO bombing during the 1990s and transition to market economy during the 2000s.[315] The industrial output saw dramatic downsizing: in 2013 it was expected to be only a half of that of 1989.[316] Main industrial sectors include: automotive, mining, non-ferrous metals, food-processing, electronics, pharmaceuticals, clothes. Serbia has 14 free economic zones as of September 2017,[317] in which many foreign direct investments are realised.\n\n\nAutomotive industry (with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as a forebear) is dominated by cluster located in Kragujevac and its vicinity, and contributes to export with about $2 billion.[318] Country is a leading steel producer in the wider region of Southeast Europe and had production of nearly 2 million tonnes of raw steel in 2018, coming entirely from Smederevo steel mill, owned by the Chinese Hesteel.[319] Serbia's mining industry is comparatively strong: Serbia is the 18th largest producer of coal (7th in Europe) extracted from large deposits in Kolubara and Kostolac basins; it is also world's 23rd largest (3rd in Europe) producer of copper which is extracted by Zijin Bor Copper, a large copper mining company, acquired by Chinese Zijin Mining in 2018; significant gold extraction is developed around Majdanpek. Serbia notably manufactures intel smartphones named Tesla smartphones.[320]\n\n\nFood industry is well known both regionally and internationally and is one of the strong points of the economy.[321] Some of the international brand-names established production in Serbia: PepsiCo and Nestlé in food-processing sector; Coca-Cola (Belgrade), Heineken (Novi Sad) and Carlsberg (Bačka Palanka) in beverage industry; Nordzucker in sugar industry.[310] Serbia's electronics industry had its peak in the 1980s and the industry today is only a third of what it was back then, but has witnessed a something of revival in last decade with investments of companies such as Siemens (wind turbines) in Subotica, Panasonic (lighting devices) in Svilajnac, and Gorenje (electrical home appliances) in Valjevo.[322] The pharmaceutical industry in Serbia comprises a dozen manufacturers of generic drugs, of which Hemofarm in Vršac and Galenika in Belgrade, account for 80% of production volume. Domestic production meets over 60% of the local demand.[323]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Serbia\n\nThe energy sector is one of the largest and most important sectors to the country's economy. Serbia is a net exporter of electricity and importer of key fuels (such as oil and gas).\n\n\nSerbia has an abundance of coal, and significant reserves of oil and gas. Serbia's proven reserves of 5.5 billion tonnes of coal lignite are the fifth largest in the world (second in Europe, after Germany).[324][325]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nĐerdap 1 Hydroelectric Power Station, the largest dam on the Danube river and one of the largest hydro power stations in Europe.[326]\n![](image)\nAlibunar Wind Farm, Alibunar, Vojvodina Province, north east Serbia.\n\nCoal is found in two large deposits: Kolubara (4 billion tonnes of reserves) and Kostolac (1.5 billion tonnes).[324] Despite being small on a world scale, Serbia's oil and gas resources (77.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent and 48.1 billion cubic metres, respectively) have a certain regional importance since they are largest in the region of former Yugoslavia as well as the Balkans (excluding Romania).[327] Almost 90% of the discovered oil and gas are to be found in Banat and those oil and gas fields are by size among the largest in the Pannonian basin but are average on a European scale.[328]\n\n\nThe production of electricity in 2015 in Serbia was 36.5 billion kilowatt-hours (KWh), while the final electricity consumption amounted to 35.5 billion kilowatt-hours (KWh).[329] Most of the electricity produced comes from thermal-power plants (72.7% of all electricity) and to a lesser degree from hydroelectric-power plants (27.3%).[330] There are 6 lignite-operated thermal-power plants with an installed power of 3,936 MW; largest of which are 1,502 MW-Nikola Tesla 1 and 1,160 MW-Nikola Tesla 2, both in Obrenovac.[331] Total installed power of 9 hydroelectric-power plants is 2,831 MW, largest of which is Đerdap 1 with capacity of 1,026 MW.[332] In addition to this, there are mazute and gas-operated thermal-power plants with an installed power of 353 MW.[333] The entire production of electricity is concentrated in Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), public electric-utility power company.\n\n\nThe current oil production in Serbia amounts to over 1.1 million tonnes of oil equivalent[334] and satisfies some 43% of country's needs while the rest is imported.[335] National petrol company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), was acquired in 2008 by Gazprom Neft. The company's refinery in Pančevo (capacity of 4.8 million tonnes) is one of the most modern oil-refineries in Europe; it also operates network of 334 filling stations in Serbia (74% of domestic market) and additional 36 stations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 31 in Bulgaria, and 28 in Romania.[336][337] There are 155 kilometres of crude oil pipelines connecting Pančevo and Novi Sad refineries as a part of trans-national Adria oil pipeline.[338]\n\n\nSerbia is heavily dependent on foreign sources of natural gas, with only 17% coming from domestic production (totalling 491 million cubic metres in 2012) and the rest is imported, mainly from Russia (via gas pipelines that run through Ukraine and Hungary).[335] Srbijagas, public company, operates the natural gas transportation system which comprise 3,177 kilometres (1,974 mi) of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines and a 450 million cubic metre underground gas storage facility at Banatski Dvor.[339] In 2021, Balkan Stream gas pipeline opened through Serbia.[340]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Serbia\n\nSerbia has a strategic transportation location since the country's backbone, Morava Valley, represents the easiest land route from continental Europe to Asia Minor and the Near East.[341]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAir Serbia's airplane taking off from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport.\n![](image)\nSrbija Voz's *Soko* train on the rail line connecting the two major cities of Serbia, Belgrade and Novi Sad.\n\nSerbian road network carries the bulk of traffic in the country. Total length of roads is 45,419 km (28,222 mi) of which 962 km (598 mi) are \"class-IA state roads\" (i.e. motorways); 4,517 km (2,807 mi) are \"class-IB state roads\" (national roads); 10,941 km (6,798 mi) are \"class-II state roads\" (regional roads) and 23,780 km (14,780 mi) are \"municipal roads\".[342][343][344] The road network, except for the most of class-IA roads, are of comparatively lower quality to the Western European standards because of lack of financial resources for their maintenance in the last 20 years.\n\n\nOver 300 km (190 mi) of new motorways were constructed in the last decade and additional 154 km (96 mi) are currently under construction: A5 motorway (from north of Kruševac to Čačak) and 31 km (19 mi)-long segment of A2 (between Čačak and Požega).[345][346] Coach transport is very extensive: almost every place in the country is connected by bus, from largest cities to the villages; in addition there are international routes (mainly to countries of Western Europe with large Serb diaspora). Routes, both domestic and international, are served by more than hundred intercity coach services, biggest of which are Lasta and Niš-Ekspres. As of 2018[update], there were 1,999,771 registered passenger cars or 1 passenger car per 3.5 inhabitants.[347]\n\n\n\n![](image)Motorway network in Serbia (also showing Kosovo):  \nIn service\nUnder construction\nPlanned\n\nSerbia has 3,819 km (2,373 mi) of rail tracks, of which 1,279 km (795 mi) are electrified and 283 km (176 mi) are double-track railroad.[186] The major rail hub is Belgrade (and to a lesser degree Niš), while the most important railroads include: Belgrade–Subotica–Budapest (Hungary) (currently upgraded to high-speed status), Belgrade–Bar (Montenegro), Belgrade–Šid–Zagreb (Croatia)/Belgrade–Niš–Sofia (Bulgaria) (part of Pan-European Corridor X), and Niš–Thessaloniki (Greece). Some 75 km (46 mi) of new high-speed rail line between Belgrade and Novi Sad was opened in 2022 and additional 108 km (67 mi) from Novi Sad to Subotica and border with Hungary are currently under construction and due to open in 2025. Construction work for 212 km-long prolongation of the high-speed rail line to the south, to the city of Niš, is set to commence in 2024 and with its planned completion by the end of the decade four of country's five largest cities will be connected by the high-speed rail lines.[348][349][350] Rail services are operated by Srbija Voz (passenger transport) and Srbija Kargo (freight transport).[351]\n\n\nThere are three airports with regular passenger services reaching over 6 million passengers in 2022 with Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport serving bulk of it, being a hub of flagship carrier Air Serbia which flies to 80 destinations in 32 countries (including intercontinental flights to New York City, Chicago and Tianjin) and carried 2.75 million passengers in 2022.[352][353]\n\n\nSerbia has a developed inland water transport since there are 1,716 km (1,066 mi) of navigable inland waterways (1,043 km, 648 mi of navigable rivers and 673 km, 418 mi of navigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the country.[186] The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-European Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and Timiş Rivers, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Eastern Europe via the Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the Sava river. More than 8 million tonnes of cargo were transported on Serbian rivers and canals in 2018 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad, Belgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac.[354][355]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Serbia\n\nFixed telephone lines connect 81% of households in Serbia, and with about 9.1 million users the number of cellphones surpasses the total population of by 28%.[356] The largest mobile operator is Telekom Srbija with 4.2 million subscribers, followed by Telenor with 2.8 million users and A1 with about 2 million.[356] Some 58% of households have fixed-line (non-mobile) broadband Internet connection while 67% are provided with pay television services (i.e. 38% cable television, 17% IPTV, and 10% satellite).[356] Digital television transition has been completed in 2015 with DVB-T2 standard for signal transmission.[357][358]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Serbia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nClockwise from left: 1. Kopaonik ski resort 2. Studenica Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 3. Golubac Fortress. 4. Subotica, a city built in Art Nouveau style.\n\nSerbia is not a mass-tourism destination but nevertheless has a diverse range of touristic products.[359] In 2019, total of over 3.6 million tourists were recorded in accommodations, of which half were foreign.[360] Foreign exchange earnings from tourism were estimated at $1.5 billion.[361]\n\n\nTourism is mainly focused on the mountains and spas of the country, which are mostly visited by domestic tourists, as well as Belgrade and, to a lesser degree, Novi Sad, which are preferred choices of foreign tourists (almost two-thirds of all foreign visits are made to these two cities).[362][363] The most famous mountain resorts are Kopaonik, Stara Planina and Zlatibor. There are also many spas in Serbia, the biggest of which are Vrnjačka Banja, Soko Banja, and Banja Koviljača. City-break and conference tourism is developed in Belgrade and Novi Sad.[364] Other touristic products that Serbia offer are natural wonders like Đavolja varoš,[365] Christian pilgrimage to the many Orthodox monasteries across the country and the river cruising along the Danube. There are several internationally popular music festivals held in Serbia, such as EXIT (with 25–30,000 foreign visitors coming from 60 countries) and the Guča trumpet festival.[366]\n\n\n\n## Education and science[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Serbia\n\nAccording to 2011 census, literacy in Serbia stands at 98% of population while computer literacy is at 49% (complete computer literacy is at 34.2%).[367] Same census showed the following levels of education: 16.2% of inhabitants have higher education (10.6% have bachelors or master's degrees, 5.6% have an associate degree), 49% have a secondary education, 20.7% have an elementary education, and 13.7% have not completed elementary education.[368]\n\n\nEducation in Serbia is regulated by the Ministry of Education and Science. Education starts in either preschools or elementary schools. Children enroll in elementary schools at the age of seven. Compulsory education consists of eight grades of elementary school. Students have the opportunity to attend gymnasiums and vocational schools for another four years, or to enroll in vocational training for 2 to 3 years.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNikola Tesla contributed to the modern AC electricity supply system.[369]\n![](image)\nMilutin Milanković was an important climate science theorist.[370]\n\nFollowing the completion of gymnasiums or vocational schools, students have the opportunity to attend university.[371] Elementary and secondary education are also available in languages of recognised minorities in Serbia, where classes are held in Hungarian, Slovak, Albanian, Romanian, Rusyn, Bulgarian as well as Bosnian and Croatian languages. Petnica Science Center is a notable institution for extracurricular science education focusing on gifted students.[372]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Belgrade\n![](image)Matica Srpska, the oldest scientific institution in Serbia, located in Novi Sad.\nThere are 19 universities in Serbia (nine public universities with a total number of 86 faculties and ten private universities with 51 faculties).[373] In 2018/2019 academic year, 210,480 students attended 19 universities (181,310 at public universities and some 29,170 at private universities) while 47,169 attended 81 \"higher schools\".[186][374] Public universities in Serbia are: the University of Belgrade (oldest, founded in 1808, and largest university with 97,696 undergraduates and graduates[374]), University of Novi Sad (founded in 1960 and with student body of 42,489),[374] University of Niš (founded in 1965; 20,559 students),[374] University of Kragujevac (founded in 1976; 14,053 students), University of Priština (located in North Mitrovica), Public University of Novi Pazar as well as three specialist universities – University of Arts, University of Defence and University of Criminal Investigation and Police Studies. Largest private universities include Megatrend University and Singidunum University, both in Belgrade, and Educons University in Novi Sad. The University of Belgrade (placed in 301–400 bracket on 2013 Shanghai Ranking of World Universities, being best-placed university in Southeast Europe after those in Athens and Thessaloniki) and University of Novi Sad are generally considered the best institutions of higher learning in the country.[375]\n\n\nSerbia spent 0.9% of GDP on scientific research in 2017, which is slightly below the European average.[376] Serbia was ranked 53rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 57th in 2019.[377][378][379] Since 2018, Serbia is a full member of CERN.[380][381] Serbia has a long history of excellence in maths and computer sciences which has created a strong pool of engineering talent, although economic sanctions during the 1990s and chronic underinvestment in research forced many scientific professionals to leave the country.[382] Nevertheless, there are several areas in which Serbia still excels such as growing information technology sector, which includes software development as well as outsourcing. It generated over $1.2 billion in exports in 2018, both from international investors and a significant number of dynamic homegrown enterprises.[383] Serbia is one of the countries with the highest proportion of women in science.[384]\nAmong the scientific institutes operating in Serbia, the largest are the Mihajlo Pupin Institute and Vinča Nuclear Institute, both in Belgrade. The Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts is a learned society promoting science and arts from its inception in 1841.[385]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Serbian culture\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Serbia.\nFor centuries straddling the boundaries between East and West, the territory of Serbia had been divided among the Eastern and Western halves of the Roman Empire; then between Byzantium and the Kingdom of Hungary; and in the early modern period between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Empire. These overlapping influences have resulted in cultural varieties throughout Serbia; its north leans to the profile of Central Europe, while the south is characteristic of the wider Balkans and even the Mediterranean. The Byzantine influence on Serbia was profound, first through the introduction of Eastern Christianity in the Early Middle Ages. The Serbian Orthodox Church has many monasteries built in the Serbian Middle Ages. Serbia was influenced by the Republic of Venice as well, mainly though trade, literature and romanesque architecture.[386][387]\n\n\nSerbia has five cultural monuments inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage: the early medieval capital Stari Ras and the 13th-century monastery Sopoćani; the 12th-century Studenica monastery; the Roman complex of Gamzigrad–Felix Romuliana; medieval tombstones Stećci; and finally the endangered Medieval Monuments in Kosovo (the monasteries of Visoki Dečani, Our Lady of Ljeviš, Gračanica and Patriarchal Monastery of Peć).[388]\n\n\nThere are two literary works on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme: the 12th-century *Miroslav Gospel*, and scientist Nikola Tesla's archive. The *slava* (patron saint veneration), kolo (traditional folk dance), singing to the accompaniment of the gusle, Zlakusa pottery and slivovitz (plum brandy)[389] are inscribed on UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. The Ministry of Culture and Information is tasked with preserving the nation's cultural heritage and overseeing its development, with further activities undertaken by local governments.\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Serbian art and Serbian architecture\n\n![](image)Mileševa monastery's White Angel fresco (1235).\nTraces of Roman and early Byzantine Empire architectural heritage are found in many royal cities and palaces in Serbia, such as Sirmium, Felix Romuliana and Justiniana Prima, since 535 the seat of the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima.[390]\n\n\nSerbian monasteries were under the influence of Byzantine Art, particularly after the fall of Constantinople in 1204 when many Byzantine artists fled to Serbia.[391] The monasteries include Studenica (built around 1190), which was a model for such later monasteries as Mileševa, Sopoćani, Žiča, Gračanica and Visoki Dečani. Numerous monuments and cultural sites were destroyed at various stages of Serbian history, including destruction in Kosovo. In the late 14th and the 15th centuries, an autochthonous architectural style known as Morava style evolved in the area around Morava Valley. A characteristic of this style was the wealthy decoration of the frontal church walls. Examples of this include Manasija, Ravanica and Kalenić monasteries.\n\n\nFrescos include White Angel (Mileševa monastery), *Crucifixion* (Studenica monastery) and *Dormition of the Virgin* (Sopoćani).[392]\n\n\nThe country is dotted with many well-preserved medieval fortifications and castles such as Smederevo Fortress (largest lowland fortress in Europe),[393] Golubac, Maglič, Soko grad, Belgrade Fortress, Ostrvica and Ram.\n\n\nUnder Ottoman occupation, Serbian art was virtually non-existent outside the lands ruled by the Habsburg monarchy. Traditional Serbian art showed Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of Nikola Nešković, Teodor Kračun, Zaharije Orfelin and Jakov Orfelin.[394]\n\n\n\n![](image)Performance artist Marina Abramović\nSerbian painting showed the influence of Biedermeier and Neoclassicism as seen in works by Konstantin Danil,[395] Arsenije Teodorović and Pavel Đurković.[396] Many painters followed the artistic trends set in the 19th century Romanticism, notably Đura Jakšić, Stevan Todorović, Katarina Ivanović and Novak Radonić.[397][398]\n\n\nSerbian painters of the first half of the 20th century include Paja Jovanović and Uroš Predić of Realism, Cubist Sava Šumanović, Milena Pavlović-Barili and Nadežda Petrović of Impressionism, Expressionist Milan Konjović. Painters of the second half of 20th century include Marko Čelebonović, Petar Lubarda, Milo Milunović, Ljubomir Popović and Vladimir Veličković.[399]\n\n\nAnastas Jovanović was one of the earliest photographers in the world. Marina Abramović is a performance artist. Pirot carpet is a traditional handicraft in Serbia.[400][401]\n\n\nThere are around 180 museums in Serbia,[402] including the National Museum of Serbia, founded in 1844, houses one of the largest art collections in the Balkans, including many foreign pieces.[403] Other art museums include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade, the Museum of Vojvodina and the Gallery of Matica Srpska in Novi Sad.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Serbian literature\n\n![](image)Miroslav's Gospel (1186) is a 362-page illuminated manuscript on parchment listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.\nSerbian uses the Cyrillic alphabet created by the students of the brothers Cyril and Methodius at the Preslav Literary School in Bulgaria.[404][405] Serbian works from the early 11th century are written in Glagolitic. Starting in the 12th century, books were written in Cyrillic. The Miroslav Gospels from 1186 are considered to be the oldest book of Serbian medieval history and are listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.[406]\n\n\nMedieval authors include Saint Sava, Jefimija, Stefan Lazarević, Constantine of Kostenets and others.[407] Under Ottoman occupation, when Serbia was not part of the European Renaissance, the tradition of oral story-telling through epic poetry was inspired by the Kosovo battle and folk tales rooted in Slavic mythology. Serbian epic poetry in those times was seen as the most effective way in preserving the national identity.[408][409] The oldest known, entirely fictional poems, make up the *Non-historic cycle*, which is followed by poems inspired by events before, during and after the Battle of Kosovo. Some cycles are dedicated to Serbian legendary hero, Marko Kraljević, others are about hajduks and uskoks, and the last one is dedicated to the liberation of Serbia in the 19th century. Folk ballads include *The Death of the Mother of the Jugović Family* and *The Mourning Song of the Noble Wife of the Asan Aga* (1646), translated into European languages by Goethe, Walter Scott, Pushkin and Mérimée. A tale from Serbian folklore is The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples.[410]\n\n\nBaroque trends in Serbian literature emerged in the late 17th century. Baroque-influenced authors include Gavril Stefanović Venclović, Jovan Rajić, Zaharije Orfelin and Andrija Zmajević.[411] Dositej Obradović was a prominent figure of the Age of Enlightenment, while Jovan Sterija Popović was a Classicist writer whose works also contained elements of Romanticism.[412] In the era of national revival, in the first half of the 19th century, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić collected Serbian folk literature, and reformed the Serbian language and spelling,[413] paving the way for Serbian Romanticism. The first half of the 19th century was dominated by Romanticist writers, including Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, Branko Radičević, Đura Jakšić, Jovan Jovanović Zmaj and Laza Kostić, while the second half of the century was marked by Realist writers such as Milovan Glišić, Laza Lazarević, Simo Matavulj, Stevan Sremac, Vojislav Ilić, Branislav Nušić, Radoje Domanović and Borisav Stanković.\n\n\nThe 20th century was dominated by the prose writers Meša Selimović (*Death and the Dervish*), Miloš Crnjanski (*Migrations*), Isidora Sekulić (*The Chronicle of a Small Town Cemetery*), Branko Ćopić (*Eagles Fly Early*), Borislav Pekić (*The Time of Miracles*), Danilo Kiš (*The Encyclopedia of the Dead*), Dobrica Ćosić (*The Roots*), Aleksandar Tišma (*The Use of Man*), Milorad Pavić and others.[414][415] Notable poets include Milan Rakić, Jovan Dučić, Vladislav Petković Dis, Rastko Petrović, Stanislav Vinaver, Dušan Matić, Branko Miljković, Vasko Popa, Oskar Davičo, Miodrag Pavlović, and Stevan Raičković.[416]\n\n\n\n![](image)Writer Ivo Andrić, Nobel prize winner in 1961 and Dobrica Ćosić, novelist, essayist, and politician.\nPavić is a 21st-century Serbian author whose *Dictionary of the Khazars* has been translated into 38 languages.[417] Contemporary authors include David Albahari, Svetislav Basara, Goran Petrović, Gordana Kuić, Vuk Drašković and Vladislav Bajac. Serbian comics emerged in the 1930s and the medium remains popular today.\n\n\nIvo Andrić (*The Bridge on the Drina*) is a Serbian author [418] who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. Another writer was Desanka Maksimović, who for seven decades was *the leading lady of Yugoslav poetry*.[419][420][421][422][423] She is honoured with statues, postage stamps, and the names of streets across Serbia.[424][425][426]\n\n\nThere are 551 public libraries, the largest of which are: the National Library of Serbia in Belgrade with about 6 million items, and Matica Srpska (the oldest matica and Serbian cultural institution, founded in 1826) in Novi Sad with nearly 3.5 million volumes.[427][428] In 2010, there were 10,989 books and brochures published.[186] The book publishing market is dominated by several major publishers such as Laguna and Vulkan (both of which operate their own bookstore chains) and the industry's centrepiece event, annual Belgrade Book Fair, is the most visited cultural event in Serbia with 158,128 visitors in 2013.[429] The highlight of the literary scene is awarding of NIN Prize, given every January since 1954 for the best newly published novel in Serbian.[430][431]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Serbia\n\nComposer and musicologist Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac is considered the founder of modern Serbian music.[432][433] The Serbian composers of the first generation Petar Konjović, Stevan Hristić, and Miloje Milojević maintained the national expression and modernised the romanticism into the direction of impressionism.[434][435] Other famous classical Serbian composers include Isidor Bajić, Stanislav Binički and Josif Marinković.[436][437] There are three opera houses in Serbia: Opera of the National Theatre and Madlenianum Opera, both in Belgrade, and Opera of the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. Four symphonic orchestra operate in the country: Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra, Niš Symphony Orchestra, Novi Sad Philharmonic Orchestra and Symphonic Orchestra of Radio Television of Serbia. The Choir of Radio Television of Serbia is a leading vocal ensemble in the country.[438] The BEMUS is one of the most prominent classical music festivals in the Southeastern Europe.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Filip Višnjić sings to the gusle* by Sreten Stojanović, Kruševac, central Serbia.\nTraditional Serbian music includes various kinds of bagpipes, flutes, horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries, drums and cymbals. The *kolo* is the traditional collective folk dance, which has a number of varieties throughout the regions. The most popular are those from Užice and Morava region. Sung epic poetry has been an integral part of Serbian and Balkan music for centuries. In the highlands of Serbia these long poems are typically accompanied on a one-string fiddle called the *gusle*, and concern themselves with themes from history and mythology. There are records of *gusle* being played at the court of the 13th-century King Stefan Nemanjić.[439]\n\n\nPop music artist Željko Joksimović won second place at the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest and Marija Šerifović won the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Molitva\", and Serbia was the host of the 2008 edition of the contest. Pop singers include Zdravko Čolić, Vlado Georgiev, Aleksandra Radović, Jelena Tomašević and Nataša Bekvalac, among others.\n\n\nSerbian rock was part of the former Yugoslav rock scene during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. During the 1990s and 2000s, the popularity of rock music declined in Serbia,[440] and although several major mainstream acts managed to sustain their popularity, an underground and independent music scene developed.[441] The 2000s saw a revival of the mainstream scene and the appearance of a large number of notable acts. Serbian rock acts include Atheist Rap, Bajaga i Instruktori, Đorđe Balašević, Bjesovi, Block Out, Crni Biseri, Darkwood Dub, Disciplina Kičme, Elipse, Ekatarina Velika, Električni Orgazam, Eva Braun, Galija, Generacija 5, Goblini, Idoli, Kanda, Kodža i Nebojša, Kerber, Korni Grupa, Laboratorija Zvuka, Slađana Milošević, Neverne Bebe, Obojeni Program, Orthodox Celts, Partibrejkers, Pekinška Patka, Piloti, Riblja Čorba, Ritam Nereda, Rambo Amadeus, S.A.R.S., Siluete, S Vremena Na Vreme, Šarlo Akrobata, Pop Mašina, Smak, U Škripcu, Van Gogh, YU Grupa, Zana and others.\n\n\nFolk music in its original form has been a prominent music style since World War I following the early success of Sofka Nikolić. The music has been further promoted by Danica Obrenić, Anđelija Milić, Nada Mamula, and during the 60s and 70s with performers like Silvana Armenulić, Toma Zdravković, Lepa Lukić, Vasilija Radojčić, Vida Pavlović and Gordana Stojićević.\n\n\n\n![](image)Exit Festival in Novi Sad, proclaimed as *the Best Major European festival* at the EU Festival Awards[442]\nTurbo-folk music is a subgenre that was developed in Serbia in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s[443] and has since enjoyed an immense popularity[444] through acts of Dragana Mirković, Zorica Brunclik, Šaban Šaulić, Ana Bekuta, Sinan Sakić, Vesna Zmijanac, Mile Kitić, Snežana Đurišić, Šemsa Suljaković, and Nada Topčagić. It is a blend of folk music with pop and dance elements and can be seen as a result of the urbanisation of folk music. In recent years, turbo-folk has featured even more pop music elements, and some of the performers have been labeled as pop-folk. The most famous among them are Ceca (often considered to be the biggest music star of Serbia[445]), Jelena Karleuša,[446] Aca Lukas, Seka Aleksić, Dara Bubamara, Indira Radić, Saša Matić, Viki Miljković, Stoja and Lepa Brena, arguably the most prominent performer of former Yugoslavia.[447]\n\n\nBalkan Brass, or *truba* (\"trumpet\") is a popular genre, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass originated. The music has its tradition from the First Serbian Uprising. The trumpet was used as a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles, and it took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying births, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. There are two main varieties of this genre, one from Western Serbia and the other from Southern Serbia, with brass musician Boban Marković being one of the most respected names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders.[448]\n\n\nThe most popular music festivals are Guča Trumpet Festival, with over 300,000 annual visitors, and EXIT in Novi Sad (won the Best Major Festival award at the European Festivals Awards for 2013 and 2017.), with 200,000 visitors in 2013.[449][450] Other festivals include Nišville Jazz Festival in Niš and Gitarijada rock festival in Zaječar.\n\n\n\n### Theatre and cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Serbia\n\nSerbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with Joakim Vujić considered the founder of modern Serbian theatre.[451] Serbia has 38 professional theatres and 11 theatres for children,[452] the most important of which are National Theatre in Belgrade, Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad, National Theatre in Subotica, National Theatre in Niš and Knjaževsko-srpski teatar in Kragujevac (the oldest theatre in Serbia, established in 1835). The Belgrade International Theatre Festival – BITEF, founded in 1967, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world, and it has become one of the five biggest European festivals.[453][454] Sterijino pozorje is, on the other hand, a festival showcasing national drama plays. The most important Serbian playwrights were Jovan Sterija Popović and Branislav Nušić, while recent renowned names are Dušan Kovačević and Biljana Srbljanović.[455]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nEmir Kusturica won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes twice\n![](image)\nŽelimir Žilnik won the Golden Bear at the Berlinale\n\nThe foundation of Serbian cinema dates back to 1896. The first Serbian feature film, titled *The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Leader Karađorđe*, was released in 1911.[456][457]\n\n\nSerbia's film scene is one of the most dynamic smaller European cinemas. Serbia's film industry is heavily subsidized by the government, mainly through grants approved by the Film Centre of Serbia.[458] As of 2019, there were 26 feature films produced in Serbia, of which 14 were domestic films.[459] There are 23 operating cinemas in the country, of which 13 are multiplexes (all but two belonging to either Cineplexx or CineStar chains), with total attendance reaching 4.8 million. A comparatively high percentage of 20% of total tickets sold were for domestic films.[460] Modern PFI Studios located in Šimanovci is nowadays Serbia's only major film studio complex; it consists of 9 sound stages and attracts mainly international productions, primarily American and West European.[461] The Yugoslav Film Archive used to be former Yugoslavia's and now is Serbia's national film archive – with over 100 thousand film prints, it is among the five largest film archives in the world.[462][463]\n\n\nFamous Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica won two Palmes d'Or for Best Feature Film at the Cannes Film Festival, for *When Father Was Away on Business* in 1985 and then again for *Underground* in 1995; he has also won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for *Arizona Dream* and a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival for *Black Cat, White Cat*.[464] Other renowned directors include Dušan Makavejev, Želimir Žilnik (Golden Berlin Bear winner), Aleksandar Petrović, Živojin Pavlović, Goran Paskaljević, Goran Marković, Srđan Dragojević, Srdan Golubović and Mila Turajlić among others. Serbian-American screenwriter Steve Tesich won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1979 for the movie Breaking Away.\n\n\nProminent movie stars in Serbia have left a celebrated heritage in the cinematography of Yugoslavia as well. Notable mentions are Zoran Radmilović, Pavle Vuisić, Ljubiša Samardžić, Olivera Marković, Mija Aleksić, Miodrag Petrović Čkalja, Ružica Sokić, Velimir Bata Živojinović, Danilo Bata Stojković, Seka Sablić, Olivera Katarina, Dragan Nikolić, Mira Stupica, Nikola Simić, Bora Todorović and others. Milena Dravić was one of the most celebrated actresses in Serbian cinematography, winning the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980.[465][466]\n\n\nSerbian actress Jasna Đuričić was named the best actress in Europe for 2021 at the 34th European Film Awards (EFA) for the Bosnian movie \"Quo vadis, Aida\".\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Serbia\n\nFreedom of the press and freedom of speech are guaranteed by the constitution of Serbia.[467] Serbia is ranked 90th out of 180 countries in the 2019 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders.[468] The report noted that media outlets and journalists continue to face partisan and government pressure over editorial policies. Also, the media are now more heavily dependent on advertising contracts and government subsidies to survive financially.[469][470][471]\n\n\nAccording to EBU research in 2018, Serbs on average watch five and a half hours of television per day, making it the second highest average in Europe.[472] There are seven nationwide free-to-air television channels, with public broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) operating three (RTS1, RTS2 and RTS3) and private broadcasters operating four (Pink, Prva, Happy, and O2). In 2019, preferred usage of these channels was as follows: 19.3% for RTS1, 17.6% for Pink, 10.5% for Prva, 6.9% for Happy, 4.1% for O2, and 1.6% for RTS2.[473] There are 28 regional television channels and 74 local television channels.[186] Besides terrestrial channels there are dozens of Serbian television channels available only on cable or satellite. These include regional news N1, commercial channel Nova S, and regional sports channels Sport Klub and Arena Sport, among others.\n\n\nThere are 247 radio stations in Serbia.[186] Out of these, six are radio stations with national coverage, including two of public broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia (Radio Belgrade 1 and Radio Belgrade 2/Radio Belgrade 3) and four private ones (Radio S1, Radio S2, Play Radio, and Radio Hit FM). Also, there are 34 regional stations and 207 local stations.[474]\n\n\nThere are 305 newspapers published in Serbia[475] of which 12 are daily newspapers. Dailies *Politika* and *Danas* are Serbia's papers of record, the former being the oldest newspaper in the Balkans, founded in 1904.[476] Highest circulation newspapers are tabloids *Večernje Novosti*, *Blic*, *Kurir*, and *Informer*, all with more than 100,000 copies sold.[477] There is one daily newspaper devoted to sports (*Sportski žurnal*), one business daily (*Privredni pregled*), two regional newspapers (*Dnevnik* published in Novi Sad and *Narodne novine* from Niš), and one minority-language daily (*Magyar Szo* in Hungarian, published in Subotica).\n\n\nThere are 1,351 magazines published in the country.[475] These include: weekly news magazines *NIN*, *Vreme* and *Nedeljnik*; popular science magazine *Politikin Zabavnik*; women's magazine *Lepota & Zdravlje*; auto magazine *SAT revija*; and IT magazine *Svet kompjutera*. In addition, there is a wide selection of Serbian editions of international magazines, such as *Cosmopolitan*, *Elle*, *Men's Health*, *National Geographic*, *Le Monde diplomatique*, *Playboy*, and *Hello!*, among others.\n\n\nThe main news agencies are Tanjug, Beta and Fonet.\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], out of 432 web-portals (mainly on the .rs domain)[478] the most visited are online editions of printed dailies Blic and Kurir, news web-portal B92 and classifieds KupujemProdajem.[479]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Serbian cuisine\n\n![](image)A Serbian Christmas meal with roast pork, Russian salad and red wine.\n![](image)Gibanica, a Serbian pastry usually made with cottage cheese and eggs.\nSerbian cuisine is largely heterogeneous in a way characteristic of the Balkans and, especially, the former Yugoslavia. It features foods characteristic of lands formerly under Turkish suzerainty as well as cuisine originating from other parts of Central Europe (especially Austria and Hungary). Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days i.e. slava.[480]\n\n\nStaples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Bread plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and salt to guests. Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. The southern Serbian city of Leskovac is host to Roštiljijada, a yearly grilled meat barbecue-based festival that is considered the biggest barbecue festival in the Balkans.[481]\n\n\nOther Serbian specialties include ćevapčići (grilled and seasoned caseless sausages made from minced meat), pljeskavica (grilled spiced meat patty made from a mixture of pork, beef and lamb), gibanica (cheese pie), burek (baked pastry made from a thin flaky dough that is stuffed with meat, cheese or vegetables), sarma (stuffed cabbage), punjena paprika (stuffed pepper), moussaka (casserole made from minced meat, eggs, and potatoes), Karađorđeva šnicla (veal or pork schnitzel that is stuffed with kajmak), đuveč (meat and vegetable stew), pasulj (bean soup), podvarak (roast meat with sauerkraut), ajvar (roasted red pepper spread), kajmak (dairy product similar to clotted cream), čvarci (variant of pork rinds), proja (cornbread) and kačamak (corn-flour porridge).[482]\n\n\nSerbians claim their country as the birthplace of rakia (*rakija*), a highly alcoholic drink primarily distilled from fruit. Rakia in various forms is found throughout the Balkans, notably in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Hungary and Turkey. Slivovitz (*šljivovica*), a plum brandy, is a type of rakia which is considered the national drink of Serbia.[483] In 2021, Serbia's sljivovica was added to the United Nations Intangible Cultural Heritage List as a \"cherished tradition to be preserved by humanity\".[484]\n\n\nWinemaking traditions in Serbia dates back to Roman times.[485] Serbian wines are produced in 22 different geographical regions, with white wine dominating the total amount.[486] Besides rakia and wine, beer is a very popular alcoholic beverage in the country.[487] Pale lagers are currently and have been the traditional beer choice for Serbians. Meanwhile, dark lagers, while still being popular, are produced and consumed in much smaller quantities.[488] The most popular domestic brands of beer are Jelen, followed by Lav, which are both pale lagers.[489][490][491]\n\n\nAs in the rest of the former Yugoslavia, coffee drinking is an important cultural and social practice and Serbian coffee (a local variant of Turkish coffee) is the most commonly consumed non-alcoholic beverage in Serbia.[492]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Serbia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTennis player Novak Djokovic (left), who has won an all-time record of 24 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record ten Australian Open titles. Nikola Jokić (right), two-time NBA MVP, five-time NBA All-Star, 2023 NBA champion and Finals MVP.\n\nSports play an important role in Serbian society, and the country has a strong sporting history. The most popular sports in Serbia are football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, water polo and handball.\n\n\nProfessional sports in Serbia are organised by sporting federations and leagues (in the case of team sports). One of the particularities of Serbian professional sports is the existence of many multi-sport clubs (called \"sports societies\"), the biggest and most successful of which are Red Star, Partizan, and Beograd in Belgrade; Vojvodina in Novi Sad; Radnički in Kragujevac; and Spartak in Subotica.\n\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Serbia, and the Football Association of Serbia with 146,845 registered players, is the largest sporting association in the country.[493] Dragan Džajić was officially recognised as \"the best Serbian player of all time\" by the Football Association of Serbia, and more recently the likes of Nemanja Vidić, Dejan Stanković, Branislav Ivanović, Aleksandar Kolarov and Nemanja Matić play for the elite European clubs, developing the nation's reputation as one of the world's biggest exporters of footballers.[494][495] The Serbia national football team lacks relative success although it qualified for three of the last four FIFA World Cups. The two main football clubs in Serbia are Red Star (winner of the 1991 European Cup) and Partizan (a finalist at the 1966 European Cup), both from Belgrade. The rivalry between the two clubs is known as the \"Eternal Derby\", and is often cited as one of the most exciting sports rivalries in the world.[496]\n\n\nSerbia is one of the traditional powerhouses of world basketball,[497][498] as Serbia men's national basketball team have won two World Championships (in 1998 and 2002), three European Championships (1995, 1997, and 2001) and two Olympic silver medals (in 1996 and 2016) as well. The women's national basketball team have won two European Championships (2015, 2021) and an Olympic bronze medal in 2016. A total of 31 Serbian players have played in the NBA in the last three decades, including Nikola Jokić (2020–21, 2021–22 NBA MVP, 2023 NBA champion, 2023 NBA Finals MVP and five-time NBA All-Star), Predrag \"Peja\" Stojaković (2011 NBA champion and three-time NBA All-Star), and Vlade Divac (2001 NBA All-Star and Basketball Hall of Famer).[499] The renowned \"Serbian coaching school\" produced many of the most successful European basketball coaches of all time, such as Željko Obradović (who won a record 9 Euroleague titles as a coach), Dušan Ivković, Svetislav Pešić, and Igor Kokoškov (the first coach born and raised outside of North America to be hired as a head coach in the NBA). KK Partizan basketball club was the 1992 European champion.\n\n\nThe Serbia men's national water polo team is one of the most successful national teams, having won an Olympic gold medal in 2016 and 2020, three World Championships (2005, 2009 and 2015), and seven European Championships (2001, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018).[500] VK Partizan has won a joint-record seven European champion titles.\n\n\nThe recent success of Serbian tennis players has led to an immense growth in the popularity of tennis in the country. Novak Djokovic has won an all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles and has held the No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record duration. He became the eighth player in history to achieve the Career Grand Slam, the third man to hold all four major titles at once, the first ever to do so on three different surfaces,[501] and the first ever to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam. Ana Ivanovic (champion of 2008 French Open) and Jelena Janković were both ranked No. 1 in the WTA rankings. There were two No. 1 ranked-tennis double players as well: Nenad Zimonjić (three-time men's double and four-time mixed double Grand Slam champion) and Slobodan Živojinović. The Serbia men's tennis national team won the 2010 Davis Cup and 2020 ATP Cup, while Serbia women's tennis national team reached the final at 2012 Fed Cup.[502]\n\n\n\n![](image)Serbia men's national water polo team held Olympic Games, World Championship, European Championship, World Cup and World League titles simultaneously in period from 2014 to 2016.\nSerbia is one of the leading volleyball countries in the world. Its men's national team won the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics, the European Championship three times, as well as the 2016 FIVB World League. The women's national volleyball team are current world Champions, have won European Championship three times (2011, 2017 and 2019), as well as an Olympic silver medal in 2016.\n\n\nJasna Šekarić, sport shooter, is one of the athletes with the most appearances at the Olympic Games. She has won a total of five Olympic medals and three World Championship gold medals. Other noted Serbian athletes include: swimmers Milorad Čavić (2009 World championships gold and silver medalist as well as 2008 Olympic silver medalist on 100-metre butterfly in historic race with American swimmer Michael Phelps) and Nađa Higl (2009 World champion in 200-metre breaststroke); track and field athletes Vera Nikolić (former world record holder in 800 metres) and Ivana Španović (long-jumper; four-time European champion, World indoor champion and bronze medalist at the 2016 Olympics); wrestler Davor Štefanek (2016 Olympic gold medalist and 2014 World champion), and taekwondoist Milica Mandić (2012 Olympic gold medalist and 2017 world champion).\n\n\nSerbia has hosted several major sport competitions, including the 2005 Men's European Basketball Championship, 2005 Men's European Volleyball Championship, 2006 and 2016 Men's European Water Polo Championships, 2009 Summer Universiade, 2012 European Men's Handball Championship, and 2013 World Women's Handball Championship. The most important annual sporting events held in the country are the Belgrade Marathon and the Tour de Serbie cycling race.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Index of Serbia-related articles\n* Outline of Serbia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Recognised as minority languages:  \n Hungarian, Bosnian, Albanian, Croatian, Slovak, Romanian, Bulgarian, Rusyn and Macedonian\n2. **^** The area of Serbia including border disputes with Croatia is 88,499 square kilometers [2]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Excludes data for Kosovo.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mother tongue, religion and ethnic affiliation\". *ABOUT CENSUS*.
