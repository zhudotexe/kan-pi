The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves. The firm is headquartered at 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building at 270 Park Avenue in 2025.\n\n\nThe firm's early history can be traced to 1799, with the founding of what became the Chase Manhattan Company. In 1871, J.P. Morgan & Co. was founded by J. P. Morgan who launched the House of Morgan on 23 Wall Street as a national purveyor of commercial, investment, and private banking services. The present company was formed after the two predecessor firms merged in 2000, creating a diversified holding entity. It is a major provider of investment banking services, through corporate advisory, mergers and acquisitions, sales and trading, and public offerings. Their private banking franchise and asset management division are among the world's largest in terms of total assets. Its retail banking and credit card offerings are provided via the Chase brand in the U.S. and United Kingdom.\n\n\nWith US $3.9\u00a0trillion in total assets,[8] JPMorgan Chase is the fifth-largest bank in the world by assets. The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The JPMorgan Chase logo prior to the 2008 rebranding\n![](image)As of June 2008, the JPMorgan logo used for the company's Investment Banking, Asset Management, and Treasury & Securities Services units[11]\nJPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies that merged since 1996, combining Chase Manhattan Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., and Bank One, as well as asset assumptions of Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and First Republic. Predecessors include additional historic, major banking firms, among which are Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago Bank, National Bank of Detroit, Texas Commerce Bank, Providian Financial and Great Western Bank. The company's oldest predecessor institution, The Bank of the Manhattan Company, was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799, by Aaron Burr.[12]\n\n\n\n### Chase Manhattan Bank[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chase Manhattan Bank\n\n![](image)The logo used by Chase following the merger with the Manhattan Bank in 1954\nThe Chase Manhattan Bank was formed upon the 1955 purchase of Chase National Bank (established in 1877) by The Bank of the Manhattan Company (established in 1799),[13] the company's oldest predecessor institution. The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of Aaron Burr, who transformed the company from a water carrier into a bank.[14]\n\n\nAccording to page 115 of *An Empire of Wealth* by John Steele Gordon, the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase's history runs as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> At the turn of the nineteenth century, obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature. This, of course, injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. Hamilton's political enemy\u2014and eventual murderer\u2014Aaron Burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called The Manhattan Company to provide clean water to New York City. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States.[15]\n> \n> \n\n\nLed by David Rockefeller during the 1970s and 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banks, with leadership positions in syndicated lending, treasury and securities services, credit cards, mortgages, and retail financial services. Weakened by the real estate collapse in the early 1990s, it was acquired by Chemical Bank in 1996, retaining the Chase name.[16][17] Before its merger with J.P. Morgan & Co., the new Chase expanded the investment and asset management groups through two acquisitions. In 1999, it acquired San Francisco\u2013based Hambrecht & Quist for $1.35\u00a0billion.[18] In April 2000, UK-based Robert Fleming & Co. was purchased by the new Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7\u00a0billion.[19]\n\n\n\n### Chemical Banking Corporation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chemical Bank\n\nThe New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of various chemicals. In 1824, the company amended its charter to perform banking activities and created the Chemical Bank of New York. After 1851, the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, most notably with Corn Exchange Bank in 1954, Texas Commerce Bank (a large bank in Texas) in 1986, and Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company in 1991 (the first major bank merger \"among equals\"). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions. In 1984, Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity transactions alongside various financial sponsors. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of the pioneering investment banker, Jimmy Lee.[20][21] At many points throughout this history, Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of assets or deposit market share).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1996, Chemical Bank acquired Chase Manhattan. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, it took the better-known Chase name.[16][17] To this day, JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical's pre-1996 stock price history, as well as Chemical's former headquarters site at 270 Park Avenue (the current building was demolished and a larger replacement headquarters is being built on the same site).\n\n\n\n### J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: J.P. Morgan & Co.\n\n![](image)The J.P. Morgan & Co. logo before its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000\n![](image)Influence of J.P. Morgan in Large Corporations, 1914\n![](image)The J.P. Morgan headquarters in New York City following the September 16, 1920, bomb explosion that took the lives of 38 people and injured over 400 more\nThe House of Morgan was born out of the partnership of Drexel, Morgan & Co., which in 1895 was renamed J.P. Morgan & Co. (see also: J. Pierpont Morgan).[22] J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion dollar corporation.[23] In 1895, J.P. Morgan & Co. supplied the United States government with $62\u00a0million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100\u00a0million.[24] In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.[25]\n\n\nBuilt in 1914, 23 Wall Street was the bank's headquarters for decades.[26] On September 16, 1920, a terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank, injuring 400 and killing 38.[27] Shortly before the bomb went off, a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The case has never been solved, and was rendered inactive by the FBI in 1940.[28]\n\n\nIn August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the monopoly underwriter of war bonds for the UK and France. The Bank of England became a \"fiscal agent\" of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa.[29] The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France. The company profited from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.[29] Since the U.S. federal government withdrew from world affairs under successive isolationist Republican administrations in the 1920s, J.P. Morgan & Co. continued playing a major role in global affairs since most European countries still owed war debts.[30]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, J.P. Morgan & Co. and all integrated banking businesses in the United States were required by the provisions of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act to separate their investment banking from their commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank.[31]\n\n\nIn 1935, after being barred from the securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan spun off its investment-banking operations. Led by J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, Morgan Stanley was founded on September 16, 1935, with $6.6\u00a0million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners.[*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.[22] The bank would continue to operate as Morgan Guaranty Trust until the 1980s, before migrating back to the use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1984, the group purchased the Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette, Indiana. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.[32]\n\n\nThe Bank began operations in Japan in 1924,[33] in Australia during the later part of the nineteenth century,[34] and in Indonesia during the early 1920s.[35] An office of the Equitable Eastern Banking Corporation (one of J.P. Morgan's predecessors) opened a branch in China in 1921 and Chase National Bank was established there in 1923.[36] The bank has operated in Saudi Arabia[37] and India[38] since the 1930s. Chase Manhattan Bank opened an office in South Korea in 1967.[39] The firm's presence in Greece dates to 1968.[40] An office of JPMorgan was opened in Taiwan in 1970,[41] in Russia (Soviet Union) in 1973,[42] and Nordic operations began during the same year.[43] Operations in Poland began in 1995.[40]\n\n\n\n### Bank One Corporation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bank One Corporation\n\n![](image)Logo of Bank One\nIn 2004, JPMorgan Chase merged with Chicago-based Bank One Corp., bringing on board current chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon as president and COO.[44] He succeeded former CEO William B. Harrison Jr.[45] Dimon introduced new cost-cutting strategies, and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executives\u2014many of whom were with Dimon at Citigroup. Dimon became CEO in December 2005 and chairman in December 2006.[46] Bank One Corporation was formed with the 1998 merger of Banc One of Columbus, Ohio and First Chicago NBD.[47] This merger was considered a failure until Dimon took over and reformed the new firm's practices. Dimon effected changes to make Bank One Corporation a viable merger partner for JPMorgan Chase.[48]\n\n\nBank One Corporation, formerly First Bancgroup of Ohio, was founded as a holding company for City National Bank of Columbus, Ohio, and several other banks in that state, all of which were renamed \"Bank One\" when the holding company was renamed Banc One Corporation.[49] With the beginning of interstate banking they spread into other states, always renaming acquired banks \"Bank One.\" After the First Chicago NBD merger, adverse financial results led to the departure of CEO John B. McCoy, whose father and grandfather had headed Banc One and predecessors. JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of Bank One in the third quarter of 2004.[49]\n\n\n\n### Bear Stearns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bear Stearns\n\n![](image)The Bear Stearns logo\nAt the end of 2007, Bear Stearns was the fifth largest investment bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of the year.[50] On Friday, March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns lost 47% of its equity market value as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend, it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove insolvent, and on March 15, 2008, the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns.[51]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2008, after a weekend of intense negotiations between JPMorgan, Bear, and the federal government, JPMorgan Chase announced its plans to acquire Bear Stearns in a stock swap worth $2.00 per share or $240\u00a0million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days.[51] In the interim, JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all Bear Stearns trades and business process flows.[52] On March 18, 2008, JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of Bear Stearns for $236\u00a0million.[50] The stock swap agreement was signed that night.[53]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2008, after public discontent over the low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share.[50] Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns using newly issued shares at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board, representing another 10% of the share capital, that its members would vote in favor of the new deal. With sufficient commitments to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on May 30, 2008.[54]\n\n\n\n### Washington Mutual[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Washington Mutual\n\n![](image)The Washington Mutual logo prior to its 2008 acquisition by JPMorgan Chase\nOn September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most of the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That night, the Office of Thrift Supervision, in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations, and deposits to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $1.836\u00a0billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. \n\n\nHowever, Chase did not purchase any mortgages in the FDIC receivership as the loans had already been sold off into Washington Mutual-branded mortgage-backed securities long before the receivership happened on September 25, 2008. If Chase wanted ownership of any Washington Mutual mortgages, they had to purchase them from the FDIC by way of a Receiver's Deed or Bill of Sale. This could not occur, as there were no mortgages on Washington Mutual Bank's books at time of receivership. Any recorded Assignments of Mortgage claiming that Chase was \"successor in interest\" and that the transfer occurred \"by operation of law,\" would be incorrect. The FDIC was \"successor in interest\" to Washington Mutual Bank. Chase's purchase of the bank from the FDIC was for Washington Mutual Bank only and it occurred by a Purchase & Assumption Agreement[55] and not \"by operation of law\" from the receivership.\n\n\nAs a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their equity.[56]\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase raised $10\u00a0billion in a stock sale to cover writedowns and losses after taking on deposits and branches of Washington Mutual.[57] Through the acquisition, JPMorgan now owns the former accounts of Providian Financial, a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005. The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009.[*citation needed*] Chief executive Alan H. Fishman received a $7.5\u00a0million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6\u00a0million after being CEO for 17 days.[58][*importance?*]\n\n\n\n### First Republic Bank[edit]\n\n\nMain article: First Republic Bank\n\nOn May 1, 2023, in what was now the second largest bank failure behind JPMorgan's acquisition of Washington Mutual fifteen years earlier, the company acquired \"the substantial majority of assets\" and inherited the deposits of First Republic Bank. Under terms disclosed by JPMorgan Chase & Co., it will make a $10.6 billion payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, return $25 billion in funds that other banks deposited with First Republic in March in a lifeline negotiated with the US Department of Treasury at that time, and will eliminate a $5 billion deposit it had made with First Republic.[59] As a result of the takeover, First Republic Bank shareholders lost all their equity.\n\n\nThe FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be about $13 billion.[60]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans, previously known as Chase Education Finance.[61]\n\n\nIn April 2006, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bank of New York Mellon's retail and small business banking network. The acquisition gave Chase access to 339 additional branches in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.[62] In 2008, J.P. Morgan acquired the UK-based carbon offsetting company ClimateCare.[63] JPMorgan Chase was the biggest bank at the end of 2008 as an individual bank (exclusive of its subsidiaries) during the 2008 financial crisis.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 2008\u20132009[edit]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2008, $25 billion in funds were transferred from the U.S. Treasury Department to JPMorgan Chase, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[65] This was the fifth largest amount transferred under Section A of TARP[66] to help troubled assets related to residential mortgages. It has been widely reported[67] that JPMorgan Chase was in much better financial shape than other banks and did not need TARP funds but accepted the funds because the government did not want to single out only the banks with capital issues. JPMorgan Chase stated in February 2009 that it would be using its capital-base monetary strength to acquire new businesses.[68]\n\n\nBy February 2009, the U.S. government had not moved forward in enforcing TARP's intent of funding JPMorgan Chase with $25 billion.[65] In the face of the government's lack of action, Jamie Dimon was quoted during the week of February 1, 2009, as saying:\n\n\n\n\n> JPMorgan would be fine if we stopped talking about the damn nationalization of banks. We've got plenty of capital. To policymakers, I say where were they?\u00a0... They approved all these banks. Now they're beating up on everyone, saying look at all these mistakes, and we're going to come and fix it.[69][70]\n> \n> \n\n\nJPMorgan Chase was arguably the healthiest of the nine largest U.S. banks and did not need to take TARP funds. In order to encourage smaller banks with troubled assets to accept this money, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson allegedly coerced the CEOs of the nine largest banks to accept TARP money under short notice.[71]\n\n\nIn November 2009, J.P. Morgan announced it would acquire the balance of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, an advisory and underwriting joint venture established in 2004 with the Cazenove Group.[72] Earlier in 2011, the company announced that by the use of field-programmable gate array-based supercomputers, the time taken to assess risk had been greatly reduced, from arriving at a conclusion within hours to what is now minutes.[73] In 2013, J.P. Morgan acquired Bloomspot, a San Francisco-based startup. Shortly after the acquisition, the service was shut down and Bloomspot's talent was left unused.[74][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2013[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, after teaming up with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline and Children's Investment Fund, JPMorgan Chase, under Dimon launched a $94 Million fund with a focus on \"late-stage healthcare technology trials\". The \"$94 million Global Health Investment Fund will give money to final-stage drug, vaccine, and medical device studies that are otherwise stalled at companies because of their relatively high failure risk and low consumer demand. Examples of problems that could be addressed by the fund include malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and maternal and infant mortality, according to the Gates and JPMorgan Chase led-group\".[76]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nThe 2014 JPMorgan Chase data breach, disclosed in September 2014, compromised the JPMorgan Chase accounts of over 83 million customers. The attack was discovered by the bank's security team in late July 2014, but not completely halted until the middle of August.[77][78]\n\n\nIn October 2014, J.P. Morgan sold its commodities trader unit to Mercuria for $800 million, a quarter of the initial valuation of $3.5 billion, as the transaction excluded some oil and metal stockpiles and other assets.[79]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2016, J.P. Morgan decided not to finance coal mines and coal power plants in wealthy countries.[80] In December 2016, 14 former executives of the Wendel investment company faced trial for tax fraud while JPMorgan Chase was to be pursued for complicity. Jean-Bernard Lafonta was convicted December 2015 for spreading false information and insider trading, and fined 1.5 million euros.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Lawrence Obracanik, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. employee, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that he stole more than $5 million from his employer to pay personal debts.[82] In June 2017, Matt Zames, then-COO of the bank, decided to leave the firm.[83] In December 2017, J.P. Morgan was sued by the Nigerian government for $875 million, which Nigeria alleges was transferred by J.P. Morgan to a corrupt former minister.[84] Nigeria accused J.P. Morgan of being \"grossly negligent\".[85]\n\n\n\n#### 2019[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, J.P. Morgan announced the launch of JPM Coin, a digital token that will be used to settle transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business.[86] It would be the first cryptocurrency issued by a United States bank.[87]\n\n\n\n#### 2021[edit]\n\n\nOn April 19, 2021, JP Morgan pledged $5\u00a0billion towards the European Super League.[88][89] a controversial breakaway group of football clubs seeking to create a monopolistic structure where the founding members would be guaranteed entry to the competition in perpetuity. They funded the failed attempt to create the league, which, if successful, would have ended the meritocratic European pyramid soccer system. J.P. Morgan's role in the creation of the Super League was instrumental; the investment bank was reported to have worked on it for several years.[90] After a strong backlash, the owners/management of the teams that proposed creating the league pulled out of it.[91] After the attempt to end the European football hierarchy failed, J.P. Morgan apologized for its role in the scheme.[90] JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the company \"kind of missed\" that football supporters would respond negatively to the Super League.[92] While the absence of promotion and relegation is a common sports model in the US, this is an antithesis to the European competition-based pyramid model and has led to widespread condemnation from Football federations internationally as well as at government level.[93] However, even at the time, JPMorgan had been involved in European football for almost 20 years. In 2003, they advised the Glazer ownership of Manchester United. It also advised Rocco Commisso, the owner of Mediacom, to purchase ACF Fiorentina, and Dan Friedkin on his takeover of A.S. Roma. Moreover, It aided Inter Milan and A.S. Roma to sell bonds backed by future media revenue, and Spain's Real Madrid CF to raise funds to refurbish their Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.[94]\n\n\nIn September 2021, JPMorgan Chase entered the UK retail banking market by launched an app-based current account under the Chase brand. This is the company's first retail banking operation outside of the United States.[95][96][97] In 2021, the company made more than over 30 acquisitions including OpenInvest and Nutmeg.[98][99] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that would acquire Global Shares, a cloud-based provider of share plan software management.[100][101] In November 2021, JPMorgan Chase acquired restaurant recommendation website and owner of Zagat, The Infatuation.[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, JPMorgan Chase was ranked 24 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue.[104] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced to wind down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.[105]\n\n\nOn May 20, 2022, JPMorgan Chase used blockchain for collateral settlements, the latest Wall Street experimentation with the technology in the trading of traditional financial assets.[106]\n\n\nIn September 2022, the company announced it was acquiring California-based Renovite Technologies to expand its payments processing business amid heavy competition from fintech firms like Stripe and Adyen. This comes on top of previous, similar moves of buying a 49% stake in fintech Viva Wallet and a majority sake in Volkswagen's payments business, among many other acquisitions in other areas of finance.[107][108][109]\n\n\nIn November 2022, JPMorgan Chase sent COO Daniel Pinto to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong.[110] The attendance of US financial executives drew heavy criticism from some US lawmakers, who had previously urged the US financial executives to cancel their attendance to the summit.[111][112]\n\n\n\n#### 2023[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2023, *CNBC* reported JPMorgan Chase was developing a new tool for investment advisers using artificial intelligence called IndexGPT. Via trademark filing, this would rely on a \"disruptive form of artificial intelligence\" and cloud computing software to select investments for customers. This move was a sign the bank intended to launch a product in the near term, given the requirements around filing, and it came amid a flurry of development around ChatGPT and this technology from financial institutions. This came amid a period of job cuts, including for technology roles, even as the company emphasize its commitment to AI and created a model to detect potential changes in Federal Reserve policy.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and legal settlements by years[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### 2001[edit]\n\n\nChase paid out over $2\u00a0billion in fines and legal settlements for their role in financing Enron Corporation with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.'s securities fraud, which collapsed amid a financial scandal in 2001.[117] In 2003, Chase paid $160\u00a0million in fines and penalties to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan district attorney's office. In 2005, Chase paid $2.2\u00a0billion to settle a lawsuit filed by investors in Enron.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2002[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2002, Chase paid fines totaling $80\u00a0million, with the amount split between the states and the federal government. The fines were part of a settlement involving charges that ten banks, including Chase, deceived investors with biased research. The total settlement with the ten banks was $1.4\u00a0billion. The settlement required that the banks separate investment banking from research, and ban any allocation of IPO shares.[119]\n\n\n\n### 2005[edit]\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase, which helped underwrite $15.4\u00a0billion of WorldCom's bonds, agreed in March 2005 to pay $2\u00a0billion; that was 46 percent, or $630\u00a0million, more than it would have paid had it accepted an investor offer in May 2004 of $1.37\u00a0billion. J.P. Morgan was the last big lender to settle. Its payment is the second largest in the case, exceeded only by the $2.6\u00a0billion accord reached in 2004 by Citigroup.[120] In March 2005, 16 of WorldCom's 17 former underwriters reached settlements with the investors.[121][122] In 2005, JPMorgan Chase acknowledged that its two predecessor banks had received ownership of thousands of slaves as collateral prior to the Civil War. The company apologized for contributing to the \"brutal and unjust institution\" of slavery.[123][124] The bank paid $5 million in reparations in the form of a scholarship program for Black students.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n### 2009[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, 14 lawsuits were filed against JPMorgan Chase in various district courts on behalf of Chase credit card holders claiming the bank violated the Truth in Lending Act, breached its contract with the consumers, and committed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The consumers contended that Chase, with little or no notice, increased minimum monthly payments from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based on the promise of a fixed interest rate. In May 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.[128]\n\n\nIn November 2009, a week after Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Larry Langford was convicted for financial crimes related to bond swaps for Jefferson County, Alabama,[*importance?*] JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to a $722\u00a0million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe into the sales of derivatives that allegedly contributed to the near-bankruptcy of the county. JPMorgan had been chosen by the county commissioners to refinance the county's sewer debt, and the SEC had alleged that JPMorgan made undisclosed payments to close friends of the commissioners in exchange for the deal and made up for the costs by charging higher interest rates on the swaps.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2010[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, J.P. Morgan Securities was fined a record \u00a333.32\u00a0million ($49.12\u00a0million) by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) for failing to protect an average of \u00a35.5\u00a0billion of clients' money from 2002 to 2009.[130][131] FSA requires financial firms to keep clients' funds in separate accounts to protect the clients in case such a firm becomes insolvent. The firm had failed to properly segregate client funds from corporate funds following the merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan, resulting in a violation of FSA regulations but no losses to clients. The clients' funds would have been at risk had the firm become insolvent during this period.[132] J.P. Morgan Securities reported the incident to the FSA, corrected the errors, and cooperated in the ensuing investigation, resulting in the fine being reduced 30% from an original amount of \u00a347.6\u00a0million.[131]\n\n\n\n### 2011[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, JPMorgan Chase admitted that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed on more than a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active-duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was \"grim\" and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back.[133] Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27\u00a0million in compensation to settle the class-action suit.[134] At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed. In June 2011, lending chief Dave Lowman was forced out over the scandal.[135][136]\n\n\nOn August 25, 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to settle fines with regard to violations of the sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regime.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] The U.S. Department of Treasury released the following civil penalties information under the heading: \"JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Settles Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs\":[*importance?*]\n\n\n\n\n> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, New York, NY (\"JPMC\") has agreed to remit $88,300,000 to settle a potential civil liability for apparent violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (\"CACR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 515; the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations (\"WMDPSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 544; Executive Order 13382, \"Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters;\" the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (\"GTSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 594; the Iranian Transactions Regulations (\"ITR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 560; the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations (\"SSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 538; the Former Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor Sanctions Regulations (\"FLRCTSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 593; and the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations (\"RPPR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 501, that occurred between December 15, 2005, and March 1, 2011.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aU.S. Department of the Treasury Resource Center, OFAC Recent Actions. Retrieved June 18, 2013.[137]\n> \n\n\n### 2012[edit]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[138] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[139] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.\n\n\nIn 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co was charged for misrepresenting and failing to disclose that the CIO had engaged in speculative trades that exposed JPMorgan to significant losses.[140]\n\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2013, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a stipulation and consent agreement under which JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation (JPMVEC), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to pay $410 million in penalties and disgorgement to ratepayers for allegations of market manipulation stemming from the company's bidding activities in electricity markets in California and the Midwest from September 2010 through November 2012.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] JPMVEC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $285 million to the U.S. Treasury and to disgorge $125 million in unjust profits. JPMVEC admitted the facts set forth in the agreement, but neither admitted nor denied the violations.[141] The case stemmed from multiple referrals to FERC from market monitors in 2011 and 2012 regarding JPMVEC's bidding practices. FERC investigators determined that JPMVEC engaged in 12 manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants that were usually out of the money in the marketplace. In each of them, the company made bids designed to create artificial conditions that forced California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (ISOs) to pay JPMVEC outside the market at premium rates.[141] FERC investigators further determined that JPMVEC knew that the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO received no benefit from making inflated payments to the company, thereby defrauding the ISOs by obtaining payments for benefits that the company did not deliver beyond the routine provision of energy. FERC investigators also determined that JPMVEC's bids displaced other generation and altered day ahead and real-time prices from the prices that would have resulted had the company not submitted the bids.[141] Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed FERC to detect, prevent, and appropriately sanction the gaming of energy markets. According to FERC, the Commission approved the settlement as in the public interest.[141]\n\n\nFERC's investigation of energy market manipulations led to a subsequent investigation into possible obstruction of justice by employees of JPMorgan Chase.[142] Various newspapers reported in September 2013 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Attorney's Office in Manhattan were investigating whether employees withheld information or made false statements during the FERC investigation.[142] The reported impetus for the investigation was a letter from Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, in which they asked FERC why no action was taken against people who impeded the FERC investigation.[142] At the time of the FBI investigation, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was also looking into whether JPMorgan Chase employees impeded the FERC investigation.[142] Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase was facing over a dozen investigations at the time.[142]\n\n\nBernie Madoff opened a business account at Chemical Bank in 1986 and maintained it until 2008, long after Chemical acquired Chase.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] In 2010, Irving Picard, the SIPC receiver appointed to liquidate Madoff's company, alleged that JPMorgan Chase failed to prevent Madoff from defrauding his customers. According to the suit, Chase \"knew or should have known\" that Madoff's wealth management business was a fraud. However, Chase did not report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it notified the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency. Picard argued that even after Morgan's investment bankers reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, Chase's retail banking division did not put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.[143] The receiver's suit against JPMorgan Chase was dismissed by the Court for failing to set forth any legally cognizable claim for damages.[144] In the fall of 2013, JPMorgan Chase began talks with prosecutors and regulators regarding compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer banking regulations in connection with Madoff.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn August 2013, JPMorgan Chase announced that it was being investigated by the United States Department of Justice over its offerings of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. The company said that the Department of Justice had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during the period 2005 to 2007.[145] On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities.[146] Of that amount, $9 billion was penalties and fines, and the remaining $4 billion was consumer relief. This was the largest corporate settlement to date. Conduct at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to their 2008 acquisitions accounted for much of the alleged wrongdoing. The agreement did not settle criminal charges.[147]\n\n\n\n### 2014[edit]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2014, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $2.05 billion in fines and penalties to settle civil and criminal charges related to its role in the Madoff scandal.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] The government filed a two-count criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase with Bank Secrecy Act violations, but the charges would be dismissed within two years provided that JPMorgan Chase reforms its anti-money laundering procedures and cooperates with the government in its investigation. The bank agreed to forfeit $1.7 billion. The lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of shareholders against chief executive Jamie Dimon and other high-ranking JPMorgan Chase employees, used statements made by Bernie Madoff during interviews conducted while in prison in Butner, North Carolina claiming that JPMorgan Chase officials knew of the fraud. The lawsuit stated that \"JPMorgan was uniquely positioned for 20 years to see Madoff's crimes and put a stop to them ... But faced with the prospect of shutting down Madoff's account and losing lucrative profits, JPMorgan \u2013 at its highest level \u2013 chose to turn a blind eye.\"[148][*neutrality is disputed*] JPMorgan Chase also agreed to pay a $350 million fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and settle the suit filed against it by Picard for $543 million.[149][150][151][152]\n\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $264 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges involving a systematic bribery scheme spanning 2006 to 2013 in which the bank secured business deals in Hong Kong by agreeing to hire hundreds of friends and relatives of Chinese government officials, resulting in more than $100 million in revenue for the bank.[153]\n\n\n\n### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, the United States sued the company, accusing it of discriminating against \"thousands\" of black and Hispanic mortgage borrowers between 2006 and at least 2009.[154][155]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nOn December 26, 2018, as part of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into abusive practices related to American depositary receipts (ADRs), JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $135 million to settle charges of improper handling of \"pre-released\" ADRs without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. The sum consisted of $71 million in ill-gotten gains plus $14.4 million in prejudgment interest and an additional penalty of $49.7 million.[156]\n\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\nOn May 14, 2020, *Financial Times*, citing a report which revealed how companies are treating employees, their supply chains and other stakeholders, during the COVID-19 pandemic, documented that J.P. Morgan Asset Management alongside Fidelity Investments and Vanguard have been accused of paying lip services to cover human rights violations. The UK based media also referenced that a few of the world's biggest fund houses took the action in order to lessen the impact of abuses, such as modern slavery, at the companies they invest in. J.P. Morgan, in responding to the report, said that it took \"human rights violations very seriously\" and \"any company with alleged or proven violations of principles, including human rights abuses, is scrutinized and may result in either enhanced engagement or removal from a portfolio.\"[157]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the company admitted that it manipulated precious metals futures and government bond markets in a span period of eight years. It settled with the United States Department of Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for $920 million. J.P. Morgan will not face criminal charges, however, it will launch into a deferred prosecution agreement for three years.[158]\n\n\n\n### 2022\u20132023[edit]\n\n\nOn November 24, 2022, two women who accused Jeffrey Epstein of sex trafficking and sexual abuse also sued JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, accusing them of benefiting and closing their eyes to Epstein's sex trafficking operations. According to the lawsuits, banks knew that Epstein's accounts were used to finance sex trafficking crimes.[159][160] In June 2023, after the allegations reached class-action status, the parties reached a settlement, with JPMorgan agreeing to pay $290\u00a0million.[161]\n\n\nIn September 2023, JPMorgan agreed to a $75 million settlement with the United States Virgin Islands Department of Justice for its alleged facilitation and failure to notify law enforcement of Epstein's illegal activities.[162]\n\n\n\n## Financial data[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | 25.87 | 31.15 | 33.19 | 29.34 | 29.61 | 33.19 | 42.74 | 54.25 | 62.00 | 71.37 | 67.25 | 100.4 | 102.7 | 97.23 | 97.03 | 96.61 | 94.21 | 93.54 | 95.67 | 99.62 | 109.03 | 115.40 | 119.54 | 121.65 | 128.69\n |\n| Net income | 4.745 | 7.501 | 5.727 | 1.694 | 1.663 | 6.719 | 4.466 | 8.483 | 14.44 | 15.37 | 5.605 | 11.73 | 17.37 | 18.98 | 21.28 | 17.92 | 21.76 | 24.44 | 24.73 | 24.44 | 32.47 | 36.43 | 29.13 | 48.33 | 37.68\n |\n| Assets | 626.9 | 667.0 | 715.3 | 693.6 | 758.8 | 770.9 | 1,157 | 1,199 | 1,352 | 1,562 | 2,175 | 2,032 | 2,118 | 2,266 | 2,359 | 2,416 | 2,573 | 2,352 | 2,491 | 2,534 | 2,623 | 2,687 | 3,386 | 3,743 | 3,666\n |\n| Equity | 35.10 | 35.06 | 42.34 | 41.10 | 42.31 | 46.15 | 105.7 | 107.2 | 115.8 | 123.2 | 166.9 | 165.4 | 176.1 | 183.6 | 204.1 | 210.9 | 231.7 | 247.6 | 254.2 | 255.7 | 256.5 | 261.3 | 279.4 | 294.1 | 292.3\n |\n| Capitalization |  |  |  |  |  | 75.03 | 138.7 | 138.4 | 167.2 | 147.0 | 117.7 | 164.3 | 165.9 | 125.4 | 167.3 | 219.7 | 232.5 | 241.9 | 307.3 | 366.3 | 319.8 | 429.9 | 387.5 |  |  |\n| Headcount |  |  |  |  |  | 96.37 | 161.0 | 168.8 | 174.4 | 180.7 | 225.0 | 222.3 | 239.8 | 260.2 | 259.0 | 251.2 | 241.4 | 234.6 | 243.4 | 252.5 | 256.1 | 257.0 | 255.4 | 271.0 | 293.7\n |\n\n\n**Note**: Financial data in billions of US dollars and employee data in thousands.

In the United States, it owns and operates two key legal subsidiaries:[171]\n\n\n\n* Chase Bank\n* JPMorgan Securities, LLC.\n\n\nThe modern JPMorgan Chase is broken up into the following four business segments:[172]\n\n\n\n* Asset and Wealth Management (J.P. Morgan)\n* Consumer and Community Banking (Chase)\n* Corporate and Investment banking (J.P. Morgan)\n* Commercial Banking (Chase)\n\n\n### JPMorgan Europe, Ltd.[edit]\n\n\nMain article: J.P. Morgan in the United Kingdom\n\nThe company, known previously as Chase Manhattan International Limited, was founded on September 18, 1968.[173][174] In August 2008, the bank announced plans to construct a new European headquarters at Canary Wharf, London.[175] These plans were subsequently suspended in December 2010, when the bank announced the purchase of a nearby existing office tower at 25 Bank Street for use as the European headquarters of its investment bank.[176] 25 Bank Street had originally been designated as the European headquarters of Enron and was subsequently used as the headquarters of Lehman Brothers International.[*importance?*] The regional office is in London with offices in Bournemouth, Glasgow, and Edinburgh for asset management, private banking, and investment banking.[177]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition history[edit]\n\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, although this is not a comprehensive list:\n\n\n\n* JPMorgan\u00a0Chase & Co.\n\t+ JPMorgan Chase (merged\u00a02000)\n\t\t- Chase\u00a0Manhattan\u00a0Bank (merged\u00a01996)[178]\n\t\t\t* Chemical\u00a0Bank (merged\u00a01996)\n\t\t\t\t+ Chemical\u00a0Bank (reorganized\u00a01988)\n\t\t\t\t\t- The Chemical Bank of New York (est.\u00a01823)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Citizens National Bank (est. 1851, acq. 1920)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Corn Exchange Bank (est. 1852, acq. 1954)\n\t\t\t\t\t- New York Trust Company (acq. 1959)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Texas Commerce Bank (est. 1866, acq. 1986)[179]\n\t\t\t\t+ Manufacturers Hanover (merged\u00a01961)\n\t\t\t\t\t- Manufacturers Trust Company (est.\u00a01905)[180]\n\t\t\t\t\t- Hanover Bank (est. 1873)\n\t\t\t* Chase Manhattan\u00a0Bank (merged 1955)\n\t\t\t\t+ The Bank of the Manhattan Company (est. 1799)\n\t\t\t\t+ Chase National Bank of the City of New York (est. 1877)[181]\n\t\t- J.P.

JPMorgan's giving has been focused on Republicans, with 62 percent of its donations going to GOP recipients in 2014. 78 House Democrats received campaign cash from JPMorgan's PAC in the 2014 cycle at an average of $5,200 and a total of 38 of the Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill took money from JPMorgan's PAC in 2014. JPMorgan Chase's PAC made maximum donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the leadership PACs of Steny Hoyer and Jim Himes in 2014.[187]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that they had committed a five-year $20 million commitment in support of summer youth employment programs (SYEPs) across 24 cities in the United States. This commitment came as part of the organisations wider $30 billion commitment to drive inclusive economic recovery and increase opportunities for underserved communities. The latest commitment will place funds to local governments, employers, and community partners to aid in giving young people access to SYEPs and gain experience to help in building careers.[188]\n\n\n\n## Climate change[edit]\n\n\nJPMorgan has come under criticism for investing in new fossil fuels projects since the Paris climate change agreement. From 2016 to the first half of 2019 it provided $75 billion (\u00a361 billion) to companies expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration.[189] According to Rainforest Action Network its total fossil fuel financing was $64 billion in 2018, $69 billion in 2017 and $62 billion in 2016.[190] From 2015, which is when the Paris Agreement was adopted, until 2021, JP Morgan Chase provided $317 billion in fossil fuel financing; 33% more than any other bank.[191] On October 21, 2021, JP Morgan Chase joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance,[192] which supports \"the global transition of the real economy to net-zero emissions.\"[193]\n\n\nAn internal study, 'Risky business: the climate and macroeconomy', by bank economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray was leaked in early\u20112020.[*importance?*] The report, dated 14\u00a0January 2020, states that under our current unsustainable trajectory of climate change \"we cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened\". JPMorgan subsequently distanced itself from the content of the study.[194]\n\n\nIn May 2023, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would purchase $200 million in carbon credits representing 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from multiple companies (including Climeworks and Charm Industrial) after announcing the previous month that it would join the Frontier CDR initiative formed by Alphabet Inc., McKinsey & Company, Meta Platforms, Shopify, and Stripe, Inc. under a $925 million advance market commitment to the CDR industry the previous year.[list 1]\n\n\n\n## Offices[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the old Chase Manhattan Bank's headquarters were at One Chase Manhattan Plaza (now 28 Liberty Street) in Lower Manhattan, the current temporary world headquarters for JPMorgan Chase & Co. are located at 383 Madison Avenue. In 2018, JPMorgan announced they would demolish the current headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue, which was Union Carbide's former headquarters, to make way for a newer building at 270 Park Avenue that will be 681 feet (208\u00a0m) taller than the previous building. Demolition was completed in the spring of 2021, and the new building will be completed in 2025. The replacement 1,388 feet (423\u00a0m) and 70-story headquarters will contain 2,500,000 square feet (230,000\u00a0m2), and will be able to fit 15,000 employees, whereas the current building fits 6,000 employees in a space that has a capacity of 3,500. The new headquarters is part of the East Midtown rezoning plan.[201] When construction is completed in 2025, the headquarters will then move back into the new building at 270 Park Avenue. As the new headquarters is replaced, the bulk of North American operations take place in five nearby buildings on or near Park Avenue in New York City: the former Bear Stearns Building at 383 Madison Avenue (just south of 270 Park Avenue), the former Chemical Bank Building at 277 Park Avenue just to the east, 237 Park Avenue, and 390 Madison Avenue.\n\n\nApproximately 11,050 employees are located in Columbus at the McCoy Center, the former Bank One Corporation offices. The building is the largest JPMorgan Chase & Co. facility in the world and the second-largest single-tenant office building in the United States behind The Pentagon.[202] The bank moved some of its operations to the JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston, when it purchased Texas Commerce Bank.[*citation needed*] The Global Corporate Bank's main headquarters are in London, with regional headquarters in Hong Kong, New York and S\u00e3o Paulo.[203]\n\n\nThe Card Services division has its headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, with Card Services offices in Elgin, Illinois; Springfield, Missouri; San Antonio, Texas; Mumbai, India; and Cebu, Philippines. Additional large operation centers are located in Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California, Newark, Delaware; Orlando, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Jacksonville, Florida; Brandon, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Brooklyn, New York; Rochester, New York; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Plano, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Operation centers in Canada are located in Burlington, Ontario; and Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\nAdditional offices and technology operations are located in Manila, Philippines; Cebu, Philippines; Mumbai, India; Bangalore, India; Hyderabad, India; New Delhi, India; Buenos Aires, Argentina; S\u00e3o Paulo; Mexico City, Mexico, and Jerusalem, Israel. In late 2017, JPMorgan Chase opened a new global operations center in Warsaw, Poland.[204] The Asia Pacific headquarters for JPMorgan is located in Hong Kong at Chater House.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOperations centers in the United Kingdom are located in Bournemouth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Liverpool, and Swindon. The London location also serves as the European headquarters.\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Temporary World Headquarters 383 Madison Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Temporary World Headquarters  \n383 Madison Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![JPMorgan Chase World Headquarters (under construction) 270 Park Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase World Headquarters (under construction)  \n270 Park Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![277 Park Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\n277 Park Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![28 Liberty Street, New York City, New York](image)\n\n28 Liberty Street  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![Chase Tower Chicago, Illinois](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nChicago, Illinois\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Building San Francisco, California](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Building  \nSan Francisco, California\n* ![Chase Tower Dallas, Texas](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nDallas, Texas\n* ![Chase Tower Phoenix, Arizona](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nPhoenix, Arizona\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Tower Houston, Texas](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Tower  \nHouston, Texas\n* ![25 Bank Street London, United Kingdom](image)\n\n25 Bank Street  \nLondon, United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO.[205][206] As of 2013 JPMorgan had the largest credit default swap and credit derivatives portfolio by total notional amount of any US bank.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### 2012 CDS trading loss[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss\n\nIn April 2012, hedge fund insiders became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of Bruno Iksil, a trader for JPMorgan Chase & Co., referred to as \"the London whale\" in reference to the huge positions he was taking. Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of J.P. Morgan, who purchased the derivatives offered by J.P. Morgan in such high volume.[209][210] Early reports were denied and minimized by the firm in an attempt to minimize exposure.[211] Major losses, $2 billion, were reported by the firm in May 2012, in relation to these trades and updated to $4.4 billion on July 13, 2012.[212] The disclosure, which resulted in headlines in the media, did not disclose the exact nature of the trading involved, which remained in progress as of June 28, 2012, and continued to produce losses which could total as much as $9 billion under worst-case scenarios.[213][214] In the end, the trading produced actual losses of only $6 billion. The item traded, possibly related to CDX IG 9, an index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations,[215][216] has been described as a \"derivative of a derivative\".[217][218] On the company's emergency conference call, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the strategy was \"flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored\".[219] The episode was investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the FBI.[220]\n\n\n\n\n\nFines levied regarding the 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss[221]\n| Regulator | Nation | Fine\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Office of the Comptroller of the Currency | US | $300m\n |\n| Securities and Exchange Commission | $200m\n |\n| Federal Reserve | $200m\n |\n| Financial Conduct Authority | UK | \u00a3138m ($220m US)\n |\n\n\nOn September 18, 2013, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $920 million in fines and penalties to American and UK regulators for violations related to the trading loss and other incidents. The fine was part of a multiagency and multinational settlement with the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. The company also admitted breaking American securities law.[222] The fines amounted to the third biggest banking fine levied by US regulators, and the second-largest by UK authorities.[221] As of September\u00a019, 2013[update], two traders face criminal proceedings.[221] It is also the first time in several years that a major American financial institution has publicly admitted breaking the securities laws.[223]\n\n\nA report by the SEC was critical of the level of oversight from senior management on traders, and the FCA said the incident demonstrated \"flaws permeating all levels of the firm: from portfolio level right up to senior management.\"[221] On the day of the fine, the BBC reported from the New York Stock Exchange that the fines \"barely registered\" with traders there, the news had been an expected development, and the company had prepared for the financial hit.[221]\n\n\n\n## Art collection[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: J. P. Morgan \u00a7\u00a0Collector of art, books, and gemstones\n\nThe collection was begun in 1959 by David Rockefeller,[224] and comprises over 30,000 objects, of which over 6,000 are photographic-based,[225] as of 2012 containing more than one hundred works by Middle Eastern and North African artists.[226] The One Chase Manhattan Plaza building was the original location at the start of collection by the Chase Manhattan Bank, the current collection containing both this and also those works that the First National Bank of Chicago had acquired prior to assimilation into the JPMorgan Chase organization.[227] L. K. Erf has been the director of acquisitions of works since 2004 for the bank,[228] whose art program staff is completed by an additional three full-time members and one registrar.[229] The advisory committee at the time of the Rockefeller initiation included A. H. Barr, and D. Miller, and also J. J. Sweeney, R. Hale, P. Rathbone and G. Bunshaft.[230]\n\n\n\n## Major sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Chase Field (formerly Bank One Ballpark), Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks, MLB\n* Chase Center, San Francisco, California \u2013 Golden State Warriors, NBA\n* Major League Soccer\n* Chase Auditorium (formerly Bank One Auditorium) inside of Chase Tower in Chicago, Illinois (formerly Bank One Tower)\n* The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge, owned and operated by JPMorgan Chase, is the largest corporate road racing series in the world with over 200,000 participants in 12 cities in six countries on five continents.

The acquisition deal of Bank One in 2004, was designed in part to recruit Dimon to JPMorgan Chase. He became chief executive at the end of 2005.[231] Dimon has been recognized for his leadership during the 2008 financial crisis.[232] Under his leadership, JPMorgan Chase rescued two ailing banks during the crisis.[233]\n\n\nAlthough Dimon has publicly criticized the American government's strict immigration policies, as of July 2018, his company has $1.6 million worth of stocks in Sterling Construction (the company contracted to build a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border).[234][235][*neutrality is disputed*]\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of May 1, 2023:[236]\n\n\n\n* Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase\n* Linda Bammann, former JPMorgan and Bank One executive\n* Steve Burke, chairman of NBCUniversal\n* Todd Combs, CEO of GEICO\n* James Crown, president of Henry Crown and Company\n* Alicia Boler Davis, CEO of Alto Pharmacy\n* Timothy Flynn, former chairman and CEO of KPMG\n* Alex Gorsky, former CEO and chairman of Johnson & Johnson\n* Mellody Hobson, CEO of Ariel Investments\n* Michael Neal, CEO of GE Capital\n* Phebe Novakovic, chairwoman and CEO of General Dynamics\n* Virginia Rometty, Executive Chairwoman of IBM, former chairwoman, president and CEO of IBM\n\n\n### Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* Chairman: Jamie Dimon (since January 2007)[237]\n* Chief Executive: Jamie Dimon (since January 2006)[237]\n\n\n#### List of former chairmen[edit]\n\n\n1.

The bank was founded in San Francisco, California. It is the second-largest banking institution in the United States, after JPMorgan Chase, and the second-largest bank in the world by market capitalization. Bank of America is one of the Big Four banking institutions of the United States.[5] It serves approximately 10.73% of all American bank deposits, in direct competition with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Its primary financial services revolve around commercial banking, wealth management, and investment banking.\n\n\nOne branch of its history stretches back to the U.S.-based Bank of Italy, founded by Amadeo Pietro Giannini in 1904, which provided various banking options to Italian immigrants who faced service discrimination.[6] Originally headquartered in San Francisco, California, Giannini acquired Banca d'America e d'Italia (Bank of America and Italy) in 1922. The passage of landmark federal banking legislation facilitated a rapid growth in the 1950s, quickly establishing a prominent market share. After suffering a significant loss after the 1998 Russian bond default, BankAmerica, as it was then known, was acquired by the Charlotte-based NationsBank for US$62 billion. Following what was then the largest bank acquisition in history, the Bank of America Corporation was founded. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, it built upon its commercial banking business by establishing Merrill Lynch for wealth management and Bank of America Merrill Lynch for investment banking in 2008 and 2009, respectively (since renamed BofA Securities).[7]\n\n\nBoth Bank of America and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management retain large market shares in their respective offerings. The investment bank is considered within the \"Bulge Bracket\" as the third largest investment bank in the world, as of 2018[update].[8] Its wealth management side manages US$1.081 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as the second largest wealth manager in the world, after UBS.[9] In commercial banking, Bank of America operates\u2014but does not necessarily maintain\u2014retail branches in all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia and more than 40 other countries.[10] Its commercial banking footprint encapsulates 46 million consumer and small business relationships at 4,600 banking centers and 15,900 automated teller machines (ATMs).\n\n\nThe bank's large market share, business activities, and economic impact has led to numerous lawsuits and investigations regarding both mortgages and financial disclosures dating back to the 2008 financial crisis. Its corporate practices of servicing the middle class and wider banking community have yielded a substantial market share since the early 20th century. As of August\u00a02018[update], Bank of America has a $313.5 billion market capitalization, making it the 13th largest company in the world. As the sixth largest American public company, it garnered $102.98 billion in sales as of June\u00a02018[update].[11] Bank of America was ranked #25 on the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest US corporations by total revenue.[12] Likewise, Bank of America was also ranked #6 on the 2023 Global 2000 rankings done by Forbes.[13] Bank of America was named the \"World's Best Bank\" by the *Euromoney Institutional Investor* in its 2018 Awards for Excellence.[14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nBank of America, Los Angeles was founded in California in 1923. In 1928, this entity was acquired by Bank of Italy of San Francisco, which took the Bank of America name two years later.[16]\n\n\nThe eastern portion of the Bank of America franchise can be traced to 1784, when Massachusetts Bank was chartered, the first federally chartered joint-stock owned bank in the United States and only the second bank to receive a charter in the United States. This bank became FleetBoston, with which Bank of America merged in 2004. In 1874, Commercial National Bank was founded in Charlotte. That bank merged with American Trust Company in 1958 to form American Commercial Bank.[17] Two years later it became North Carolina National Bank when it merged with Security National Bank of Greensboro. In 1991, it merged with C&S/Sovran Corporation of Atlanta and Norfolk to form NationsBank.\n\n\nThe central portion of the franchise dates to 1910, when Commercial National Bank and Continental National Bank of Chicago merged in 1910 to form Continental & Commercial National Bank, which evolved into Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust.\n\n\n\n### Bank of Italy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bank of Italy (United States)\n\n![](image)Amadeo Giannini, 1927\nThe history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini (1870\u20131949) founded the Bank of Italy, in San Francisco.[16] In 1922, Bank of America, Los Angeles was established with Giannini as a minority investor. The two banks merged in 1928 and consolidated with other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country.[18]\n\n\nIn 1918, another corporation, Bancitaly Corporation, was organized by A. P. Giannini, the largest stockholder of which was Stockholders Auxiliary Corporation.[*citation needed*] This company acquired the stocks of various banks located in New York City and certain foreign countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1928, Giannini merged his bank with Bank of America, Los Angeles, headed by Orra E. Monnette. Bank of Italy was renamed on November 3, 1930, to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association,[19] which was the only such designated bank in the United States at that time. Giannini and Monnette headed the resulting company, serving as co-chairs.[20]\n\n\n\n### Expansion in California[edit]\n\n\n![Early Bank of America building](image)Entrance to the Bank of America, San Francisco, California, 1943\nGiannini introduced branch banking shortly after 1909 legislation in California allowed for branch banking in the state, establishing the bank's first branch outside San Francisco in 1909 in San Jose. By 1929 the bank had 453 banking offices in California with aggregate resources of over US$1.4 billion.[21] There is a replica of the 1909 Bank of Italy branch bank in History Park in San Jose, and the 1925 Bank of Italy Building is an important downtown landmark. Giannini sought to build a national bank, expanding into most of the western states as well as into the insurance industry, under the aegis of his holding company, Transamerica Corporation.\n\n\nIn 1953 regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of Transamerica Corporation and Bank of America under the Clayton Antitrust Act.[22] The passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited banks from owning non-banking subsidiaries such as insurance companies. Bank of America and Transamerica were separated, with the latter company continuing in the insurance sector. However, federal banking regulators prohibited Bank of America's interstate banking activity, and Bank of America's domestic banks outside California were forced into a separate company that eventually became First Interstate Bancorp, later acquired by Wells Fargo and Company in 1996. Only in the 1980s, with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation, could Bank of America again expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside California.\n\n\nNew technologies also allowed the direct linking of credit cards with individual bank accounts. In 1958, the bank introduced the BankAmericard, which changed its name to Visa in 1977.[23] A coalition of regional bankcard associations introduced Interbank in 1966 to compete with BankAmericard. Interbank became Master Charge in 1966 and then MasterCard in 1979.[24]\n\n\nFrom February 1970 through September 1971, there were 66 attacks on Bank of America branches in California, including 53 bombings or fire-bombings, and 13 arson fires. There were \"few injuries\" and the property damage cost about $500,000, fourth-fifths of which was from the burning of the Isla Vista branch during a February 1970 riot.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion outside California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of the former Bank of America (BA), 1969\u20131998.\n![](image)The Bank of America Tower in 2015, seen from Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, the headquarters for the investment banking operations and serving as the bank's auxiliary headquarters.\nFollowing the passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by the US Congress,[26] BankAmerica Corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operating Bank of America and its subsidiaries.\n\n\nBank of America expanded outside California in 1983, with its acquisition, orchestrated in part by Stephen McLin, of Seafirst Corporation of Seattle, Washington, and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Seattle-First National Bank.[27] Seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the oil industry. BankAmerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as Seafirst rather than Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank.[27]\n\n\nBankAmerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 due to the placement of a series of bad loans in the Third World. The company fired its CEO, Sam Armacost, in 1986. Though Armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor, A. W. (Tom) Clausen, Clausen was appointed to replace Armacost.[*citation needed*] The losses resulted in a huge decline of BankAmerica stock, making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover. First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles (which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica), launched such a bid in the fall of 1986, although BankAmerica rebuffed it, mostly by selling operations.[28] It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to Chrysler and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Co. back to Mr. Schwab. It also sold Bank of America and Italy to Deutsche Bank. By the time of the 1987 stock-market crash, BankAmerica's share price had fallen to $8, but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily to become one of the biggest gainers of that half-decade.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBankAmerica's next big acquisition came in 1992. The company acquired Security Pacific Corporation and its subsidiary Security Pacific National Bank in California and other banks in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, which Security Pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s. This represented, at the time, the largest bank acquisition in history.[29] Federal regulators, however, forced the sale of roughly half of Security Pacific's Washington subsidiary, the former Rainier Bank, as the combination of Seafirst and Security Pacific Washington would have given BankAmerica too large a share of the market in that state. The Washington branches were divided and sold to West One Bancorp (now U.S. Bancorp) and KeyBank.[30] Later that year, BankAmerica expanded into Nevada by acquiring Valley Bank of Nevada.[31]\n\n\nIn 1994, BankAmerica acquired the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago. At the time, no bank possessed the resources to bail out Continental, so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade.[32] Illinois then regulated branch banking extremely heavily, so Bank of America Illinois was a single-unit bank until the 21st century. BankAmerica moved its national lending department to Chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region.[33]\n\n\nThese mergers helped BankAmerica Corporation to once again become the largest U.S. bank holding company in terms of deposits, but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind North Carolina's fast-growing NationsBank Corporation, and to third in 1998 behind First Union Corp.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn the capital markets side, the acquisition of Continental Illinois helped BankAmerica to build a leveraged finance origination- and distribution business, which allowed the firm's existing broker-dealer, BancAmerica Securities (originally named BA Securities), to become a full-service franchise.[34] In addition, in 1997, BankAmerica acquired Robertson Stephens, a San Francisco\u2013based investment bank specializing in high technology for $540\u00a0million.[35] Robertson Stephens was integrated into BancAmerica Securities, and the combined subsidiary was renamed \"BancAmerica Robertson Stephens\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bank of America logo used from 1998 to 2018\nIn 1997, BankAmerica lent investment management firm D. E. Shaw & Co. $1.4\u00a0billion in order to run various businesses for the bank.[37] However, D.E. Shaw suffered significant loss after the 1998 Russia bond default.[38][39] NationsBank of Charlotte acquired BankAmerica in October 1998 in what was the largest bank acquisition in history at that time.[40]\n\n\nWhile NationsBank was the nominal survivor, the merged bank took the better-known name of Bank of America. Hence, the holding company was renamed Bank of America Corporation, while NationsBank, N.A. merged with Bank of America NT&SA to form Bank of America, N.A. as the remaining legal bank entity.[41] The combined bank operates under Federal Charter 13044, which was granted to Giannini's Bank of Italy on March 1, 1927. However, the merged company was and still is headquartered in Charlotte, and retains NationsBank's pre-1998 stock price history. All U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings before 1998 are listed under NationsBank, not Bank of America. NationsBank president, chairman, and CEO Hugh McColl, took on the same roles with the merged company.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1998, Bank of America possessed combined assets of $570\u00a0 billion, as well as 4,800 branches in 22 U.S. states.[*citation needed*] Despite the size of the two companies, federal regulators insisted only upon the divestiture of 13 branches in New Mexico, in towns that would be left with only a single bank following the combination.[42] The broker-dealer, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, was named Banc of America Securities in 1998.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2001 to present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Typical Bank of America branch in Los Angeles\n![Mobile ATM](image)Emergency ATMs put in place after Hurricane Sandy, 2012\nIn 2001, McColl stepped down and named Ken Lewis as his successor. In 2004, Bank of America announced it would purchase Boston-based bank FleetBoston Financial for $47\u00a0billion in cash and stock.[43] By merging with Bank of America, all of its banks and branches were given the Bank of America logo. At the time of merger, FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with $197\u00a0billion in assets, over 20 million customers and revenue of $12\u00a0billion.[43] Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to *The Boston Globe*.\n\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant MBNA for $35\u00a0 billion in cash and stock. The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140\u00a0billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America, the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.\n\n\nBank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In May 2006, Bank of America and Banco Ita\u00fa (Investimentos Ita\u00fa S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement, through which Ita\u00fa agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil, and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay, in exchange for Ita\u00fa shares. The deal was signed in August 2006.\n\n\nPrior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay, it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Ita\u00fa stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Ita\u00fa to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.\n\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of The United States Trust Company for $3.3\u00a0billion, from the Charles Schwab Corporation. US Trust had about $100\u00a0billion of assets under management and over 150 years of experience. The deal closed July 1, 2007.[44]\n\n\nOn September 14, 2007, Bank of America won approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire LaSalle Bank Corporation from ABN AMRO for $21\u00a0billion. With this purchase, Bank of America possessed $1.7\u00a0trillion in assets. A Dutch court blocked the sale until it was later approved in July. The acquisition was completed on October 1, 2007. Many of LaSalle's branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade, such as Lansing and Detroit-based Michigan National Bank. The acquisition also included the Chicago Marathon event, which ABN AMRO acquired in 1996. Bank of America took over the event starting with the 2007 race.\n\n\nThe deal increased Bank of America's presence in Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana by 411 branches, 17,000 commercial bank clients, 1.4\u00a0million retail customers, and 1,500 ATMs. Bank of America became the largest bank in the Chicago market with 197 offices and 14% of the deposit share, surpassing JPMorgan Chase.\n\n\nLaSalle Bank and LaSalle Bank Midwest branches adopted the Bank of America name on May 5, 2008.[45]\n\n\nKen Lewis, who had lost the title of chairman of the board, announced that he would retire as CEO effective December 31, 2009, in part due to controversy and legal investigations concerning the purchase of Merrill Lynch. Brian Moynihan became president and CEO effective January 1, 2010, and afterward credit card charge offs and delinquencies declined in January. Bank of America also repaid the $45\u00a0billion it had received from the Troubled Assets Relief Program.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Acquisition of Countrywide Financial[edit]\n\n\nOn August 23, 2007, the company announced a $2\u00a0billion repurchase agreement for Countrywide Financial. This purchase of preferred stock was arranged to provide a return on investment of 7.25% *per annum* and provided the option to purchase common stock at a price of $18 per share.[48]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2008, Bank of America announced that it would buy Countrywide Financial for $4.1\u00a0billion.[49] In March 2008, it was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating Countrywide for possible fraud relating to home loans and mortgages.[50] This news did not hinder the acquisition, which was completed in July 2008,[51] giving the bank a substantial market share of the mortgage business, and access to Countrywide's resources for servicing mortgages.[52] The acquisition was seen as preventing a potential bankruptcy for Countrywide. Countrywide, however, denied that it was close to bankruptcy. Countrywide provided mortgage servicing for nine million mortgages valued at $1.4\u00a0trillion as of December 31, 2007.[53]\n\n\nThis purchase made Bank of America Corporation the leading mortgage originator and servicer in the U.S., controlling 20\u201325% of the home loan market.[54] The deal was structured to merge Countrywide with the Red Oak Merger Corporation, which Bank of America created as an independent subsidiary. It has been suggested that the deal was structured this way to prevent a potential bankruptcy stemming from large losses in Countrywide hurting the parent organization by keeping Countrywide bankruptcy remote.[55] Countrywide Financial has changed its name to Bank of America Home Loans.\n\n\nIn December 2011, the Justice Department announced a $335 million settlement with Bank of America over discriminatory lending practice at Countrywide Financial. Attorney General Eric Holder said a federal probe found discrimination against qualified African-American and Latino borrowers from 2004 to 2008. He said that minority borrowers who qualified for prime loans were steered into higher-interest-rate subprime loans.[56]\n\n\n\n#### Acquisition of Merrill Lynch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart showing the trajectory of BOA share value and transaction volume during the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis\nOn September 14, 2008, Bank of America announced its intention to purchase Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. in an all-stock deal worth approximately $50\u00a0billion. Merrill Lynch was at the time within days of collapse, and the acquisition effectively saved Merrill from bankruptcy.[57] Around the same time Bank of America was reportedly also in talks to purchase Lehman Brothers, however a lack of government guarantees caused the bank to abandon talks with Lehman.[58] Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy the same day Bank of America announced its plans to acquire Merrill Lynch.[59] This acquisition made Bank of America the largest financial services company in the world.[60] Temasek Holdings, the largest shareholder of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., briefly became one of the largest shareholders of Bank of America, with a 3% stake.[61] However, taking a loss Reuters estimated at $3\u00a0billion, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund sold its whole stake in Bank of America in the first quarter of 2009.[62]\n\n\nShareholders of both companies approved the acquisition on December 5, 2008, and the deal closed January 1, 2009.[63] Bank of America had planned to retain various members of the then Merrill Lynch's CEO, John Thain's management team after the merger.[64] However, after Thain was removed from his position, most of his allies left. The departure of Nelson Chai, who had been named Asia-Pacific president, left just one of Thain's hires in place: Tom Montag, head of sales and trading.[65]\n\n\nThe bank, in its January 16, 2009, earnings release, revealed massive losses at Merrill Lynch in the fourth quarter, which necessitated an infusion of money that had previously been negotiated[66] with the government as part of the government-persuaded deal for the bank to acquire Merrill. Merrill recorded an operating loss of $21.5\u00a0billion in the quarter, mainly in its sales and trading operations, led by Tom Montag. The bank also disclosed it tried to abandon the deal in December after the extent of Merrill's trading losses surfaced, but was compelled to complete the merger by the U.S. government. The bank's stock price sank to $7.18, its lowest level in 17 years, after announcing earnings and the Merrill mishap. The market capitalization of Bank of America, including Merrill Lynch, was then $45\u00a0billion, less than the $50\u00a0billion it offered for Merrill just four months earlier, and down $108\u00a0billion from the merger announcement.\n\n\nBank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis testified before Congress[7] that he had some misgivings about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and that federal official pressured him to proceed with the deal or face losing his job and endangering the bank's relationship with federal regulators.[67]\n\n\nLewis's statement is backed up by internal emails subpoenaed by Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee.[68] In one of the emails, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker threatened that if the acquisition did not go through, and later Bank of America were forced to request federal assistance, the management of Bank of America would be \"gone\". Other emails, read by Congressman Dennis Kucinich during the course of Lewis' testimony, state that Mr. Lewis had foreseen the outrage from his shareholders that the purchase of Merrill would cause, and asked government regulators to issue a letter stating that the government had ordered him to complete the deal to acquire Merrill. Lewis, for his part, states he didn't recall requesting such a letter.\n\n\nThe acquisition made Bank of America the number one underwriter of global high-yield debt, the third largest underwriter of global equity and the ninth largest adviser on global mergers and acquisitions.[69] As the credit crisis eased, losses at Merrill Lynch subsided, and the subsidiary generated $3.7\u00a0billion of Bank of America's $4.2\u00a0billion in profit by the end of quarter one in 2009, and over 25% in quarter 3 2009.[70][71]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2012, Bank of America settled the class-action lawsuit over the Merrill Lynch acquisition and will pay $2.43 billion.[72] This was one of the first major securities class action lawsuits stemming from the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 to settle. Many major financial institutions had a stake in this lawsuit, including Chicago Clearing Corporation, hedge funds, and bank trusts, due to the belief that Bank of America stock was a sure investment.\n\n\n\n#### Federal Troubled Asset Relief Program[edit]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2009, Bank of America received $20\u00a0billion and a guarantee of $118\u00a0billion in potential losses from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[73] This was in addition to the $25\u00a0billion given to the bank in the fall of 2008 through TARP. The additional payment was part of a deal with the U.S. government to preserve Bank of America's merger with Merrill Lynch.[74] Since then, members of the U.S. Congress have expressed considerable concern about how this money has been spent, especially since some of the recipients have been accused of misusing the bailout money.[75] Then CEO Ken Lewis was quoted as claiming \"We are still lending, and we are lending far more because of the TARP program.\" Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, however, were skeptical and quoted many anecdotes about loan applicants (particularly small business owners) being denied loans and credit card holders facing stiffer terms on the debt in their card accounts.\n\n\nAccording to an article in *The New York Times* published on March 15, 2009, Bank of America received an additional $5.2\u00a0billion in government bailout money via the bailout of American International Group.[76]\n\n\nAs a result of its federal bailout and management problems, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that the Bank of America was operating under a secret \"memorandum of understanding\" (MOU) from the U.S. government that requires it to \"overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management\". With the federal action, the institution has taken several steps, including arranging for six of its directors to resign and forming a Regulatory Impact Office. Bank of America faces several deadlines in July and August and if not met, could face harsher penalties by federal regulators. Bank of America did not respond to *The Wall Street Journal* story.[77]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2009, Bank of America announced it would repay the entire $45\u00a0billion it received in TARP and exit the program, using $26.2\u00a0billion of excess liquidity along with $18.6\u00a0billion to be gained in \"common equivalent securities\" (Tier 1 capital). The bank announced it had completed the repayment on December 9. Bank of America's Ken Lewis said during the announcement, \"We appreciate the critical role that the U.S. government played last fall in helping to stabilize financial markets, and we are pleased to be able to fully repay the investment, with interest.... As America's largest bank, we have a responsibility to make good on the taxpayers' investment, and our record shows that we have been able to fulfill that commitment while continuing to lend.\"[78][79]\n\n\n\n#### Bonus settlement[edit]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2009, Bank of America agreed to pay a $33\u00a0million fine, without admission or denial of charges, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the non-disclosure of an agreement to pay up to $5.8\u00a0billion of bonuses at Merrill. The bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the Merrill acquisition, in December 2008. The issue was originally investigated by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who commented after the suit and announced a settlement that \"the timing of the bonuses, as well as the disclosures relating to them, constituted a 'surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility'\" and \"our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to New York's Martin Act will continue.\" Congressman Kucinich commented at the same time that \"This may not be the last fine that Bank of America pays for how it handled its merger of Merrill Lynch.\"[80] A federal judge, Jed Rakoff, in an unusual action, refused to approve the settlement on August 5.[81]\nA first hearing before the judge on August 10 was at times heated, and he was \"sharply critic[al]\" of the bonuses. David Rosenfeld represented the SEC, and Lewis J. Liman, son of Arthur L. Liman, represented the bank. The actual amount of bonuses paid was $3.6\u00a0billion, of which $850\u00a0million was \"guaranteed\" and the rest was shared among 39,000 workers who received average payments of $91,000; 696 people received more than $1\u00a0million in bonuses; at least one person received a more than $33\u00a0million bonus.[82]\n\n\nOn September 14, the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than February 1, 2010. The judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank's shareholders, who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure. He wrote, \"It is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims' money should be used to make the case against the management go away,\" ... \"The proposed settlement,\" the judge continued, \"suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties: the S.E.C. gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the Bank of America in a high-profile merger; the bank's management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators. And all this is done at the expense, not only of the shareholders but also of the truth.\"[83]\n\n\nWhile ultimately deferring to the SEC, in February 2010, Judge Rakoff approved a revised settlement with a $150\u00a0million fine \"reluctantly\", calling the accord \"half-baked justice at best\" and \"inadequate and misguided\". Addressing one of the concerns he raised in September, the fine will be \"distributed only to Bank of America shareholders harmed by the non-disclosures, or 'legacy shareholders, an improvement on the prior $33\u00a0million while still \"paltry\", according to the judge. Case: SEC v. Bank of America Corp., 09-cv-06829, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.[84] Investigations also were held on this issue in the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,[83] under chairman Edolphus Towns (D-NY)[85] and in its investigative Domestic Policy Subcommittee under Kucinich.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Fraud[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. government accused the bank of defrauding schools, hospitals, and dozens of state and local government organizations via misconduct and illegal activities involving the investment of proceeds from municipal bond sales. As a result, the bank agreed to pay $137.7\u00a0million, including $25\u00a0million to the Internal Revenue Service and $4.5\u00a0million to the state attorney general, to the affected organizations to settle the allegations.[87] Former bank official Douglas Campbell pleaded guilty to antitrust, conspiracy, and wire fraud charges. As of January\u00a02011[update], other bankers and brokers are under indictment or investigation.[88]\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan filed a lawsuit alleging that Bank of America fraudulently cost American taxpayers more than $1 billion when Countrywide Financial sold toxic mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The scheme was called 'Hustle', or High Speed Swim Lane.[89][90] On May 23, 2016, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the finding of fact by the jury that low quality mortgages were supplied by Countrywide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the \"Hustle\" case supported only \"intentional breach of contract,\" not a fraud. The action, for civil fraud, relied on provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. The decision turned on lack of intent to defraud at the time the contract to supply mortgages was made.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Downsizing (2011 to 2014)[edit]\n\n\nDuring 2011, Bank of America began conducting personnel reductions of an estimated 36,000 people, contributing to intended savings of $5 billion per year by 2014.[92] In December 2011, *Forbes* ranked Bank of America's financial wealth 91st out of the nation's largest 100 banks and thrift institutions.[93]\n\n\nBank of America cut around 16,000 jobs in a quicker fashion by the end of 2012 as revenue continued to decline because of new regulations and a slow economy. This put a plan one year ahead of time to eliminate 30,000 jobs under a cost-cutting program, called Project New BAC.[94] In the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire bank purchased 20 Bank of America branches in Central and eastern New York for 14.4 million dollars. The branches were from Utica/Rome region and down the Mohawk Valley east to the capital region. In April and May 2014, Bank of America sold two dozen branches in Michigan to Huntington Bancshares. The locations were converted to Huntington National Bank branches in September.[95]\n\n\nAs part of its new strategy Bank of America is focused on growing its mobile banking platform. As of 2014[update], Bank of America has 31 million active online users and 16 million mobile users. Its retail banking branches have decreased to 4,900 as a result of increased mobile banking use and a decline in customer branch visits. By 2018, the number of mobile users has increased to 25.3 million and the number of locations fell to 4,411 at the end of June.[96]\n\n\n\n#### Sale of stake in China Construction Bank[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four banks in China, for US$3\u00a0billion.[97] It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and was looking to greatly expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal. In 2008, Bank of America was awarded Project Finance Deal of the Year at the 2008 ALB Hong Kong Law Awards.[98] In November 2011, Bank of America announced plans to divest most of its stake in the China Construction Bank.[99]\n\n\nIn September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion, marking the firm's full exit from the country.[100]\n\n\n\n#### $17 billion settlement with Justice Department[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Bank of America agreed to a near\u2013$17 billion deal to settle claims against it relating to the sale of toxic mortgage-linked securities including subprime home loans, in what was believed to be the largest settlement in U.S. corporate history. The bank agreed with the U.S. Justice Department to pay $9.65 billion in fines, and $7 billion in relief to the victims of the faulty loans which included homeowners, borrowers, pension funds and municipalities.[101] Real estate economist Jed Kolko said the settlement is a \"drop in the bucket\" compared to the $700 billion in damages done to 11 million homeowners. Since the settlement covered such a substantial portion of the market, he said for most consumers \"you're out of luck.\"[102]\n\n\nMuch of the government's prosecution was based on information provided by three whistleblowers \u2013 Shareef Abdou (a senior vice president at the bank), Robert Madsen (a professional appraiser employed by a bank subsidiary), and Edward O'Donnell (a Fannie Mae official). The three men received $170 million in whistleblower awards.[103]\n\n\n\n#### DOD Community Bank[edit]\n\n\n![](image)DOD Community Bank logo\nBank of America has formed a partnership with the United States Department of Defense creating a newly chartered bank **DOD Community Bank**[104] (\"Community Bank\") providing full banking services to military personnel at 68 branches and ATM locations[105] on U.S. military installations in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Cuba, Diego Garcia, Germany, Japan, Italy, Kwajalein Atoll, South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Even though Bank of America operates Community Bank, customer services are not interchangeable between the two financial institutions,[106] meaning that a Community Bank customer cannot go to a Bank of America branch and withdraw from their account and vice versa. Deposits made into checking and savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 despite the fact that none of Community's operating branches are located within the jurisdictional borders of the United States.\n\n\n\n#### Decision not to finance makers of military-style guns[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Bank of America announced that it would stop providing financing to makers of military-style weapons such as the AR-15 rifle.[107] In announcing the decision, Bank of America referenced recent mass shootings and said that it wanted to \"contribute in any way we can\" to reduce them.\n\n\n\n#### Return to expansion (2015\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bank of America footprint prior to its organic expansion into the Denver, Indianapolis, Ohio, Pittsburgh, and Twin Cities markets, 2015\n![](image)A Bank of America branch in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia\nIn 2015, Bank of America began expanding organically, opening branches in cities where it previously did not have a retail presence. They started that year in Denver, followed by Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul and Indianapolis, in all cases having at least one of its Big Four competitors, with Chase Bank being available in Denver and Indianapolis, while Wells Fargo is available in Denver and the Twin Cities.[108] The Twin Cities market is also the home market of U.S. Bancorp, the largest non-Big Four rival.\n\n\nIn January 2018, Bank of America announced an organic expansion of its retail footprint into Pittsburgh and surrounding areas, to supplement its existing commercial lending and investment businesses in the area. Before the expansion, Pittsburgh had been one of the largest US cities without a retail presence by any of the Big Four, with locally based PNC Financial Services (no. 6 nationally) having a commanding market share in the area;[108][109] this coincided with Chase making a similar expansion into Pittsburgh.[110] By the end of the fiscal year 2020, Bank of America had become Pittsburgh's 16th largest bank by deposits, which considering the dominance of PNC and BNY Mellon in the market is considered relatively impressive.[111] By 2021, Bank of America had moved up to 12th in the market.[112]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Bank of America announced it would expand into Ohio across the state's three biggest cities (Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati), which are strongholds of Chase.[113][114] Columbus serves as the bank's hub in Ohio due to its central location as the state's capital, its overall size and growth, and an existing Bank of America call center for its credit card division in suburban Westerville. Within a year of entering Ohio, Columbus quickly saw the bank become the 5th largest in the market by deposits, behind only banks either based in Ohio (Fifth Third Bank and locally based Huntington Bancshares) or have a major presence as a result of an acquisition of an Ohio-based institution (Chase and PNC), and ahead of US Bancorp (also with a large presence due to acquiring an Ohio-based bank), Ohio-based KeyBank, and several local institutions.[115] As of 2021, Bank of America is the 9th largest bank by deposits in all of Ohio.[112]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Bank of America hired new advisors whose primary functions are to assist ultra-wealthy clients.[116]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nBank of America generates 90% of its revenues in its domestic market. The core of Bank of America's strategy is to be the number one bank in its domestic market. It has achieved this through key acquisitions.[117]\n\n\n\n### Consumer Banking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bank of America branch in Washington, D.C.\nConsumer Banking, the largest division in the company, provides financial services to consumers and small businesses including, banking, investments, merchant services, and lending products including business loans, mortgages, and credit cards. It provides stockbroker services via Merrill Edge, a specific division for investment and related services (such as research and call center counsel) after Merrill Lynch became a subsidiary of Bank of America. The consumer banking division represented 38% of the company's total revenue in 2016.[118] The company earns revenue from interest income, service charges, and fees. In addition, the company is a mortgage servicer. It competes primarily with the retail banking arms of America's three other megabanks: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. The Consumer Banking organization includes over 4,600 retail financial centers and approximately 15,900 automated teller machines.\n\n\nBank of America is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that provides for reduced fees for consumers using their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance when travelling internationally. This feature is restricted to withdrawals using a debit card and users are still subject to foreign currency conversion fees, credit card withdrawals are still subject to cash advance fees and foreign currency conversion fees.\n\n\n\n### Global Banking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bank of America Tower, located on Laura Street in Jacksonville, Florida\nThe Global Banking division provides banking services, including investment banking and lending products to businesses. It includes the businesses of Global Corporate Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Business Banking, and Global Investment Banking. The division represented 22% of the company's revenue in 2016.[118]\n\n\nBefore Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Global Corporate and Investment Banking (GCIB) business operated as Banc of America Securities LLC. The bank's investment banking activities operate under the Merrill Lynch subsidiary and provided mergers and acquisitions advisory, underwriting, capital markets, as well as sales & trading in fixed income and equities markets. Its strongest groups include Leveraged Finance, Syndicated Loans, and mortgage-backed securities. It also has one of the largest research teams on Wall Street. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is headquartered in New York City.\n\n\n\n### Global Wealth and Investment Management[edit]\n\n\nThe Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) division manages the investment assets of institutions and individuals. It includes the businesses of Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and U.S. Trust and represented 21% of the company's total revenue in 2016.[118] It is among the 10 largest U.S. wealth managers. It has over $2.5 trillion in client balances.[118] GWIM has five primary lines of business: Premier Banking & Investments (including Bank of America Investment Services, Inc.), The Private Bank, Family Wealth Advisors, and Bank of America Specialist.\n\n\n\n### Global Markets[edit]\n\n\n![International relations](image)Chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan meeting the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in New Delhi, 2014\nThe Global Markets division offers services to institutional clients, including trading in financial securities. The division provides research and other services such as securities service, market maker, and risk management using derivatives. The division represented 19% of the company's total revenues in 2016.[118]\n\n\n\n### Labor[edit]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2019, the company announced minimum wage will be increased beginning May 1, 2019, to $17.00 an hour until it reaches a goal of $20.00 an hour in 2021.[119]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nThe Bank of America principal executive offices are located in the Bank of America Corporate Center, Charlotte, North Carolina. The skyscraper is located at 100 North Tryon Street, and stands at 871\u00a0ft (265 m), having been completed in 1992.\n\n\nIn 2012, Bank of America cut ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[120]\n\n\n\n#### International offices[edit]\n\n\nBank of America's Global Corporate and Investment Banking has its U.S. headquarters in Charlotte, European headquarters in Dublin, and Asian headquarters in Hong Kong and Singapore.[121]\n\n\n\n## Corporate governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBoard of Directors[122]\n| Name\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Brian Moynihan | Chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Bank of America Corporation\n |\n| Susan S.

Ken Lewis (2001\u20132009)[124]\n3. Brian Moynihan (2010\u2013 )[125]\n\n\n### CEO pay ratio[edit]\n\n\nPursuant to Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, publicly traded companies are required to disclose (1) the median total annual compensation of all employees other than the CEO and (2) the ratio of the CEO's annual total compensation to that of the median employee (CEO Pay Ratio).[126] Total 2018 compensation for Brian Moynihan, CEO, amounted to $22,765,354, and total compensation of the median employee was determined to be $92,040. The resulting pay ratio is estimated to be 247:1.[127]\n\n\n\n## Charitable efforts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bank of America volunteers at the Los Angeles LGBT pride parade in 2011\nIn 1998, the bank made a ten-year commitment of $350 billion to provide affordable mortgages, build affordable housing, support small businesses and create jobs in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.[128] In 2004, the bank pledged $750 million over a ten-year period for community development lending and affordable housing programs.[129]\n\n\nIn 2007, the bank offered employees a $3,000 rebate for the purchase of hybrid vehicles. The company also provided a $1,000 rebate or a lower interest rate for customers whose homes qualified as energy efficient.[130] In 2007, Bank of America partnered with Brighter Planet to offer an eco-friendly credit card, and later a debit card, which help build renewable energy projects with each purchase.[131] Bank of America has also donated money to help health centers in Massachusetts[132] and made a $1 million donation in 2007 to help homeless shelters in Miami.[133]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits, controversies, and incidents[edit]\n\n\n### Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n#### Parmalat lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nParmalat SpA is a multinational Italian dairy and food corporation. Following Parmalat's 2003 bankruptcy, the company sued Bank of America for $10\u00a0billion, alleging the bank profited from its knowledge of Parmalat's financial difficulties. The parties announced a settlement in July 2009, resulting in Bank of America paying Parmalat $98.5\u00a0million in October 2009.[134][135] In a related case, on April 18, 2011, an Italian court acquitted Bank of America and three other large banks, along with their employees, of charges they assisted Parmalat in concealing its fraud, and of lacking sufficient internal controls to prevent such frauds. Prosecutors did not immediately say whether they would appeal the rulings. In Parma, the banks were still charged with covering up the fraud.[136]\n\n\n\n#### Mortgage abuses[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2011, Bank of America was sued for $10 billion by American International Group over an alleged \"massive fraud\" on mortgage debt.[137] Another lawsuit filed against Bank of America, pertained to $57.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities Bank of America sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[138] That December, Bank of America agreed to pay $335 million to settle a federal government claim that Countrywide Financial had discriminated against Hispanic and African-American homebuyers from 2004 to 2008, prior to being acquired by BofA.[139] In September 2012, BofA settled out of court for $2.4 billion in a class action lawsuit filed by BofA shareholders who felt they were misled about the purchase of Merrill Lynch.[140]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[141] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and indirect payments to the states and the federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[142] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, American federal prosecutors filed a $1 billion civil lawsuit against Bank of America for mortgage fraud under the False Claims Act, which provides for possible penalties of triple the damages suffered. The government asserted that Countrywide, which was acquired by Bank of America, rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and forced taxpayers to guarantee billions of bad loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The suit was filed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, the inspector general of FHFA and the special inspector for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[143] In March 2014, Bank of America settled the suit by agreeing to pay $6.3 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to buy back around $3.2 billion worth of mortgage bonds.[144]\n\n\nA $7.5 million settlement was reached in April 2014 with former chief financial officer for Bank of America, Joe L. Price, over allegations that the bank's management withheld material information related to its 2008 merger with Merrill Lynch.[145] In August 2014, the United States Department of Justice and the bank agreed to a $16.65 billion agreement over the sale of risky, mortgage-backed securities before the Great Recession; the loans behind the securities were transferred to the company when it acquired banks such as Merrill Lynch and Countrywide in 2008.[146] As a whole, the three firms provided $965 billion of mortgage-backed securities from 2004 to 2008.[147] The settlement was structured to give $7 billion in consumer relief and $9.65 billion in penalty payments to the federal government and state governments; California, for instance, received $300 million to recompense public pension funds.[146][148] The settlement was the largest in United States history between a single company and the federal government.[149][150]\n\n\n\n#### Settlement with homeowners[edit]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2011, members of hacker group Anonymous began releasing emails said to be from a former Bank of America employee. According to the group, the emails documented alleged \"corruption and fraud\". The source, identified publicly as Brian Penny,[151] was a former LPI Specialist from Balboa Insurance, a firm which used to be owned by the bank, but was sold to Australian Reinsurance Company QBE.[152] On April 7, 2014, Bank of America and QBE settled a class-action lawsuit stemming from the leak for $228 million.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Unfair billing practices[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Bank of America to provide an estimated $727 million in relief to consumers harmed by practices related to credit card add-on products. According to the Bureau, roughly 1.4 million customers were affected by deceptive marketing of add-on products, and 1.9 million customers were illegally charged for credit monitoring and reporting services they were not receiving. The deceptive marketing misconduct involved telemarketing scripts containing misstatements and off-script sales pitches made by telemarketers that were misleading and omitted pertinent information. The unfair billing practices involved billing customers for privacy-related products without having the authorization necessary to perform the credit monitoring and credit report retrieval services. As a result, the company billed customers for services they did not receive, unfairly charged consumers for interest and fees, illegally charged approximately 1.9 million accounts, and failed to provide the product benefit.[154] In May 2022, CFPB ordered Bank of America to pay $10 million in penalties for illegal garnishments.[155]\n\n\n\n#### Discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, former senior executive Omeed Malik filed a $100 million arbitration case through FINRA against Bank of America after the company investigated him for alleged sexual misconduct.[156] His defamation claim was on the basis of retaliation, breach of contract, and discrimination against his Muslim background.[157] Malik received an eight-figure settlement in July of the same year.[158][159]\n\n\n\n#### Fake accounts, junk fees and withheld rewards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that a total of $250 million in fines and compensation has been levied against Bank of America for \"deceptive practices that harmed hundreds of thousands of consumers,\" including double charging insufficient funds fees, withholding credit card rewards, and opening accounts without the knowledge or permission of customers.[160]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n#### Consumer credit controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2008, Bank of America began notifying some customers without payment problems that their interest rates were more than doubled, up to 28%. The bank was criticized for raising rates on customers in good standing, and for declining to explain why it had done so.[161][162] In September 2009, a Bank of America credit card customer, Ann Minch, posted a video on YouTube criticizing the bank for raising her interest rate. After the video went viral, she was contacted by a Bank of America representative who lowered her rate. The story attracted national attention from television and internet commentators.[163][164][165] In 2010, the bank was criticized for allegedly seizing three properties that were not under their ownership, apparently due to incorrect addresses on their legal documents.[166]\n\n\n\n#### State of Arizona investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010 the state of Arizona launched an investigation into Bank of America for misleading homeowners who sought to modify their mortgage loans. According to the attorney general of Arizona, the bank \"repeatedly has deceived\" such mortgagors. In response to the investigation, the bank has given some modifications on the condition that the homeowners remove some information criticizing the bank online.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Investment in coal mining[edit]\n\n\nOn May 6, 2015, Bank of America announced it would reduce its financial exposure to coal companies. The announcement came following pressure from universities and environmental groups. The new policy was announced as part of the bank's decision to continue to reduce credit exposure over time to the coal mining sector.[168]\n\n\n\n### Incidents[edit]\n\n\n#### Wikileaks incident[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Julian Assange of WikiLeaks claimed that his organization possessed a 5 gigabyte hard drive formerly used by a Bank of America executive and that Wikileaks intended to publish its contents.[169] In November 2010, *Forbes* published an interview with Assange in which he stated his intent to publish information which would turn a major U.S. bank \"inside out\".[170] In response to this announcement, Bank of America stock dropped 3.2%.[171]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Bank of America announced that it would no longer service requests to transfer funds to WikiLeaks,[172] stating that \"Bank of America joins in the actions previously announced by MasterCard, PayPal, Visa Europe, and others and will not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for WikiLeaks... This decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are, among other things, inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments.\"[173]\n\n\nLater in December, it was announced that Bank of America purchased more than 300 Internet domain names in an attempt to preempt bad publicity that might be forthcoming in the anticipated WikiLeaks release. The domain names included as *BrianMoynihanBlows.com*, *BrianMoynihanSucks.com* and similar names for other top executives of the bank.[174][175][176][177]\n\n\nSometime before August 2011, WikiLeaks claimed that 5\u00a0GB of Bank of America leaks was part of the deletion of over 3500 communications by Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a now ex-WikiLeaks volunteer.[178][179]\n\n\n\n#### Ryan Coogler incident[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2022, the bank was involved in a incident related to the notable filmmaker Ryan Coogler who was wrongly targeted as a bank robber and detained by the police in Atlanta, Georgia, after Coogler tried to withdraw cash in the local branch of the Bank of America. After his identity was verified with both his California state ID card and his Bank of America card, Coogler was released and the bank released an apology statement. According to a number of sources, the bank's teller hadn't checked Coogler's ID to verify if he was the owner of the bank account before she asked the bank's supervisor to call police.[180][181][182][183]\n\n\n\n## Competition[edit]\n\n\nBank of America's major competitors are Wells Fargo, Santander, PNC Financial Services, Ally Financial, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase Bank, US Bank, Citizens Financial Group, Citigroup, M&T Bank, and Truist.\n\n\n\n## Notable buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia, is the tallest building in the Southern United States.\n![](image)Bank of America Stadium, home to the Carolina Panthers of the NFL\nNotable buildings which Bank of America currently occupies include:\n\n\n\n* Bank of America Tower in Phoenix, Arizona\n* 9454 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California\n* Bank of America Center in Los Angeles, California\n* Transamerica Pyramid, in San Francisco\n* 555 California Street, formerly the Bank of America Center and world headquarters, in San Francisco, California\n* City Place I, also known as United Healthcare Center, in Hartford, Connecticut (the tallest building in Connecticut)\n* Bank of America Plaza in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n* Bank of America Tower in Jacksonville, Florida\n* Bank of America Financial Center (Brickell) and Bank of America Museum Tower (Downtown Miami) in Miami, Florida\n* Bank of America Center in Orlando, Florida\n* Bank of America Tower in St. Petersburg, Florida\n* Bank of America Plaza in Tampa, Florida\n* Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia\n* Bank of America Building, formerly the LaSalle Bank Building in Chicago, Illinois\n* One City Center, often called the Bank of America building due to signage rights, in Portland, Maine\n* Bank of America Building in Baltimore, Maryland\n* Bank of America Plaza in St Louis, Missouri\n* Bank of America Tower in Albuquerque, New Mexico\n* Bank of America Tower in New York City\n* Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina (the corporate headquarters)\n* Bank of America Plaza in Charlotte, North Carolina\n* Bank of America Tower in Charlotte, North Carolina\n* Hearst Tower in Charlotte, North Carolina\n* Bank of America Plaza in Dallas, Texas\n* Bank of America Tower in Midland, Texas\n* Bank of America Plaza in San Antonio, Texas\n* Bank of America Fifth Avenue Plaza in Seattle, Washington\n* Columbia Center in Seattle, Washington\n* Bank of America Tower in Hong Kong\n\n\nIn 2010, the bank completed construction of the 1 Bank of America Center in Charlotte center city.

Atwood Building in Anchorage, Alaska, was at one time named the Bank of America Center, renamed in conjunction with the bank's acquisition of building tenant Security Pacific Bank. This particular branch was later acquired by Alaska-based Northrim Bank and moved across the street to the Linny Pacillo Parking Garage.\n\n\nThe Bank of America Building (Providence) opened in 1928 as the Industrial Trust Building and remains the tallest building in Rhode Island. Through a number of mergers, it was later known as the Industrial National Bank building and the Fleet Bank building. The building was leased by Bank of America from 2004 to 2012 and has been vacant since March 2013. The building is commonly known as the Superman Building based on a popular belief that it was the model for the Daily Planet building in the Superman comic books.\n\n\nThe Miami Tower iconic in its appearance in *Miami Vice* was known as the Bank of America Tower for many years. It is located in Downtown Miami. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed it on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places as the Bank of America Tower.[185]\n\n\nTC Energy Center in Houston, Texas, was previously known as Bank of America Center until Bank of America ended its tenancy in the building in June 2019. Designed in the postmodern architecture style by renowned architect Philip Johnson, the building has been one of the most recognizable landmarks of the downtown Houston skyline since it was completed in 1983.[186]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of members ATM Industry Association (ATMIA)\n* BAML Capital Partners\n* Bank of America (Asia)\n* Big Four banks\n* *Calibuso, et al. v.

Bank of America had the entire state of California as a potential market, and when it issued BankAmericard in 1958, the card was an instant success. [...] In many countries, there was still a reluctance to issue a card associated with Bank of America, even though the association was entirely nominal in nature. For this reason, in 1977 BankAmericard became the Visa card, retaining its distinctive blue, white and gold flag. NBI became Visa U.S.A., and IBANCO became Visa International.\n24. **^** Stearns, David L. (2011). *Electronic Value Exchange: Origins of the Visa Electronic Payment System*.

With capital provided by the Ministry of Finance of China,[12] the bank's Tier 1 capital in 2013 was the largest of one thousand global banks, being the first bank headquartered in China to achieve this distinction in modern history.[13][9] Subsequently, ranked the largest bank in the world 2017 and 2018, by total assets,[14] (31 December 2020, US$4.324 trillion[8]), ICBC was positioned at 1st in The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks ranking, every year from 2012,[15] and first (2019) on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's biggest public companies.[16] ICBC is also the 3rd largest bank in the world by market capitalization at $211 billion (31-Dec-2022).[17]\n\n\nFurthermore, ICBC is considered one of the most profitable companies in the world, ranking fourth according to Forbes.[18] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\nSeveral former employees of ICBC have moved on to work in prominent government positions in China. Notable ICBC alumni include Chairman of CSRC Huiman Yi, and Deputy Governor of PBoC Gongsheng Pan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ICBC building in Tokyo\n![](image)ICBC building in Luxembourg\n![](image)ICBC building in Karachi\n![](image)ICBC Beijing Qunfang Sub-branch at Universal Beijing Resort\n### Preconditions of 1948\u20131979[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1948 the mono-banking system of China was the People's Bank of China, providing both policy lending, and, operations to the commercial sector. During 1978 to[19] 1979 banking reform was initiated by the government of China, with the express desire of bringing into existence a central bank accompanying four total central governmentally owned specializing banks, one of these four being ICBC.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1979\u20131985[edit]\n\n\nA Two-Tier banking system was made.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1984\u20132005[edit]\n\n\nBy rights of a contradiction within the economic functioning of the government of China, the People's Republic, the State Council of China,[21] during September of[22] 1983 made a decision to separate certain activities of the government to an exclusively operating organisation, subsequently named the Industrial and Commercial bank of China,[21] established on 1 January 1984.[11][*non-primary source needed*] ICBC was then the fourth of the four specialist banks of 1978\u20131979 to be made,[22] from the taking of control of commercial activities[22] (\"industrial credit and savings business\"[23]) from People's Bank of China so that the latter might be transformed to a newly made central bank.[22][23] ICBC focused on the intermediation of deposits.[24]:\u200a225\n\n\nICBC opened a branch in Luxembourg which became the European headquarters of the bank in 2011.[25] ICBC (Europe) S.A. operates a network covering branches in major European cities, namely Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Warsaw and Lisbon.[26]\n\n\nThe bank's Hong Kong operations are listed under the name ICBC Asia. It has purchased the Hong Kong subsidiary of Fortis Bank and rebranded it under its own name on 10 October 2005.\n\n\nIn June 2005, ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co., Ltd., a joint venture between ICBC (55%), Credit Suisse First Boston (25%) and COSCO (20%), was formally established in China. Subsequently, ICBC acquired the 20% stake from COSCO and a 5% stake from CSFB.\n\n\n\n### 2006\u20132008[edit]\n\n\n#### Customer base[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2006, ICBC had 2.5\u00a0million corporate customers and 150 million individual customers.[27]\n\n\n\n#### IPO[edit]\n\n\nIn the runup to its planned initial public offering, on 28 April 2006, three \"strategic investors\" injected US$3.7\u00a0billion into ICBC:\n\n\n\n* Goldman Sachs purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6\u00a0billion, the largest sum Goldman Sachs has ever invested.[28]\n* Dresdner Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of Commerzbank) invested US$1\u00a0billion.[29]\n* American Express invested US$200\u00a0million.[29]\n\n\nICBC was simultaneously listed on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange on 27 October 2006. It was the world's largest IPO at that time valued at US$21.9\u00a0billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4\u00a0billion IPO by Japan's NTT DoCoMo in 1998.[30] In 2010, Agricultural Bank of China broke ICBC's IPO record when it raised $22.1\u00a0billion. China's largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.\n\n\nICBC raised at least US$14\u00a0billion in Hong Kong (H-shares) and another US$5.1\u00a0billion in Shanghai (A-shares). Due to heavy subscriptions, the greenshoe (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and ICBC's take rose to US$21.9\u00a0billion (17% of ICBC's market value before the IPO), divided in US$16\u00a0billion in Hong Kong and US$5.9\u00a0billion in Shanghai. Following the global offering, the free float of shares was 22.14% of the market capitalization.\n\n\nAt the end of its first day of trading, the bank's shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in Hong Kong, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to Bloomberg, ICBC's market capitalisation at the end of trade based on its Hong Kong shares was US$156.3\u00a0billion, making its equity the world's fifth highest among banks, just behind JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, ICBC's Shanghai-listed A-shares recorded more modest gains and ended up 5.1% from the offering price of RMB 3.12.\n\n\nDuring July 2007 ICBC was ranked 30th in the world in terms of revenue.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign activity[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, ICBC became the second Chinese bank since 1991 to gain federal approval to establish a branch in New York City.[32] ICBC had signed a lease with the Trump Organization for office space in the Trump Tower in 2008. ICBC was Trump Tower's largest office tenant as of 2012.[33] By October 2020, Donald Trump received $5.4 million from ICBC via the Trump Tower lease.[34]\n\n\nICBC loans $400\u00a0million towards the completion of the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia. Groups that oppose the dam such as International Rivers and Survival International have complained about or have written to ICBC against the dam's funding.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 January 2011, ICBC opened a branch office in Madrid, Spain.[37]\n\n\nOn 20 May 2011, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. established two branches in Pakistan, one in Karachi, the other in Islamabad. On 18 August 2011, ICBC passed the examination from State Bank of Pakistan and started its business in Pakistan.\n\n\nDuring November 2012, ICBC acquires a 80% stake (valued at $600\u00a0million) of Standard Bank Argentina, the largest operation of a Chinese bank in Latin America. In Argentina, the bank has ~1,000,000 individual customers, ~30,000 companies of all categories and more than 1600 corporate companies.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[38]\n\n\nIt was announced at the end of July 2013 that South Africa's Standard Bank was in talks to sell its markets business in London to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for more than $500\u00a0million.[39]\n\n\nOn 24 September 2014, ICBC Kuwait Branch officially opened in Kuwait City, capital of Kuwait. As the first and currently the only Chinese bank in Kuwait, the establishment of ICBC Kuwait Branch ended the history of no Chinese bank's presence in Kuwait. Meanwhile, it is also the fourth branch of ICBC in the Middle East, following branches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha.\n\n\nAs of 2 December 2014, ICBC is ranked the largest bank in the world by assets and by tier 1 capital.[40]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2015, the Company further strengthened its presence in the Middle East and Europe by purchasing[41] Turkey's TekstilBank and forming its ICBC Turkey subsidiary.\n\n\nOn 17 February 2016, the Spanish Guardia Civil raided the offices of ICBC in Madrid, Spain, investigating suspicions of money laundering.[37]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2016, the bank obtained a license to take deposits in Russia.\n\n\nICBC Financial Services, the bank's brokerage unit, provided about $88\u00a0billion of repo financing at the end of 2015, up from $59\u00a0billion two years ago, according to regulatory filings. The figures are before netting agreements that can be used to reduce overall assets and liabilities. Almost all the repo financing that ICBC provides is on U.S. government bonds.[42]\n\n\nICBC launched robo-advisor service to its wealth-management operations in 2017.[43][44]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Bank reported a 3.3 percent rise in its net profit for the third quarter.[45]\n\n\nICBC reported 10.3 pct growth in its profit along with exceptional growth in its revenue during the year 2021. This was caused by the gradual recovery of the Chinese economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.[46]\n\n\nIn November 2023, the bank was subject to a ransomware attack, preventing certain trades from clearing.[47]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n### Accounting[edit]\n\n\nICBC has the policy[48] of preparing accounts conforming to the[8] International Financial Reporting Standards,[49][8] accepting specifically criteria IFRS 9 (pertains to the definition and rating of asset, liability, and a number of all of the existing purchasing contracts for non-financial purchases[50]) from 1 January 2018. and IFRS 16 (pertaining to lease[51]) from 1 January 2019.[48]\n\n\n\n### Basic figures[edit]\n\n\n#### 2005[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, net profit was up 12.4% to RMB 33.7\u00a0billion, and the total loan balance was RMB 3,289.5\u00a0billion. Total liabilities are RMB 6,196.2\u00a0billion, up 11.2%. Delinquent or non-performing loans (NPL) total RMB 154.4\u00a0billion, a significant reduction although the figures are widely regarded as being somewhat higher than officially stated. It has an NPL ratio of 4.69% and a capital adequacy ratio of 9.89%.\n\n\n\n#### Summary[edit]\n\n\n##### 2003\u20132018[edit]\n\n\nFinancials in Renminbi[5][52][53][54][55][56][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue, bln | 107.5 | 126.7 | 193.1 | 181.6 | 257.4 | 310.2 | 309.4 | 380.7\n |\n| Net Income, bln | 2.473 | 2.311 | 33.70 | 49.26 | 81.52 | 110.8 | 129.4 | 166.0\n |\n| Assets, trln | 5.279 | 5.671 | 6.454 | 7.509 | 8.684 | 9.757 | 11.79 | 13.46\n |\n| Equity, bln | 170.5 | 163.0 | 253.4 | 466.5 | 538.4 | 602.7 | 673.9 | 820.4\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue, bln | 470.6 | 529.7 | 578.9 | 634.9 | 668.7 | 641.7 | 675.7 | 725.1\n |\n| Net Income, bln | 208.4 | 238.7 | 263.0 | 276.3 | 277.7 | 279.1 | 287.5 | 298.7\n |\n| Assets, trln | 15.48 | 17.54 | 18.92 | 20.61 | 22.21 | 24.14 | 26.09 | 27.70\n |\n| Equity, bln | 956.7 | 1125 | 1274 | 1531 | 1789 | 1970 | 2127 | 2330\n |\n\n\n### Loans[edit]\n\n\n#### Listed to industry[edit]\n\n\nIn millions of Chinese RMB (Yuan) in 2005:\n\n\n\n* Manufacturing: 662,376, 20.1% (28.7% in 2004)\n* Transportation, storage, postage & telecommunications: 367,371, 11.2% (10.2% in 2004)\n* Power, gas and water: 281,179, 8.6% (7.0% in 2004)\n* Retail and wholesale, catering: 265,906, 8.1% (6.9% in 2004)\n* Property development: 194,024, 5.9%, (5.6% in 2004)\n* Social service organization: 103,070, 3.1%, (3.2% in 2004)\n* Construction: 89,666, 2.7%, (2.1% in 2004)\n* Other industries: 313,804, 9.5%, (12.1% in 2004)\n* Discounted bills: 392,717, 11.9%, (8.4% in 2004)\n* Personal loans: 515,042, 15.7%, (13.1% in 2004)\n* Overseas business: 104,398, 3.2%, (2.7% in 2004)\n\n\nTotal: 3,289,553\n\n\n\n#### With collateralization[edit]\n\n\n* Secured by mortgages: 34.1%\n* Secured by other collateral: 22.1%\n* Guaranteed loans: 23.3%\n* Unsecured loans: 20.5%\n\n\n#### Non-performing[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of 2004, 19.1% of ICBC's portfolio consisted of non-performing loans.[58] To clean up ICBC's balance sheet and prepare it for overseas listing, the Chinese government orchestrated a series of capital injections, asset transfers, and government-subsidised bad loan disposals that eventually cost more than US$162\u00a0billion.[59] This included an approval for a cash injection of US$15\u00a0billion (financed from China's massive foreign exchange reserves) on 28 April 2005.[60] The Beijing-based state company, China Huarong Asset Management, helped ICBC dispose of its bad loans. As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks are typically around 1%).[61]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe company has 449,226 employees. There are 24 members of the board, with one chairman, one supervisory board chairman and one vice-chairman. Chen Siqing, the current chairman, assumed his role[62] after resigning in April 2019 from Bank of China, where he was the chair, executive director and chairman and participating board member within the Strategic Development Committee. Siqing had no disagreement with the Board at the time of his resignation, made purely for the reason of vocational change to ICBC.[63] Yi Huiman, the previous chairman, finished with the company to fulfil the position of chairman at the China Securities Regulatory Commission.[64]\n\n\nAs of 17 May 2020, the board is as stands:[65]\n\n\n\n* Chen Siqing (\u9648\u56db\u6e05), chairman of ICBC, former Bank of China chairman[2]\n* Gu Shu, president of ICBC\n* Lu Yongzhen, former director on the National Development and Reform Commission\n* Zheng Fuqing, former Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China official\n* Mei Yingchun, former Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China and World Bank official\n* Feng Weidong, former secretary of the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China\n* Cao Liqun, former State Administration of Foreign Exchange official\n* Anthony Francis Neoh, former Hong Kong SEC chairman\n* Yang Siu Shun, former chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers Hong Kong\n* Shen Si, former executive director of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank\n* Nout Wellink, former president and chairman of De Nederlandsche Bank\n* Fred Zuliu Hu, former IMF and World Economic Forum official\n\n\n## Environmental policy and record[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008 ICBC was the first Chinese Bank to adopt the Equator Principles, an international set of social and environmental standards for financial institutions launched in 2003.[66] It has also adopted the Green Credit Policy launched in 2007 by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection.[67] International environmental groups have criticized ICBC for failing to adhere to its social environmental standards and of being hypocritical, because ICBC is involved in the financing of the controversial Gilgel Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia.[66]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n\n* ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia)\n* ICBC Standard Bank Plc\n* ICBC International Securities Limited\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Canada)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China USA NA\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Mexico)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Thai)\n* ICBC Turkey\n* ICBC Argentina\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Pakistan)\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Zurich)\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, the Chinese government arrested several government officials in addition to bankers with regards to the accusation of a scheme to take illegally US$900\u00a0million from ICBC.[68]\n\n\nIn November 2015, ICBC Standard Bank, an overseas subsidiary acquired in February of that year, agreed to pay a fine of a maximum of $40\u00a0million to UK authorities.[69]\n\n\nOn 17 February 2016, the Spanish Guardia Civil supported by Europol, arrested six executives of the Spanish location of the bank accused of money-laundering.[70]\n\n\nIn 2018, the US Federal Reserve had found \"serious deficiencies\" of the bank, on, anti-money laundering protections.[71]\n\n\nOn 12 August 2021, a former senior banker at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Gu Guoming was sentenced to life in jail by Chinese authorities, after being found guilty of bribery.[72]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* *Forbes Global 2000* \u2013 the World's Largest Public Company[73][74]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chinese language version and transliteration here does not include the word \"Limited\", as shown within the introduction; c.f.

In 2015, CCB was the 2nd largest bank in the world by market capitalization and 6th largest company in the world.[3][4] The bank has approximately 13,629 domestic branches. In addition, it maintains overseas branches in London, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, New York City, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Santiago de Chile, Brisbane, Sydney and Auckland. Its total assets reached CN\u00a5 8.7\u00a0trillion in 2009,[5] and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. Its headquarters is in Xicheng District, Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Branch in Xinhui, Guangdong\nCCB was founded on 1 October 1954 under the name of People's Construction Bank of China (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u5efa\u8bbe\u94f6\u884c; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 R\u00e9nm\u00edn Ji\u00e0nsh\u00e8 Y\u00ednh\u00e1ng*), and later changed to China Construction Bank on 26 March 1996. It was established in order to focus on financing for investments, in the context of the People's Bank of China beginning to spin off its commercial banking functions.[7]:\u200a225\n\n\nIn January 2002, CCB Chairman Wang Xuebing resigned from the bank after being charged with accepting bribes while he was employed with Bank of China; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In March 2005, his successor, Zhang Enzhao, resigned for \"personal reasons\". Just prior to his resignation, he had been charged in a lawsuit with accepting a US$1\u00a0million bribe. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail in connection with the case.[8][9]\n\n\nChina Construction Bank Corporation was formed as a joint-stock commercial bank in September 2004 as a result of a separation procedure undertaken by its predecessor, China Construction Bank, under the PRC Company Law. Following the China Banking Regulatory Committee's approval on 14 September 2004, the next day the bank (Jianyin) became a separate legal entity, owned by the Chinese government holding company, Central Huijin Investment Company or simply Huijin.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the China Construction Bank halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[10]\n\n\nIn 2015, China Construction Bank ranks the 2nd in *Forbes*\u2019 13th annual Global 2000 ranking of the biggest, most powerful and most valuable companies in the world.[11]\n\n\nIn 2021, China Construction Bank ranks the 3rd largest bank around the world in Forbes' 2021 Global 2000 list.[12] It ranks 5th in Forbes' 2022 Global 2000 list.\n\n\n\n## Investment by Bank of America[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3\u00a0billion. It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal.\n\n\nOn or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America now holds about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB's issued shares. Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB. Bank of America still has the option to purchase additional shares.[13]\n\n\nIn May 2009, speculation was raised that US$7.3\u00a0billion worth of CCB shares had been sold by BoA after being ordered to obtain more capital following the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test.[14]\n\n\nOn 29 August 2011, Bank of America announced it would sell approximately half its stake in CCB (13.1 billion shares worth about US$8.3\u00a0billion) to an undisclosed group of investors.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion.[16]\n\n\nIn June 2017, China Construction Bank (Malaysia) signs 13 Memorandum of Understandings on its opening day in Malaysia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, CCB acquired Bank of America (Asia), which started in 1912 in Hong Kong as Bank of Canton, and had a subsidiary in Macao.\n\n\nCCB opened a London office on 2 June 2009.\n\n\nIn 2008, CCB submitted an application to the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board to establish a branch in New York City.[17][18] CCB officially opened its New York branch on 6 June 2009.\n\n\nIn 2013, CCB opened its European Headquarters in Luxembourg.[19]\n\n\nIn 2016, CCB Indonesia was founded by the merger between two banks: Bank Windu Kentjana and Bank Anda.\n\n\n\n## Health fund[edit]\n\n\nChina Construction Bank investment division launched a CN\u00a55\u00a0billion (US$731.3\u00a0million) fund called **China Healthcare Investment Fund** to focus on investments in China's rapidly growing healthcare sector. The fund focuses on investments in healthcare related sectors including pharmacy, medical equipment manufacturing, medical institutions and services. It is the first domestic investment fund specializing in investments in China's healthcare industry.[20]\n\n\n\n## Stock exchanges listing[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2005, China Construction Bank made an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. In late 2007, it made China's second-largest initial public offering of CN\u00a557.12\u00a0billion (US$7.6\u00a0billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\n\nThe bank is a component of Hang Seng Index, SSE 180 Index and other indexes of Pan-Chinese and Pan-Asia stock exchanges, such as CSI 300 Index, Hang Seng China 50 Index, FTSE China A50 Index and S&P Asia 50.\n\n\nThe bank was also a component of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* *Global 2000 Rank #2* - World's Largest Public Companies in 2016[21]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Annual Report 2018\" (PDF).

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

The policy has been maintained through the Global Recession of 2008\u201309, as Westpac acquired St George Bank and the Commonwealth Bank acquired Bankwest, reinforcing the special status of the \"big four\".\n\n\n\n## Austria[edit]\n\n\nThe \"Big Four\" banks of Austria are:[7]\n\n\n\n* Erste Bank / Sparkasse\\* (credit unions)\n* UniCredit Bank Austria (formerly Bank Austria Creditanstalt)\n* Raiffeisen Bankengruppe\\*\n* BAWAG P.S.K.

They were contrasted with the Three Southern Banks of Southern China.\n\n\nBy 1949, the \"big four\" banks were the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China. All four were state-owned. Together with the Central Trust of China, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of China, and Central Cooperative Treasury of China, these banks were called the \"four banks, two bureaus, one treasury\" or \"\u56db\u884c\u4e24\u5c40\u4e00\u5e93\".[13]\n\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the Big Five Banks (\"\u4e94\u5927\u94f6\u884c\") are:[14]\n\n\n\n1.

The related term city bank is also sometimes used for these banks. The \"big three\" are:\n\n\n\n* Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\n* SMBC Group\n* Mizuho Financial Group\n\n\nJapan had a \"big four\" between 2002 and 2005 when the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UFJ Japan were still separate entities.[28] The two merged to form Mitsubishi UFJ, now the largest of the three, in 2005.\n\n\nThese banks are all listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange (where they are constituents of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices) and the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts; MUFG and SMBC Group are both additionally listed in the Nagoya Stock Exchange and serve as the financial arms of their respective namesake *keiretsu* (Mitsubishi for MUFG, Sumitomo and Mitsui for SMBC).\n\n\n\n## Kenya[edit]\n\n\n* KCB Bank Kenya Limited\n* Equity Bank\n* Co-operative Bank\n* NCBA Group\n\n\n## Lebanon[edit]\n\n\nIn Lebanon, where the banks have retained their banking secrecy laws since 1956, which is prevalent in the whole MENA region, and while adopting international measures to fight money laundering, the \"big four\" banks consist of:[29]\n\n\n\n* Bank Audi (founded in 1830 and ranked on the Forbes Magazine Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world in 2016)\n* Byblos Bank (founded in 1950 as \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale et Agricole Byblos Bassil Fr\u00e8res & Co.\")\n* BLOM Bank: Banque du Liban et d'Outre-Mer S.A.L (founded in 1951)\n* Fransabank (founded in 1921 as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale de Banque)\n\n\nFurthermore, as of September 2016, there are more than 51 banks in Lebanon, one of the smallest countries in the Middle East, a fact that has always made investors from the Arab countries, especially the GCC petrodollar in addition to the European and world investors, to place their funds in the Lebanese banks.\n\n\n\n## Luxembourg[edit]\n\n\nThe \"big four\" full-service banks in Luxembourg are:[30]\n\n\n\n* Banque et Caisse d'\u00c9pargne de l'\u00c9tat (Spuerkeess), state owned bank\n* Banque Internationale \u00e0 Luxembourg,\n* BGL BNP Paribas\n* ING Luxembourg\n\n\nThere are bigger banks in Luxembourg, but these only deliver a limited number of services such as investment banking, private banking, or corporate banking only.

The big four Australian banks (often referred to collectively as the 'big banks'[37][38][39] or the 'big Aussie banks') also dominate the banking sector in New Zealand, through subsidiaries:\n\n\n\n* ANZ Bank New Zealand (ANZ), a subsidiary of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group\n* ASB Bank (ASB), formerly Auckland Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n* Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), a subsidiary of the National Australia Bank\n* Westpac New Zealand (WBC), formerly WestpacTrust, after a merger with Trust Bank, a subsidiary of Westpac Banking Corporation\n\n\nTogether they hold over 90% of gross loans and advances in New Zealand[40] as well as close to 90% of all mortgages.[41]\n\n\nThese four NZ subsidiaries are massively profitable and sometimes even outperform the Australian parent companies.[42] The extent to which they dominate the banking sector can be seen in profits: In the 2012/2013 financial year, the largest of the Big Banks, ANZ New Zealand, made a profit of NZ$1.37 billion. The smallest, BNZ, made a profit of NZ$695 million.[37] State-owned Kiwibank, community trust-owned TSB Bank, SBS Bank (formerly Southland Building Society) and Heartland Bank, the next four largest banks by profit, made NZ$97 million,[43] NZ$73.5 million,[44] NZ$14 million[45] and NZ$7 million (albeit with an underlying result of about NZ$30 million) respectively.[46] Thus, the profit of New Zealand's next four largest banks (after the Big Four) is equal to less than 30% of the smallest of the Big Four, BNZ.\n\n\n\n## Nigeria[edit]\n\n\nThe term \"Big Five\" is used instead of four, with five banks dominating the Nigerian banking world. In 2011, these top five banks had a combined balance sheet, including contingents, of 12.9 trillion naira ($821 billion), 33 percent higher than the prior year.[47]\n\n\n\n* Zenith Bank\n* First Bank of Nigeria\n* Guaranty Trust Bank\n* Access Bank\n* United Bank for Africa (UBA)\n\n\n## North Macedonia[edit]\n\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the three largest banks in North Macedonia dominate 60% of the banking market share.[48]\n\n\n\n* Komercijalna banka Skopje\n* Stopanska Banka\n* NLB Tutunska\n\n\n## Pakistan[edit]\n\n\nThe \"top five\" banks of Pakistan are:[49]\n\n\n\n* HBL\n* Meezan Bank Limited\n* MCB Bank Limited\n* National Bank of Pakistan\n* United Bank\n* Allied Bank\n\n\n## Panama[edit]\n\n\n* Banco General\n* Banistmo\n* Banco Nacional\n* BAC Credomatic\n\n\n## Peru[edit]\n\n\nIn Peru the \"big four\" are:[50]\n\n\n\n* Banco de Cr\u00e9dito del Per\u00fa\n* BBVA Per\u00fa\n* Scotiabank (a subsidiary of the Canadian bank)\n* Interbank\n\n\n## Philippines[edit]\n\n\nThe term \"Big Four\" is not explicitly used in the Philippines.

It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves. The firm is headquartered at 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building at 270 Park Avenue in 2025.\n\n\nThe firm's early history can be traced to 1799, with the founding of what became the Chase Manhattan Company. In 1871, J.P. Morgan & Co. was founded by J. P. Morgan who launched the House of Morgan on 23 Wall Street as a national purveyor of commercial, investment, and private banking services. The present company was formed after the two predecessor firms merged in 2000, creating a diversified holding entity. It is a major provider of investment banking services, through corporate advisory, mergers and acquisitions, sales and trading, and public offerings. Their private banking franchise and asset management division are among the world's largest in terms of total assets. Its retail banking and credit card offerings are provided via the Chase brand in the U.S. and United Kingdom.\n\n\nWith US $3.9\u00a0trillion in total assets,[8] JPMorgan Chase is the fifth-largest bank in the world by assets. The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The JPMorgan Chase logo prior to the 2008 rebranding\n![](image)As of June 2008, the JPMorgan logo used for the company's Investment Banking, Asset Management, and Treasury & Securities Services units[11]\nJPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies that merged since 1996, combining Chase Manhattan Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., and Bank One, as well as asset assumptions of Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and First Republic. Predecessors include additional historic, major banking firms, among which are Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago Bank, National Bank of Detroit, Texas Commerce Bank, Providian Financial and Great Western Bank. The company's oldest predecessor institution, The Bank of the Manhattan Company, was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799, by Aaron Burr.[12]\n\n\n\n### Chase Manhattan Bank[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chase Manhattan Bank\n\n![](image)The logo used by Chase following the merger with the Manhattan Bank in 1954\nThe Chase Manhattan Bank was formed upon the 1955 purchase of Chase National Bank (established in 1877) by The Bank of the Manhattan Company (established in 1799),[13] the company's oldest predecessor institution. The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of Aaron Burr, who transformed the company from a water carrier into a bank.[14]\n\n\nAccording to page 115 of *An Empire of Wealth* by John Steele Gordon, the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase's history runs as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> At the turn of the nineteenth century, obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature. This, of course, injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. Hamilton's political enemy\u2014and eventual murderer\u2014Aaron Burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called The Manhattan Company to provide clean water to New York City. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States.[15]\n> \n> \n\n\nLed by David Rockefeller during the 1970s and 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banks, with leadership positions in syndicated lending, treasury and securities services, credit cards, mortgages, and retail financial services. Weakened by the real estate collapse in the early 1990s, it was acquired by Chemical Bank in 1996, retaining the Chase name.[16][17] Before its merger with J.P. Morgan & Co., the new Chase expanded the investment and asset management groups through two acquisitions. In 1999, it acquired San Francisco\u2013based Hambrecht & Quist for $1.35\u00a0billion.[18] In April 2000, UK-based Robert Fleming & Co. was purchased by the new Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7\u00a0billion.[19]\n\n\n\n### Chemical Banking Corporation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chemical Bank\n\nThe New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of various chemicals. In 1824, the company amended its charter to perform banking activities and created the Chemical Bank of New York. After 1851, the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, most notably with Corn Exchange Bank in 1954, Texas Commerce Bank (a large bank in Texas) in 1986, and Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company in 1991 (the first major bank merger \"among equals\"). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions. In 1984, Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity transactions alongside various financial sponsors. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of the pioneering investment banker, Jimmy Lee.[20][21] At many points throughout this history, Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of assets or deposit market share).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1996, Chemical Bank acquired Chase Manhattan. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, it took the better-known Chase name.[16][17] To this day, JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical's pre-1996 stock price history, as well as Chemical's former headquarters site at 270 Park Avenue (the current building was demolished and a larger replacement headquarters is being built on the same site).\n\n\n\n### J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: J.P. Morgan & Co.\n\n![](image)The J.P. Morgan & Co. logo before its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000\n![](image)Influence of J.P. Morgan in Large Corporations, 1914\n![](image)The J.P. Morgan headquarters in New York City following the September 16, 1920, bomb explosion that took the lives of 38 people and injured over 400 more\nThe House of Morgan was born out of the partnership of Drexel, Morgan & Co., which in 1895 was renamed J.P. Morgan & Co. (see also: J. Pierpont Morgan).[22] J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion dollar corporation.[23] In 1895, J.P. Morgan & Co. supplied the United States government with $62\u00a0million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100\u00a0million.[24] In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.[25]\n\n\nBuilt in 1914, 23 Wall Street was the bank's headquarters for decades.[26] On September 16, 1920, a terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank, injuring 400 and killing 38.[27] Shortly before the bomb went off, a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The case has never been solved, and was rendered inactive by the FBI in 1940.[28]\n\n\nIn August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the monopoly underwriter of war bonds for the UK and France. The Bank of England became a \"fiscal agent\" of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa.[29] The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France. The company profited from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.[29] Since the U.S. federal government withdrew from world affairs under successive isolationist Republican administrations in the 1920s, J.P. Morgan & Co. continued playing a major role in global affairs since most European countries still owed war debts.[30]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, J.P. Morgan & Co. and all integrated banking businesses in the United States were required by the provisions of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act to separate their investment banking from their commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank.[31]\n\n\nIn 1935, after being barred from the securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan spun off its investment-banking operations. Led by J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, Morgan Stanley was founded on September 16, 1935, with $6.6\u00a0million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners.[*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.[22] The bank would continue to operate as Morgan Guaranty Trust until the 1980s, before migrating back to the use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1984, the group purchased the Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette, Indiana. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.[32]\n\n\nThe Bank began operations in Japan in 1924,[33] in Australia during the later part of the nineteenth century,[34] and in Indonesia during the early 1920s.[35] An office of the Equitable Eastern Banking Corporation (one of J.P. Morgan's predecessors) opened a branch in China in 1921 and Chase National Bank was established there in 1923.[36] The bank has operated in Saudi Arabia[37] and India[38] since the 1930s. Chase Manhattan Bank opened an office in South Korea in 1967.[39] The firm's presence in Greece dates to 1968.[40] An office of JPMorgan was opened in Taiwan in 1970,[41] in Russia (Soviet Union) in 1973,[42] and Nordic operations began during the same year.[43] Operations in Poland began in 1995.[40]\n\n\n\n### Bank One Corporation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bank One Corporation\n\n![](image)Logo of Bank One\nIn 2004, JPMorgan Chase merged with Chicago-based Bank One Corp., bringing on board current chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon as president and COO.[44] He succeeded former CEO William B. Harrison Jr.[45] Dimon introduced new cost-cutting strategies, and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executives\u2014many of whom were with Dimon at Citigroup. Dimon became CEO in December 2005 and chairman in December 2006.[46] Bank One Corporation was formed with the 1998 merger of Banc One of Columbus, Ohio and First Chicago NBD.[47] This merger was considered a failure until Dimon took over and reformed the new firm's practices. Dimon effected changes to make Bank One Corporation a viable merger partner for JPMorgan Chase.[48]\n\n\nBank One Corporation, formerly First Bancgroup of Ohio, was founded as a holding company for City National Bank of Columbus, Ohio, and several other banks in that state, all of which were renamed \"Bank One\" when the holding company was renamed Banc One Corporation.[49] With the beginning of interstate banking they spread into other states, always renaming acquired banks \"Bank One.\" After the First Chicago NBD merger, adverse financial results led to the departure of CEO John B. McCoy, whose father and grandfather had headed Banc One and predecessors. JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of Bank One in the third quarter of 2004.[49]\n\n\n\n### Bear Stearns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bear Stearns\n\n![](image)The Bear Stearns logo\nAt the end of 2007, Bear Stearns was the fifth largest investment bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of the year.[50] On Friday, March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns lost 47% of its equity market value as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend, it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove insolvent, and on March 15, 2008, the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns.[51]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2008, after a weekend of intense negotiations between JPMorgan, Bear, and the federal government, JPMorgan Chase announced its plans to acquire Bear Stearns in a stock swap worth $2.00 per share or $240\u00a0million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days.[51] In the interim, JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all Bear Stearns trades and business process flows.[52] On March 18, 2008, JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of Bear Stearns for $236\u00a0million.[50] The stock swap agreement was signed that night.[53]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2008, after public discontent over the low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share.[50] Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns using newly issued shares at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board, representing another 10% of the share capital, that its members would vote in favor of the new deal. With sufficient commitments to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on May 30, 2008.[54]\n\n\n\n### Washington Mutual[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Washington Mutual\n\n![](image)The Washington Mutual logo prior to its 2008 acquisition by JPMorgan Chase\nOn September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most of the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That night, the Office of Thrift Supervision, in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations, and deposits to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $1.836\u00a0billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. \n\n\nHowever, Chase did not purchase any mortgages in the FDIC receivership as the loans had already been sold off into Washington Mutual-branded mortgage-backed securities long before the receivership happened on September 25, 2008. If Chase wanted ownership of any Washington Mutual mortgages, they had to purchase them from the FDIC by way of a Receiver's Deed or Bill of Sale. This could not occur, as there were no mortgages on Washington Mutual Bank's books at time of receivership. Any recorded Assignments of Mortgage claiming that Chase was \"successor in interest\" and that the transfer occurred \"by operation of law,\" would be incorrect. The FDIC was \"successor in interest\" to Washington Mutual Bank. Chase's purchase of the bank from the FDIC was for Washington Mutual Bank only and it occurred by a Purchase & Assumption Agreement[55] and not \"by operation of law\" from the receivership.\n\n\nAs a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their equity.[56]\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase raised $10\u00a0billion in a stock sale to cover writedowns and losses after taking on deposits and branches of Washington Mutual.[57] Through the acquisition, JPMorgan now owns the former accounts of Providian Financial, a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005. The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009.[*citation needed*] Chief executive Alan H. Fishman received a $7.5\u00a0million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6\u00a0million after being CEO for 17 days.[58][*importance?*]\n\n\n\n### First Republic Bank[edit]\n\n\nMain article: First Republic Bank\n\nOn May 1, 2023, in what was now the second largest bank failure behind JPMorgan's acquisition of Washington Mutual fifteen years earlier, the company acquired \"the substantial majority of assets\" and inherited the deposits of First Republic Bank. Under terms disclosed by JPMorgan Chase & Co., it will make a $10.6 billion payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, return $25 billion in funds that other banks deposited with First Republic in March in a lifeline negotiated with the US Department of Treasury at that time, and will eliminate a $5 billion deposit it had made with First Republic.[59] As a result of the takeover, First Republic Bank shareholders lost all their equity.\n\n\nThe FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be about $13 billion.[60]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, JPMorgan Chase purchased Collegiate Funding Services, a portfolio company of private equity firm Lightyear Capital, for $663\u00a0million. CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans, previously known as Chase Education Finance.[61]\n\n\nIn April 2006, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bank of New York Mellon's retail and small business banking network. The acquisition gave Chase access to 339 additional branches in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.[62] In 2008, J.P. Morgan acquired the UK-based carbon offsetting company ClimateCare.[63] JPMorgan Chase was the biggest bank at the end of 2008 as an individual bank (exclusive of its subsidiaries) during the 2008 financial crisis.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 2008\u20132009[edit]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2008, $25 billion in funds were transferred from the U.S. Treasury Department to JPMorgan Chase, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[65] This was the fifth largest amount transferred under Section A of TARP[66] to help troubled assets related to residential mortgages. It has been widely reported[67] that JPMorgan Chase was in much better financial shape than other banks and did not need TARP funds but accepted the funds because the government did not want to single out only the banks with capital issues. JPMorgan Chase stated in February 2009 that it would be using its capital-base monetary strength to acquire new businesses.[68]\n\n\nBy February 2009, the U.S. government had not moved forward in enforcing TARP's intent of funding JPMorgan Chase with $25 billion.[65] In the face of the government's lack of action, Jamie Dimon was quoted during the week of February 1, 2009, as saying:\n\n\n\n\n> JPMorgan would be fine if we stopped talking about the damn nationalization of banks. We've got plenty of capital. To policymakers, I say where were they?\u00a0... They approved all these banks. Now they're beating up on everyone, saying look at all these mistakes, and we're going to come and fix it.[69][70]\n> \n> \n\n\nJPMorgan Chase was arguably the healthiest of the nine largest U.S. banks and did not need to take TARP funds. In order to encourage smaller banks with troubled assets to accept this money, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson allegedly coerced the CEOs of the nine largest banks to accept TARP money under short notice.[71]\n\n\nIn November 2009, J.P. Morgan announced it would acquire the balance of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, an advisory and underwriting joint venture established in 2004 with the Cazenove Group.[72] Earlier in 2011, the company announced that by the use of field-programmable gate array-based supercomputers, the time taken to assess risk had been greatly reduced, from arriving at a conclusion within hours to what is now minutes.[73] In 2013, J.P. Morgan acquired Bloomspot, a San Francisco-based startup. Shortly after the acquisition, the service was shut down and Bloomspot's talent was left unused.[74][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2013[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, after teaming up with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline and Children's Investment Fund, JPMorgan Chase, under Dimon launched a $94 Million fund with a focus on \"late-stage healthcare technology trials\". The \"$94 million Global Health Investment Fund will give money to final-stage drug, vaccine, and medical device studies that are otherwise stalled at companies because of their relatively high failure risk and low consumer demand. Examples of problems that could be addressed by the fund include malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and maternal and infant mortality, according to the Gates and JPMorgan Chase led-group\".[76]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nThe 2014 JPMorgan Chase data breach, disclosed in September 2014, compromised the JPMorgan Chase accounts of over 83 million customers. The attack was discovered by the bank's security team in late July 2014, but not completely halted until the middle of August.[77][78]\n\n\nIn October 2014, J.P. Morgan sold its commodities trader unit to Mercuria for $800 million, a quarter of the initial valuation of $3.5 billion, as the transaction excluded some oil and metal stockpiles and other assets.[79]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2016, J.P. Morgan decided not to finance coal mines and coal power plants in wealthy countries.[80] In December 2016, 14 former executives of the Wendel investment company faced trial for tax fraud while JPMorgan Chase was to be pursued for complicity. Jean-Bernard Lafonta was convicted December 2015 for spreading false information and insider trading, and fined 1.5 million euros.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Lawrence Obracanik, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. employee, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that he stole more than $5 million from his employer to pay personal debts.[82] In June 2017, Matt Zames, then-COO of the bank, decided to leave the firm.[83] In December 2017, J.P. Morgan was sued by the Nigerian government for $875 million, which Nigeria alleges was transferred by J.P. Morgan to a corrupt former minister.[84] Nigeria accused J.P. Morgan of being \"grossly negligent\".[85]\n\n\n\n#### 2019[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, J.P. Morgan announced the launch of JPM Coin, a digital token that will be used to settle transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business.[86] It would be the first cryptocurrency issued by a United States bank.[87]\n\n\n\n#### 2021[edit]\n\n\nOn April 19, 2021, JP Morgan pledged $5\u00a0billion towards the European Super League.[88][89] a controversial breakaway group of football clubs seeking to create a monopolistic structure where the founding members would be guaranteed entry to the competition in perpetuity. They funded the failed attempt to create the league, which, if successful, would have ended the meritocratic European pyramid soccer system. J.P. Morgan's role in the creation of the Super League was instrumental; the investment bank was reported to have worked on it for several years.[90] After a strong backlash, the owners/management of the teams that proposed creating the league pulled out of it.[91] After the attempt to end the European football hierarchy failed, J.P. Morgan apologized for its role in the scheme.[90] JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the company \"kind of missed\" that football supporters would respond negatively to the Super League.[92] While the absence of promotion and relegation is a common sports model in the US, this is an antithesis to the European competition-based pyramid model and has led to widespread condemnation from Football federations internationally as well as at government level.[93] However, even at the time, JPMorgan had been involved in European football for almost 20 years. In 2003, they advised the Glazer ownership of Manchester United. It also advised Rocco Commisso, the owner of Mediacom, to purchase ACF Fiorentina, and Dan Friedkin on his takeover of A.S. Roma. Moreover, It aided Inter Milan and A.S. Roma to sell bonds backed by future media revenue, and Spain's Real Madrid CF to raise funds to refurbish their Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.[94]\n\n\nIn September 2021, JPMorgan Chase entered the UK retail banking market by launched an app-based current account under the Chase brand. This is the company's first retail banking operation outside of the United States.[95][96][97] In 2021, the company made more than over 30 acquisitions including OpenInvest and Nutmeg.[98][99] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that would acquire Global Shares, a cloud-based provider of share plan software management.[100][101] In November 2021, JPMorgan Chase acquired restaurant recommendation website and owner of Zagat, The Infatuation.[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, JPMorgan Chase was ranked 24 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue.[104] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced to wind down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.[105]\n\n\nOn May 20, 2022, JPMorgan Chase used blockchain for collateral settlements, the latest Wall Street experimentation with the technology in the trading of traditional financial assets.[106]\n\n\nIn September 2022, the company announced it was acquiring California-based Renovite Technologies to expand its payments processing business amid heavy competition from fintech firms like Stripe and Adyen. This comes on top of previous, similar moves of buying a 49% stake in fintech Viva Wallet and a majority sake in Volkswagen's payments business, among many other acquisitions in other areas of finance.[107][108][109]\n\n\nIn November 2022, JPMorgan Chase sent COO Daniel Pinto to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong.[110] The attendance of US financial executives drew heavy criticism from some US lawmakers, who had previously urged the US financial executives to cancel their attendance to the summit.[111][112]\n\n\n\n#### 2023[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2023, *CNBC* reported JPMorgan Chase was developing a new tool for investment advisers using artificial intelligence called IndexGPT. Via trademark filing, this would rely on a \"disruptive form of artificial intelligence\" and cloud computing software to select investments for customers. This move was a sign the bank intended to launch a product in the near term, given the requirements around filing, and it came amid a flurry of development around ChatGPT and this technology from financial institutions. This came amid a period of job cuts, including for technology roles, even as the company emphasize its commitment to AI and created a model to detect potential changes in Federal Reserve policy.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and legal settlements by years[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

In 2005, Chase paid $2.2\u00a0billion to settle a lawsuit filed by investors in Enron.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2002[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2002, Chase paid fines totaling $80\u00a0million, with the amount split between the states and the federal government. The fines were part of a settlement involving charges that ten banks, including Chase, deceived investors with biased research. The total settlement with the ten banks was $1.4\u00a0billion. The settlement required that the banks separate investment banking from research, and ban any allocation of IPO shares.[119]\n\n\n\n### 2005[edit]\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase, which helped underwrite $15.4\u00a0billion of WorldCom's bonds, agreed in March 2005 to pay $2\u00a0billion; that was 46 percent, or $630\u00a0million, more than it would have paid had it accepted an investor offer in May 2004 of $1.37\u00a0billion. J.P. Morgan was the last big lender to settle. Its payment is the second largest in the case, exceeded only by the $2.6\u00a0billion accord reached in 2004 by Citigroup.[120] In March 2005, 16 of WorldCom's 17 former underwriters reached settlements with the investors.[121][122] In 2005, JPMorgan Chase acknowledged that its two predecessor banks had received ownership of thousands of slaves as collateral prior to the Civil War. The company apologized for contributing to the \"brutal and unjust institution\" of slavery.[123][124] The bank paid $5 million in reparations in the form of a scholarship program for Black students.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n### 2009[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, 14 lawsuits were filed against JPMorgan Chase in various district courts on behalf of Chase credit card holders claiming the bank violated the Truth in Lending Act, breached its contract with the consumers, and committed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The consumers contended that Chase, with little or no notice, increased minimum monthly payments from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based on the promise of a fixed interest rate. In May 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.[128]\n\n\nIn November 2009, a week after Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Larry Langford was convicted for financial crimes related to bond swaps for Jefferson County, Alabama,[*importance?*] JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to a $722\u00a0million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe into the sales of derivatives that allegedly contributed to the near-bankruptcy of the county. JPMorgan had been chosen by the county commissioners to refinance the county's sewer debt, and the SEC had alleged that JPMorgan made undisclosed payments to close friends of the commissioners in exchange for the deal and made up for the costs by charging higher interest rates on the swaps.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2010[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, J.P. Morgan Securities was fined a record \u00a333.32\u00a0million ($49.12\u00a0million) by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) for failing to protect an average of \u00a35.5\u00a0billion of clients' money from 2002 to 2009.[130][131] FSA requires financial firms to keep clients' funds in separate accounts to protect the clients in case such a firm becomes insolvent. The firm had failed to properly segregate client funds from corporate funds following the merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan, resulting in a violation of FSA regulations but no losses to clients. The clients' funds would have been at risk had the firm become insolvent during this period.[132] J.P. Morgan Securities reported the incident to the FSA, corrected the errors, and cooperated in the ensuing investigation, resulting in the fine being reduced 30% from an original amount of \u00a347.6\u00a0million.[131]\n\n\n\n### 2011[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, JPMorgan Chase admitted that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed on more than a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active-duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was \"grim\" and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back.[133] Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27\u00a0million in compensation to settle the class-action suit.[134] At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed. In June 2011, lending chief Dave Lowman was forced out over the scandal.[135][136]\n\n\nOn August 25, 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to settle fines with regard to violations of the sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regime.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] The U.S. Department of Treasury released the following civil penalties information under the heading: \"JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Settles Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs\":[*importance?*]\n\n\n\n\n> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, New York, NY (\"JPMC\") has agreed to remit $88,300,000 to settle a potential civil liability for apparent violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (\"CACR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 515; the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations (\"WMDPSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 544; Executive Order 13382, \"Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters;\" the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (\"GTSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 594; the Iranian Transactions Regulations (\"ITR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 560; the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations (\"SSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 538; the Former Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor Sanctions Regulations (\"FLRCTSR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 593; and the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations (\"RPPR\"), 31 C.F.R. part 501, that occurred between December 15, 2005, and March 1, 2011.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aU.S. Department of the Treasury Resource Center, OFAC Recent Actions. Retrieved June 18, 2013.[137]\n> \n\n\n### 2012[edit]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[138] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[139] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.\n\n\nIn 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co was charged for misrepresenting and failing to disclose that the CIO had engaged in speculative trades that exposed JPMorgan to significant losses.[140]\n\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2013, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a stipulation and consent agreement under which JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation (JPMVEC), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to pay $410 million in penalties and disgorgement to ratepayers for allegations of market manipulation stemming from the company's bidding activities in electricity markets in California and the Midwest from September 2010 through November 2012.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] JPMVEC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $285 million to the U.S. Treasury and to disgorge $125 million in unjust profits. JPMVEC admitted the facts set forth in the agreement, but neither admitted nor denied the violations.[141] The case stemmed from multiple referrals to FERC from market monitors in 2011 and 2012 regarding JPMVEC's bidding practices. FERC investigators determined that JPMVEC engaged in 12 manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants that were usually out of the money in the marketplace. In each of them, the company made bids designed to create artificial conditions that forced California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (ISOs) to pay JPMVEC outside the market at premium rates.[141] FERC investigators further determined that JPMVEC knew that the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO received no benefit from making inflated payments to the company, thereby defrauding the ISOs by obtaining payments for benefits that the company did not deliver beyond the routine provision of energy. FERC investigators also determined that JPMVEC's bids displaced other generation and altered day ahead and real-time prices from the prices that would have resulted had the company not submitted the bids.[141] Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed FERC to detect, prevent, and appropriately sanction the gaming of energy markets. According to FERC, the Commission approved the settlement as in the public interest.[141]\n\n\nFERC's investigation of energy market manipulations led to a subsequent investigation into possible obstruction of justice by employees of JPMorgan Chase.[142] Various newspapers reported in September 2013 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Attorney's Office in Manhattan were investigating whether employees withheld information or made false statements during the FERC investigation.[142] The reported impetus for the investigation was a letter from Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, in which they asked FERC why no action was taken against people who impeded the FERC investigation.[142] At the time of the FBI investigation, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was also looking into whether JPMorgan Chase employees impeded the FERC investigation.[142] Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase was facing over a dozen investigations at the time.[142]\n\n\nBernie Madoff opened a business account at Chemical Bank in 1986 and maintained it until 2008, long after Chemical acquired Chase.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] In 2010, Irving Picard, the SIPC receiver appointed to liquidate Madoff's company, alleged that JPMorgan Chase failed to prevent Madoff from defrauding his customers. According to the suit, Chase \"knew or should have known\" that Madoff's wealth management business was a fraud. However, Chase did not report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it notified the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency. Picard argued that even after Morgan's investment bankers reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, Chase's retail banking division did not put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.[143] The receiver's suit against JPMorgan Chase was dismissed by the Court for failing to set forth any legally cognizable claim for damages.[144] In the fall of 2013, JPMorgan Chase began talks with prosecutors and regulators regarding compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer banking regulations in connection with Madoff.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn August 2013, JPMorgan Chase announced that it was being investigated by the United States Department of Justice over its offerings of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. The company said that the Department of Justice had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during the period 2005 to 2007.[145] On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities.[146] Of that amount, $9 billion was penalties and fines, and the remaining $4 billion was consumer relief. This was the largest corporate settlement to date. Conduct at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to their 2008 acquisitions accounted for much of the alleged wrongdoing. The agreement did not settle criminal charges.[147]\n\n\n\n### 2014[edit]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2014, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $2.05 billion in fines and penalties to settle civil and criminal charges related to its role in the Madoff scandal.[*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*] The government filed a two-count criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase with Bank Secrecy Act violations, but the charges would be dismissed within two years provided that JPMorgan Chase reforms its anti-money laundering procedures and cooperates with the government in its investigation. The bank agreed to forfeit $1.7 billion. The lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of shareholders against chief executive Jamie Dimon and other high-ranking JPMorgan Chase employees, used statements made by Bernie Madoff during interviews conducted while in prison in Butner, North Carolina claiming that JPMorgan Chase officials knew of the fraud. The lawsuit stated that \"JPMorgan was uniquely positioned for 20 years to see Madoff's crimes and put a stop to them ... But faced with the prospect of shutting down Madoff's account and losing lucrative profits, JPMorgan \u2013 at its highest level \u2013 chose to turn a blind eye.\"[148][*neutrality is disputed*] JPMorgan Chase also agreed to pay a $350 million fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and settle the suit filed against it by Picard for $543 million.[149][150][151][152]\n\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $264 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges involving a systematic bribery scheme spanning 2006 to 2013 in which the bank secured business deals in Hong Kong by agreeing to hire hundreds of friends and relatives of Chinese government officials, resulting in more than $100 million in revenue for the bank.[153]\n\n\n\n### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, the United States sued the company, accusing it of discriminating against \"thousands\" of black and Hispanic mortgage borrowers between 2006 and at least 2009.[154][155]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nOn December 26, 2018, as part of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into abusive practices related to American depositary receipts (ADRs), JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $135 million to settle charges of improper handling of \"pre-released\" ADRs without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. The sum consisted of $71 million in ill-gotten gains plus $14.4 million in prejudgment interest and an additional penalty of $49.7 million.[156]\n\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\nOn May 14, 2020, *Financial Times*, citing a report which revealed how companies are treating employees, their supply chains and other stakeholders, during the COVID-19 pandemic, documented that J.P. Morgan Asset Management alongside Fidelity Investments and Vanguard have been accused of paying lip services to cover human rights violations. The UK based media also referenced that a few of the world's biggest fund houses took the action in order to lessen the impact of abuses, such as modern slavery, at the companies they invest in. J.P. Morgan, in responding to the report, said that it took \"human rights violations very seriously\" and \"any company with alleged or proven violations of principles, including human rights abuses, is scrutinized and may result in either enhanced engagement or removal from a portfolio.\"[157]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the company admitted that it manipulated precious metals futures and government bond markets in a span period of eight years. It settled with the United States Department of Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for $920 million. J.P. Morgan will not face criminal charges, however, it will launch into a deferred prosecution agreement for three years.[158]\n\n\n\n### 2022\u20132023[edit]\n\n\nOn November 24, 2022, two women who accused Jeffrey Epstein of sex trafficking and sexual abuse also sued JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, accusing them of benefiting and closing their eyes to Epstein's sex trafficking operations. According to the lawsuits, banks knew that Epstein's accounts were used to finance sex trafficking crimes.[159][160] In June 2023, after the allegations reached class-action status, the parties reached a settlement, with JPMorgan agreeing to pay $290\u00a0million.[161]\n\n\nIn September 2023, JPMorgan agreed to a $75 million settlement with the United States Virgin Islands Department of Justice for its alleged facilitation and failure to notify law enforcement of Epstein's illegal activities.[162]\n\n\n\n## Financial data[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | 25.87 | 31.15 | 33.19 | 29.34 | 29.61 | 33.19 | 42.74 | 54.25 | 62.00 | 71.37 | 67.25 | 100.4 | 102.7 | 97.23 | 97.03 | 96.61 | 94.21 | 93.54 | 95.67 | 99.62 | 109.03 | 115.40 | 119.54 | 121.65 | 128.69\n |\n| Net income | 4.745 | 7.501 | 5.727 | 1.694 | 1.663 | 6.719 | 4.466 | 8.483 | 14.44 | 15.37 | 5.605 | 11.73 | 17.37 | 18.98 | 21.28 | 17.92 | 21.76 | 24.44 | 24.73 | 24.44 | 32.47 | 36.43 | 29.13 | 48.33 | 37.68\n |\n| Assets | 626.9 | 667.0 | 715.3 | 693.6 | 758.8 | 770.9 | 1,157 | 1,199 | 1,352 | 1,562 | 2,175 | 2,032 | 2,118 | 2,266 | 2,359 | 2,416 | 2,573 | 2,352 | 2,491 | 2,534 | 2,623 | 2,687 | 3,386 | 3,743 | 3,666\n |\n| Equity | 35.10 | 35.06 | 42.34 | 41.10 | 42.31 | 46.15 | 105.7 | 107.2 | 115.8 | 123.2 | 166.9 | 165.4 | 176.1 | 183.6 | 204.1 | 210.9 | 231.7 | 247.6 | 254.2 | 255.7 | 256.5 | 261.3 | 279.4 | 294.1 | 292.3\n |\n| Capitalization |  |  |  |  |  | 75.03 | 138.7 | 138.4 | 167.2 | 147.0 | 117.7 | 164.3 | 165.9 | 125.4 | 167.3 | 219.7 | 232.5 | 241.9 | 307.3 | 366.3 | 319.8 | 429.9 | 387.5 |  |  |\n| Headcount |  |  |  |  |  | 96.37 | 161.0 | 168.8 | 174.4 | 180.7 | 225.0 | 222.3 | 239.8 | 260.2 | 259.0 | 251.2 | 241.4 | 234.6 | 243.4 | 252.5 | 256.1 | 257.0 | 255.4 | 271.0 | 293.7\n |\n\n\n**Note**: Financial data in billions of US dollars and employee data in thousands.

JPMorgan's giving has been focused on Republicans, with 62 percent of its donations going to GOP recipients in 2014. 78 House Democrats received campaign cash from JPMorgan's PAC in the 2014 cycle at an average of $5,200 and a total of 38 of the Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill took money from JPMorgan's PAC in 2014. JPMorgan Chase's PAC made maximum donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the leadership PACs of Steny Hoyer and Jim Himes in 2014.[187]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that they had committed a five-year $20 million commitment in support of summer youth employment programs (SYEPs) across 24 cities in the United States. This commitment came as part of the organisations wider $30 billion commitment to drive inclusive economic recovery and increase opportunities for underserved communities. The latest commitment will place funds to local governments, employers, and community partners to aid in giving young people access to SYEPs and gain experience to help in building careers.[188]\n\n\n\n## Climate change[edit]\n\n\nJPMorgan has come under criticism for investing in new fossil fuels projects since the Paris climate change agreement. From 2016 to the first half of 2019 it provided $75 billion (\u00a361 billion) to companies expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration.[189] According to Rainforest Action Network its total fossil fuel financing was $64 billion in 2018, $69 billion in 2017 and $62 billion in 2016.[190] From 2015, which is when the Paris Agreement was adopted, until 2021, JP Morgan Chase provided $317 billion in fossil fuel financing; 33% more than any other bank.[191] On October 21, 2021, JP Morgan Chase joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance,[192] which supports \"the global transition of the real economy to net-zero emissions.\"[193]\n\n\nAn internal study, 'Risky business: the climate and macroeconomy', by bank economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray was leaked in early\u20112020.[*importance?*] The report, dated 14\u00a0January 2020, states that under our current unsustainable trajectory of climate change \"we cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened\". JPMorgan subsequently distanced itself from the content of the study.[194]\n\n\nIn May 2023, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would purchase $200 million in carbon credits representing 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from multiple companies (including Climeworks and Charm Industrial) after announcing the previous month that it would join the Frontier CDR initiative formed by Alphabet Inc., McKinsey & Company, Meta Platforms, Shopify, and Stripe, Inc. under a $925 million advance market commitment to the CDR industry the previous year.[list 1]\n\n\n\n## Offices[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the old Chase Manhattan Bank's headquarters were at One Chase Manhattan Plaza (now 28 Liberty Street) in Lower Manhattan, the current temporary world headquarters for JPMorgan Chase & Co. are located at 383 Madison Avenue. In 2018, JPMorgan announced they would demolish the current headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue, which was Union Carbide's former headquarters, to make way for a newer building at 270 Park Avenue that will be 681 feet (208\u00a0m) taller than the previous building. Demolition was completed in the spring of 2021, and the new building will be completed in 2025. The replacement 1,388 feet (423\u00a0m) and 70-story headquarters will contain 2,500,000 square feet (230,000\u00a0m2), and will be able to fit 15,000 employees, whereas the current building fits 6,000 employees in a space that has a capacity of 3,500. The new headquarters is part of the East Midtown rezoning plan.[201] When construction is completed in 2025, the headquarters will then move back into the new building at 270 Park Avenue. As the new headquarters is replaced, the bulk of North American operations take place in five nearby buildings on or near Park Avenue in New York City: the former Bear Stearns Building at 383 Madison Avenue (just south of 270 Park Avenue), the former Chemical Bank Building at 277 Park Avenue just to the east, 237 Park Avenue, and 390 Madison Avenue.\n\n\nApproximately 11,050 employees are located in Columbus at the McCoy Center, the former Bank One Corporation offices. The building is the largest JPMorgan Chase & Co. facility in the world and the second-largest single-tenant office building in the United States behind The Pentagon.[202] The bank moved some of its operations to the JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston, when it purchased Texas Commerce Bank.[*citation needed*] The Global Corporate Bank's main headquarters are in London, with regional headquarters in Hong Kong, New York and S\u00e3o Paulo.[203]\n\n\nThe Card Services division has its headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, with Card Services offices in Elgin, Illinois; Springfield, Missouri; San Antonio, Texas; Mumbai, India; and Cebu, Philippines. Additional large operation centers are located in Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California, Newark, Delaware; Orlando, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Jacksonville, Florida; Brandon, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Brooklyn, New York; Rochester, New York; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Plano, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Operation centers in Canada are located in Burlington, Ontario; and Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\nAdditional offices and technology operations are located in Manila, Philippines; Cebu, Philippines; Mumbai, India; Bangalore, India; Hyderabad, India; New Delhi, India; Buenos Aires, Argentina; S\u00e3o Paulo; Mexico City, Mexico, and Jerusalem, Israel. In late 2017, JPMorgan Chase opened a new global operations center in Warsaw, Poland.[204] The Asia Pacific headquarters for JPMorgan is located in Hong Kong at Chater House.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOperations centers in the United Kingdom are located in Bournemouth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Liverpool, and Swindon. The London location also serves as the European headquarters.\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Temporary World Headquarters 383 Madison Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Temporary World Headquarters  \n383 Madison Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![JPMorgan Chase World Headquarters (under construction) 270 Park Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase World Headquarters (under construction)  \n270 Park Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![277 Park Avenue New York City, New York](image)\n\n277 Park Avenue  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![28 Liberty Street, New York City, New York](image)\n\n28 Liberty Street  \nNew York City, New York\n* ![Chase Tower Chicago, Illinois](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nChicago, Illinois\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Building San Francisco, California](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Building  \nSan Francisco, California\n* ![Chase Tower Dallas, Texas](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nDallas, Texas\n* ![Chase Tower Phoenix, Arizona](image)\n\nChase Tower  \nPhoenix, Arizona\n* ![JPMorgan Chase Tower Houston, Texas](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase Tower  \nHouston, Texas\n* ![25 Bank Street London, United Kingdom](image)\n\n25 Bank Street  \nLondon, United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO.[205][206] As of 2013 JPMorgan had the largest credit default swap and credit derivatives portfolio by total notional amount of any US bank.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### 2012 CDS trading loss[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss\n\nIn April 2012, hedge fund insiders became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of Bruno Iksil, a trader for JPMorgan Chase & Co., referred to as \"the London whale\" in reference to the huge positions he was taking. Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of J.P. Morgan, who purchased the derivatives offered by J.P. Morgan in such high volume.[209][210] Early reports were denied and minimized by the firm in an attempt to minimize exposure.[211] Major losses, $2 billion, were reported by the firm in May 2012, in relation to these trades and updated to $4.4 billion on July 13, 2012.[212] The disclosure, which resulted in headlines in the media, did not disclose the exact nature of the trading involved, which remained in progress as of June 28, 2012, and continued to produce losses which could total as much as $9 billion under worst-case scenarios.[213][214] In the end, the trading produced actual losses of only $6 billion. The item traded, possibly related to CDX IG 9, an index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations,[215][216] has been described as a \"derivative of a derivative\".[217][218] On the company's emergency conference call, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the strategy was \"flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored\".[219] The episode was investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the FBI.[220]\n\n\n\n\n\nFines levied regarding the 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss[221]\n| Regulator | Nation | Fine\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Office of the Comptroller of the Currency | US | $300m\n |\n| Securities and Exchange Commission | $200m\n |\n| Federal Reserve | $200m\n |\n| Financial Conduct Authority | UK | \u00a3138m ($220m US)\n |\n\n\nOn September 18, 2013, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $920 million in fines and penalties to American and UK regulators for violations related to the trading loss and other incidents. The fine was part of a multiagency and multinational settlement with the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. The company also admitted breaking American securities law.[222] The fines amounted to the third biggest banking fine levied by US regulators, and the second-largest by UK authorities.[221] As of September\u00a019, 2013[update], two traders face criminal proceedings.[221] It is also the first time in several years that a major American financial institution has publicly admitted breaking the securities laws.[223]\n\n\nA report by the SEC was critical of the level of oversight from senior management on traders, and the FCA said the incident demonstrated \"flaws permeating all levels of the firm: from portfolio level right up to senior management.\"[221] On the day of the fine, the BBC reported from the New York Stock Exchange that the fines \"barely registered\" with traders there, the news had been an expected development, and the company had prepared for the financial hit.[221]\n\n\n\n## Art collection[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: J. P. Morgan \u00a7\u00a0Collector of art, books, and gemstones\n\nThe collection was begun in 1959 by David Rockefeller,[224] and comprises over 30,000 objects, of which over 6,000 are photographic-based,[225] as of 2012 containing more than one hundred works by Middle Eastern and North African artists.[226] The One Chase Manhattan Plaza building was the original location at the start of collection by the Chase Manhattan Bank, the current collection containing both this and also those works that the First National Bank of Chicago had acquired prior to assimilation into the JPMorgan Chase organization.[227] L. K. Erf has been the director of acquisitions of works since 2004 for the bank,[228] whose art program staff is completed by an additional three full-time members and one registrar.[229] The advisory committee at the time of the Rockefeller initiation included A. H. Barr, and D. Miller, and also J. J. Sweeney, R. Hale, P. Rathbone and G. Bunshaft.[230]\n\n\n\n## Major sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Chase Field (formerly Bank One Ballpark), Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks, MLB\n* Chase Center, San Francisco, California \u2013 Golden State Warriors, NBA\n* Major League Soccer\n* Chase Auditorium (formerly Bank One Auditorium) inside of Chase Tower in Chicago, Illinois (formerly Bank One Tower)\n* The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge, owned and operated by JPMorgan Chase, is the largest corporate road racing series in the world with over 200,000 participants in 12 cities in six countries on five continents.

The acquisition deal of Bank One in 2004, was designed in part to recruit Dimon to JPMorgan Chase. He became chief executive at the end of 2005.[231] Dimon has been recognized for his leadership during the 2008 financial crisis.[232] Under his leadership, JPMorgan Chase rescued two ailing banks during the crisis.[233]\n\n\nAlthough Dimon has publicly criticized the American government's strict immigration policies, as of July 2018, his company has $1.6 million worth of stocks in Sterling Construction (the company contracted to build a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border).[234][235][*neutrality is disputed*]\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of May 1, 2023:[236]\n\n\n\n* Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase\n* Linda Bammann, former JPMorgan and Bank One executive\n* Steve Burke, chairman of NBCUniversal\n* Todd Combs, CEO of GEICO\n* James Crown, president of Henry Crown and Company\n* Alicia Boler Davis, CEO of Alto Pharmacy\n* Timothy Flynn, former chairman and CEO of KPMG\n* Alex Gorsky, former CEO and chairman of Johnson & Johnson\n* Mellody Hobson, CEO of Ariel Investments\n* Michael Neal, CEO of GE Capital\n* Phebe Novakovic, chairwoman and CEO of General Dynamics\n* Virginia Rometty, Executive Chairwoman of IBM, former chairwoman, president and CEO of IBM\n\n\n### Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* Chairman: Jamie Dimon (since January 2007)[237]\n* Chief Executive: Jamie Dimon (since January 2006)[237]\n\n\n#### List of former chairmen[edit]\n\n\n1.
