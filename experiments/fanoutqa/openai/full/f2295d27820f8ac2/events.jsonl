These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990.

It is among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of all dog breeds, with a weight of no more than 3.2 kg/7 pounds.[1] It originated in the nineteenth century in the English county of Yorkshire, for which it is named.[2] The coat is tan on the head and dark steel-grey on the body; no other colour is accepted by either The Kennel Club or the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.[1][3]\n\n\nIt is a playful and energetic dog, usually kept as a companion dog. It has contributed to the development of other breeds including the Silky Terrier, and also to cross-breeds such as the Yorkipoo.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Yorkshire Terrier from 1915\n![](image)Two Yorkshire Terriers—Mrs. Foster's \"Huddersfield Ben\" and Lady Giffard's \"Katie\" (c. 1870)\n![](image)A painting from the 19th century depicting a Yorkshire-like terrier by Ernest Gustave Girardot\nThe Yorkshire Terrier originated in Yorkshire. In the mid-nineteenth century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work and brought with them several varieties of terrier dogs. Breeding of the Yorkshire terrier was \"principally accomplished by the people – mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills – in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire.\"[4] In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a ratting terrier, bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers.[5]\n\n\nDetails are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as saying in 1886,[6]\n\n\n\n\n> If we consider that the mill operatives who originated the breed were nearly all ignorant men, unaccustomed to imparting information for public use, we may see some reason why reliable facts have not been easily attained.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe breed originates from two distinct dogs, a male named Old Crab, a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known.[7] The Paisley Terrier, a smaller version of the Skye Terrier that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat, also figured into the early dogs. Some authorities believed that the Maltese was used as well.[8] \"They were all originally bred from Scotch Terriers (meaning dogs from Scotland, not today's Scottish Terrier) and shown as such the name Yorkshire Terrier was given to them on account of their being improved so much in Yorkshire.\"[6]\n\n\nYorkshire Terriers were shown in a dog show category (class) at the time called \"Rough and Broken-coated, Broken-haired Scotch and Yorkshire Terriers\". Hugh Dalziel, writing in 1878, says that \"the classification of these dogs at shows and in the Kennel Club Stud Book is confusing and absurd\" in lumping together these different types.[9] In the early days of the breed, \"almost anything in the shape of a Terrier having a long coat with blue on the body and fawn or silver coloured head and legs, with tail docked and ears trimmed, was received and admired as a Yorkshire Terrier\".[4] But in the late 1860s, a popular Paisley-type Yorkshire Terrier show dog named Huddersfield Ben, owned by a woman living in Yorkshire, Mary Ann Foster, was seen at dog shows throughout Great Britain, and defined the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier.[10]\n\n\n\n### Huddersfield Ben[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Huddersfield Ben\n\nHuddersfield Ben was a Yorkshire Terrier whose portrait was painted by George Earl[11] and in 1891 an authority on the breed wrote, \"Huddersfield Ben was the best stud dog of his breed during his lifetime, and one of the most remarkable dogs of any pet breed that ever lived; and most of the show specimens of the present day have one or more crosses of his blood in their pedigree.\"[12] A show winner, Huddersfield Ben, through his puppies, helped define the Yorkshire Terrier breed. He is still referred to as \"father of the breed.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### In North America[edit]\n\n\nThe Yorkshire Terrier was introduced in North America in 1872[13] and the first Yorkshire Terrier was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885.[2][14] During the Victorian era, the Yorkshire Terrier was a popular pet, and show dog in England, and as Americans embraced Victorian customs, so too did they embrace the Yorkshire Terrier.[15] The breed's popularity dipped in the 1940s, when the percentage of small breed dogs registered fell to an all-time low of 18% of total registrations.[16] Smoky, a Yorkshire Terrier and famous war dog from World War II, is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the breed.[17] The AKC ranked the Yorkshire Terrier as the 6th most popular purebred in the United States in 2012 and 2013.[2]\n\n\n\n## Coat[edit]\n\n\nFor adult Yorkshire Terriers, The American Kennel Club places importance on coat colour, quality, and texture.[18] According to The Kennel Club (UK), the hair must be glossy, fine, straight, and silky. Traditionally the coat is grown out very long and is parted down the middle of the back, but \"must never impede movement.\".[19] The hair of the Yorkshire Terrier can be used to determine content of metals in the dog organism.[20]\n\n\nFrom the back of the neck to the base of the tail, the coat should be a dark grey to a black colour,[18] and the hair on the tail should be a darker black.[19] On the head, high chest and legs, the hair should be a bright, rich tan, darker at the roots than in the middle, that shades into a lighter tan at the tips, but not for all dogs. Also, in adult dogs there should be no black hairs intermingled with any of the tan-coloured fur.[18] The fine, straight, silky coat is considered hypoallergenic.\n\n\n\n* ![A silver-blue and pale cream Yorkshire Terrier, with characteristic long hair](image)\n\nA silver-blue and pale cream Yorkshire Terrier, with characteristic long hair\n* ![A silver-blue and pale cream Yorkshire Terrier.](image)\n\nA silver-blue and pale cream Yorkshire Terrier.\n* ![A Yorkshire Terrier with a dark coat](image)\n\nA Yorkshire Terrier with a dark coat\n* ![Golden Yorkie, judged as miscolour in normal Yorkshire breeding. The saddle is missing due to the recessive gene for red on the extension locus (see Dog coat genetics).](image)\n\nGolden Yorkie, judged as miscolour in normal Yorkshire breeding. The saddle is missing due to the recessive gene for red on the extension locus (see Dog coat genetics).\n\n\nAdult Yorkshire Terriers whose coat colours deviate from the standard, or that have woolly or extra fine coats, are still Yorkshire Terriers. The only difference is that it is not recommended to intentionally breed atypical Yorkshire Terriers.[21] In addition, care may be more difficult for \"woolly\" or \"cottony\" textured coats, or coats that are overly fine.[18] One of the reasons given for not breeding \"off-coloured\" Yorkies is that the colour could be a potential indicator of a genetic defect that may affect the dog's health; a careful health screening can clarify if any health risks exist.[21] Coats may vary in colour. For example, a mature Yorkie may have a silver-blue with light brown, while another might have a black and creamy colour.\n\n\nThe long coat on the Yorkshire Terrier requires regular brushing.[2]\n\n\n\n### Hypoallergenic coats[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hypoallergenic dog breed\n\nThe typical fine, straight, and silky Yorkshire Terrier coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic. In comparison with many other breeds, Yorkies do not shed to the same degree, losing small amounts when bathed or brushed.[22] The dog's dander and saliva typically trigger allergic reactions.[23] Allergists recognise that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that \"the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.\"[24] The Yorkshire Terrier coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken, or just said to not shed.[25] Although neither of those statements agree with what biologists, veterinarians, and allergists know about dog fur, allergists \"think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another\".[24]\n\n\n\n### Other colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Common origin of Biewer and particolour Yorkshire Terrier from purebred Blue and Tan Yorkshire Terriers with ancestors, that were carriers of the recessive Piebald gene.[26][27][28]\nThe Yorkshire Terrier is a tan dog with a blue saddle. Particolours exist, although they are not correct for the breed standard. The particolour coat is white with black-blue and tan. The white is caused by the recessive piebald gene. It is very rare to get a particolour, and if one is found, it tends to be very expensive.[29] Some Yorkshire Terriers are solid golden, they only produce pheomelanin, others are liver or chocolate, a brown colour; they produce brown eumelanin instead of black eumelanin.[30][31] The standard prescribes clearly defined fur-colours, and non-standard colours may indicate crossbreeding with other breeds or in rare cases even health problems.[21] The AKC registration form for Yorkshire Terriers allows for four choices: blue and tan, blue and gold, black and tan, black and gold. Colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet. Even though off-coloured Yorkshire Terriers are advertised at premium prices, being of an unusual or atypical colour is stated to be neither new, desirable, nor exotic.[29]\n\n\nMismatched Yorkshire Terriers should not be crossed with **Biewer Terriers**, a new breed that originated in Germany.[32] Although the AKC will not deny registration of a Yorkshire Terrier on colour alone, meaning that particolours are now registerable with the AKC, the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America has a directive that \"any solid colour or combination of colours other than black and tan\" for adult dogs is a disqualification, and \"dogs of solid colour, unusual combination of colours, and particolours should be disqualified.\"[33]\n\n\n\n### Puppy coats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Yorkshire Terrier puppy, displaying a black and tan coat\nIt may take three or more years for the coat to reach its final colour. The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour.[33] P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, \"and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner\" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.[34][35]\n\n\n\n### Coat care[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Yorkshire Terrier after a day at the groomer\nOwners may trim the hair short for easier care. For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed.[18][19] The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily (a bristle brush for short and shaved coat and a pin brush for long coat). In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in rice paper, tissue paper or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is \"well greased\" with coconut oil, the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are \"carefully kept in stockings\".[36]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Yorkshire Terrier character is described as \"conveying an important air\". According to the standard, the dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" has been described by the Kennel Club as having a \"carriage very upright conveying an important air\".[19] Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very protective, curious, and fond of attention. If trained correctly, these dogs are very child-friendly, easygoing, and like to be played with.\n\n\nYorkshire Terriers are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance. They are naturally smart and quick to learn with many being food and/or praise motivated. Because they were developed as a working breed, many need a lot of both physical and mental stimulation—with both long walks/runs but also indoor games and training to keep their mind busy. They are known for being yappy, but many have reported that a contented Yorkie is a quiet one—that will happily curl up on your knee in the evening. But they are all individuals, with some being much more laid back than others, and the breeder should ideally be able to advise on the needs and temperaments of their particular line. Yorkies are easily adaptable to all surroundings, travel well, and make suitable pets for many homes. Due to their small size, they require limited exercise but need daily interaction with people. They thrive on attention and love. Many are more timid around other dogs and prefer to stay close to their humans for comfort.[2]\n\n\nYorkshire Terriers do tend to bark a lot. This makes them excellent watchdogs, as they will sound the alarm when anyone gets close. A barking problem can often be resolved with proper training and exercise.\n\n\nYorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in Stanley Coren's *The Intelligence of Dogs*.[37]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nHealth issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include bronchitis, lymphangiectasia, portosystemic shunt, cataracts, and keratitis sicca.[38] Additionally, Yorkies often have a delicate digestive system, with vomiting or diarrhoea resulting from consumption of foods outside of a regular diet.[39] The relatively small size of the Yorkshire Terrier means that it usually has a poor tolerance for anaesthesia. Additionally, a toy dog such as the Yorkie is more likely to be injured by falls, other dogs, and owner clumsiness.[39] Injection reactions (inflammation or hair loss at the site of an injection) can occur. In addition, allergies can cause skin to be dry, itchy and/or red.[40]\n\n\nThe lifespan of a Yorkie is 12–15 years.[39][41] Undersized Yorkies (under 3 lb or 1.4 kg) generally have a shorter life span, as they are especially prone to health problems such as chronic diarrhoea and vomiting; are more sensitive to anaesthesia; and are more easily injured.[39]\n\n\n\n### Teeth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Morkie (half Maltese, half Yorkshire Terrier) puppy with his deciduous teeth and adult teeth growing in\nAs with all other dogs, Yorkies have two sets of teeth in their life. The first set of teeth is the 28-piece deciduous teeth (often referred to as \"milk teeth\", \"baby teeth\", or \"puppy teeth\"). The second set is the 42-piece permanent or adult teeth. Sometimes the number of permanent or adult teeth may vary, which is fine as long as they do not cause bad bite. When puppies are born, they have no teeth because milk is the only food they need. The deciduous teeth will grow from the age of 3 to 8 weeks old, in the order of incisors, canines, and premolars. Yorkie puppies have no molar teeth. Yorkie puppies will start to lose their deciduous or baby teeth when the permanent or adult teeth come in. The permanent or adult grow when the Yorkie puppies are 4 to 8 months old. By around 8 months old, those teeth should fully develop. The permanent or adult teeth will grow in the order of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Molar teeth will develop at around 6 to 8 months old.[42]\n\n\nYorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow. This is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth. (Usually, a puppy's body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth.) If the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth, it should be removed because it can cause a malocclusion or bad bite.[43] Retained teeth can cause tooth decay because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth. Sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite. The retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed. When necessary, the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Yorkshire Terrier's retained deciduous or baby fangs\nLike other small breeds, Yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease. Because they have a small jaw, their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally. This can cause food and plaque to build up, and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth, leading to periodontal disease. In addition, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems. The best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Human toothpaste is not recommended, because it foams more easily and may be swallowed. Professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems.[45]\n\n\n\n### Genetic defects[edit]\n\n\nCertain genetic disorders can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, including distichiasis, hydrocephalus, hypoplasia of dens, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, luxating patella, portosystemic shunt, retinal dysplasia, tracheal collapse, and bladder stones.[46] The following are among the most common congenital defects that affect Yorkies:\n\n\n\n* Distichiae, eyelashes arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the meibomian gland at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.[47] Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, corneal abrasions or corneal ulcers, and scarring. Treatment options may include manual removal, electrolysis, or surgery.[48]\n* Hypoplasia of dens is a non-formation of the pivot point of the second cervical vertebra, which leads to spinal cord damage.[46] Onset of the condition may occur at any age, producing signs ranging from neck pain to quadriplegia.[49]\n* Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, which causes the top of the femur (thigh bone) to degenerate, occurs in Yorkies in certain lines.[50] The condition appears to result from insufficient circulation to the area around the hip joint. As the blood supply is reduced, the bone in the head of the femur collapses and dies and the cartilage coating around it becomes cracked and deformed.[50] Usually the disease appears when the Yorkie is young (between five and eight months of age); signs are pain, limping or lameness.[51] The standard treatment is surgery to remove the affected part of the bone.[51] Following surgery, muscles hold the femur in place and fibrous tissue forms in the area of removal to prevent bone rubbing on bone.[52] Although the affected leg will be slightly shorter than prior to surgery, the Yorkie may regain almost normal use.[51]\n* Luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps) are another common defect considered to be genetic in Yorkies, although it may also be caused by an accidental fall. Weak ligaments and tendons in the knee or malformed (too shallow) patellar grooves, allow the patella to slip out of its groove sideways.[53] This causes the leg to 'lock up' with the foot held off the ground.[53] A dog with this problem may experience frequent pain and lameness, or may be bothered by it only on occasion. Over time, the patellar ridges can become worn down, making the groove even more shallow and causing the dog to become increasingly lame.[53] Surgery is the main treatment option available for luxating patellas, although it is not necessary for every dog with the condition. The severity of luxating patellas are on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe. Many dogs will not develop past a stage 1 or 2.\n* Portosystemic shunt, a congenital malformation of the portal vein (which brings blood to the liver for cleansing), is also common in Yorkies. In this condition some of the dog's blood bypasses the liver and the \"dirty\" blood goes on to poison the heart, brain, lungs and other organs with toxins. A Yorkie with this condition might exhibit a wide variety of symptoms, such as small stature, poor appetite, weak muscle development, decreased ability to learn, inferior coordination, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, behavioral abnormalities, seizures (especially after a meal) and blindness, which could lead to a coma and death. Often, the shunt can be treated with surgery.[54]\n\n\n![](image)Tracheal collapse\n* Tracheal collapse, caused by a progressive weakening of the walls of the trachea, occurs in many toy breeds, especially very tiny Yorkies.[55] As a result of genetics, the walls of the trachea can be flaccid, a condition that becomes more severe with age. Cushing's syndrome, a disorder that causes production of excess steroid hormone by the adrenal glands, can also weaken cartilage and lead to tracheal collapse.[56] There is a possibility that physical strain on the neck might cause or contribute to trachea collapse. Since this is usually caused by an energetic Yorkie pulling against his collar, many veterinarians recommend use of a harness for leashed walks.[55] An occasional \"goose honking\" cough, especially on exertion or excitement, is usually the first sign of this condition.[55] Over time, the cough may become almost constant in the Yorkie's later life. Breathing through the obstruction of a collapsed (or partially collapsed) trachea for many years can result in complications, including chronic lung disease. The coughing can be countered with cough suppressants and bronchodilators.[55] If the collapse is advanced and unresponsive to medication, sometimes surgery can repair the trachea.[55]\n\n\n### Hypoglycaemia[edit]\n\n\nLow blood sugar in puppies, or transient juvenile hypoglycaemia, is caused by fasting (too much time between meals).[57] In rare cases, hypoglycaemia may continue to be a problem in mature, usually very small, Yorkies. It is often seen in Yorkie puppies at 5 to 16 weeks of age.[57] Very tiny Yorkie puppies are especially predisposed to hypoglycaemia because a lack of muscle mass makes it difficult to store glucose and regulate blood sugar.[57] Factors such as stress, fatigue, a cold environment, poor nutrition, and a change in diet or feeding schedule may bring on hypoglycaemia.[58] Low blood sugar can also be the result of a bacterial infection, parasite or portosystemic liver shunt.[59] Hypoglycaemia causes the puppy to become drowsy, listless (glassy-eyed), shaky, uncpoglycaemic attack, the puppy usually has very pale or grey gums.[60] The puppy also may not eat unless force-fed.[57] Hypoglycaemia and dehydration seem to go hand-in-hand, and force-feeding or injecting fluids may also be necessary. Additionally, a hypoglycaemic Yorkie may have a lower than normal body temperature and, in extreme cases, may have a seizure or go into a coma.[61] A dog showing symptoms should be given sugar in the form of corn syrup or Nutri-Cal and be treated by a veterinarian immediately, as prolonged or recurring attacks of hypoglycaemia can permanently damage the dog's brain.[61] In severe cases, it can be fatal.[57]\n\n\n\n### Docking and Cropping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Docking (dog)\n\nTraditionally, the Yorkshire Terrier's tail is docked to a medium length.[62] Opposition to this practice began very early in the history of the breed; Hugh Dalziel, writing about Yorkshire Terriers in 1878, declared that \"There is no reason for mutilating pet dogs, and perfect ears and tails should be bred, not clipped into shape with scissors.\"[9] AKC and Canadian Kennel Club still require the Yorkie's tail be docked in order to compete at its events. The majority of the rest of the world has adopted a \"no docking/no cropping\" rule. Often, a Yorkshire Terrier's dewclaws, if any, are removed in the first few days of life,[18] another controversial practice.\n\n\n\n* ![A Yorkshire Terrier, trimmed](image)\n\nA Yorkshire Terrier, trimmed\n* ![A Yorkshire Terrier in need of brushing](image)\n\nA Yorkshire Terrier in need of brushing\n* ![A Yorkshire Terrier with a dark coat](image)\n\nA Yorkshire Terrier with a dark coat\n* ![A Yorkshire Terrier with floppy uncropped ears](image)\n\nA Yorkshire Terrier with floppy uncropped ears\n* ![According to the standard, the ears must be small, V-shaped, carried erect and set not too far apart.

If this is not the case, the dog should not be used for breeding\n* ![Two Yorkshire Terriers with short hair from the back](image)\n\nTwo Yorkshire Terriers with short hair from the back\n\n\n## Similar breeds and crosses[edit]\n\n\nThe Yorkshire Terrier breed descends from larger but similar Scottish breeds, such as the Skye Terrier and the now-extinct Paisley Terrier. In its turn, other breeds have been created from the Yorkshire Terrier, such as the Silky Terrier. Demand for unusual pets has resulted in high prices being paid for Yorkshire Terriers crossed with various other breeds, which are described with a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from Yorkshire Terrier and the breed name of the other parent. Some of these such portmanteau-named crosses can be found on the list of dog crossbreeds.\n\n\nTwo other breeds that look similar to the Yorkshire Terrier and have shorter hair are the prick-eared Norwich Terrier, along with its drop-eared relative the Norfolk Terrier. Another is the Biewer Terrier, which derives from the Yorkshire Terrier. The Biewer Terrier, bred from blue, white and gold puppies named Schneeflocke and Schneeflöckchen von Friedheck,[63][64][65] owned by Mr. and Mrs. Biewer in Germany,[66] was once considered a variation of the Yorkshire Terrier but has since been recognised as a separate breed by many kennel clubs, including the AKC.[67]\n\n\n\n## Notability[edit]\n\n\n### Show dogs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Yorkshire terrier being exhibited at a show\n* In 1997, Champion Ozmilion Mystification became the first Yorkie to win Best in Show at Crufts, the world's largest annual dog show.[68][69]\n\n\n### Small dogs[edit]\n\n\n* Sylvia, a matchbox-sized Yorkshire Terrier owned by Arthur Marples of Blackburn, England, was the smallest dog in recorded history.

Wynne adopted Smoky while he was serving with the 5th Air Force in the Pacific.[72]\n\n\n### White House dogs[edit]\n\n\n* Pasha, Tricia Nixon Cox's pet Yorkie, lived in the White House during Richard Nixon's presidency.[73]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Yorkshire Terrier.\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yorkshire Terrier.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.\n\n\nIt was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max von Stephanitz, the founder of the breed (with Horand von Grafrath), circa 1900\n![](image)Illustration from 1909\nDuring the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6] In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]\n\n\nTo combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[6] The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[6] some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[7] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.\n\n\nWith the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[6] At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[6] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[6] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[6]\n\n\nIn 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.[6] Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.[5] After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).[5] Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.[6] In just a few decades of the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.[8]\n\n\nHorand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and Württemberg.[6] Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.[6][9] Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.[6] This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.[6] Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.[10]\n\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.[8] German Shepherds were coveted as \"*germanische Urhunde*\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.[11] Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.[12] Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'Führerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover.[11] Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.[13] Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.[14] German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.[15]\n\n\nWhen the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[16] But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[17][18] The reputation of the German Shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.[19] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.[20]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sable bitch (left) and dog (right)\nThe breed was named *Deutscher Schäferhund*, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".[21] At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as *Altdeutsche Schäferhunde*, or old German herding dogs.\n\n\nThe direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity,[22] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[23] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\",[22] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[6]\n\n\nEventually,[*when?*] the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped,[22] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[6] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[22] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[24] The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skeleton in the Museum of Veterinary Anatomy of São Paulo, Brazil\nGerman Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[26] The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.[27][28][29] German Shepherds can reach sprinting speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.[30]\nShepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[31] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[28]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[28][31][32] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[33]\n\n\nMost commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic \"saddle\" to an overall \"blanket\". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[31]\n\n\n\n* ![Saddle black-and-tan coat](image)\n\nSaddle black-and-tan coat\n* ![Black mask and sable](image)\n\nBlack mask and sable\n* ![Solid black](image)\n\nSolid black\n* ![Bi-colour](image)\n\nBi-colour\n* ![Long-haired black-and-tan](image)\n\nLong-haired black-and-tan\n\n\n### Intelligence[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[34] In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.[35] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[36]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A human infant with two dogs\nGerman Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[31] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.[37] They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[38] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[39]\n\n\n\n### Aggression and biting[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dog bite prevention\n\nA 2020 literature review in *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery* found that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.[40]\n\n\nWhile an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[41] once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of attacks by German Shepherds drops to 38th.[42]\n\n\nAccording to the National Geographic Channel television show *Dangerous Encounters*, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238 lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180–1,460 newtons (265–328 lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235 lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230 lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86 lbf)).[43]\n\n\n\n## Modern breed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A common breed club's goal for German Shepherd body conformity, criticised by the UK Kennel Club\nThe modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.[44]: 6[45] He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.[6]\n\n\n\n### Controversy[edit]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.[46][47] Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.\n\n\nThe issue was raised in the BBC documentary, *Pedigree Dogs Exposed*, which said that critics of the breed describe it as \"half dog, half frog\". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were \"not normal\".\n\n\nThe Kennel Club's position is that \"this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement.\"[46] The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalise dogs with these problems.[48]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### East-European Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: East-European Shepherd\n\n![](image)East-European Shepherd\nThe East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd. It lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of German Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.[51]\n\n\n\n### King Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe King Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.[52]\n\n\n\n### Shiloh Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of back, temperament and soundness of hips.[53][54] It has been recognised since 1990 by the American Rare Breed Association.[55]\n\n\n\n### White Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Shepherd\n\n![](image)White Shepherd\nThe White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club.[56]\n\n\n\n### White Swiss Shepherd Dog[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Swiss Shepherd Dog\n\n![](image)White Swiss Shepherd Dog\nThe White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: *Berger Blanc Suisse*, German: *Weisser Schweizer Schäferhund*, Italian: *Pastore Svizzero Bianco*) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what was to become the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 2003, and it is now recognised by a number of national kennel clubs.[56]\n\n\n\n## Use as a working dog[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.[57] They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[58] German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft[59] or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.[6] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[6]\n\n\nThe German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.[58]\nAt one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.[60] An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.[61]\n\n\nCurrently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[62] The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom trains some German Shepherds,[63] while the comparable organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds.[64]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\nOne Mexican German Shepherd, Zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the Sedena's \"Narco Museum\" in Mexico. He is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in Mexican police and military history.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![German night-watchman with dog, 1950](image)\n\nGerman night-watchman with dog, 1950\n* ![Swedish police dogs, 2007](image)\n\nSwedish police dogs, 2007\n* ![Rescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001](image)\n\nRescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001\n* ![Military dog during training](image)\n\nMilitary dog during training\n\n\n## Numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this section **deal primarily with the United Kingdom and the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\nPopularity increased again after Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to have another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment.[67] Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of 2016[update], the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US.[67][68] It is typically among the most frequently registered breeds in other countries.[67] It was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020,[69] and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.[70]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMany common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practised early in the breed's life.[71] One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis.[72] A study conducted by the University of Zurich found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used.[73] The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia.[74] There are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play.[75] German Shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands.[76] According to a recent survey in the UK, the median life span of German Shepherds is 10.95 years,[77] which is normal for a dog of their size.\n\n\nDegenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. A very inexpensive DNA saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. The test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. A small study in the UK showed 16% of young asymptomatic German Shepherds to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers.[78] Now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. The test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on DNA samples from any dog, collected through swabbing the inside of the animal's cheek with a sterile cotton swab. Prospective German Shepherd buyers can now request the test from the breeder or buy from a breeder who is known to test their dogs.[79]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a higher-than-normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder,[80] and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. It is estimated that 1% of the UK population of German Shepherds has this disease.[81] Treatment is usually provided in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.\n\n\n\n### Skeletal health and supplementation[edit]\n\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events.[82] Some breeds like the German Shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis.[83][84] These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.\n\n\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopaedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, inflammation, lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint.[83][85] German Shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.[84]\n\n\nOsteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect German Shepherds.[86][87] Mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.[86][88]\n\n\nFeeding a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the German Shepherd to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health is essential.[82] Dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the German Shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms.[82] Several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows:\n\n\nAppropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like Canine Hip Dysplasia.[82] Furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure.[82] Imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications.[82] Excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to hypocalcaemia and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development.[82] In extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.[82]\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of cartilage catabolism in *in vitro* models, suggesting that its supplementation in food could aid in decreasing the symptoms of osteoarthritis in German Shepherds.[89] Furthermore, EPA and DHA inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders.[88] Ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes.[82] Animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.[88]\n\n\nGlucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of glucose.[87] Natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints.[82] However, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required.[82] Clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in German Shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing.[90] Anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation.[90] Similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.[82]\n\n\nVitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism.[82] Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German Shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.[82]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Strongheart, one of the earliest canine stars (1921)\nGerman Shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media.[91]\nIn 1921 Strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by Rin Tin Tin, who is considered[*by whom?*] the most famous German Shepherd. Both have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[92]\n\n\nBatman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound appeared in the Batman comic books, initially in 1955,[93] through 1964.[94] From 1964 onwards, his appearances have been sporadic.\n\n\nA German Shepherd named Inspector Rex is the star of an Austrian Police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where German Shepherd Rex assists the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit.[95] The show was aired in many languages.[96]\n\n\nKántor [hu] was a famous and very successful police dog in Hungary in the 1950s and early 1960s. After his death his story was fictionalised by two crime novels by Rudolf Szamos [hu], titled Kántor Investigates [hu] and *Kántor in the Big City*. A five-part thriller series for television titled *Kántor* was produced in 1975, which was loosely based on the actual dog's story, setting the events more than a decade after the real Kántor died. It became one of the staple productions of Hungarian television history, making German Shepherds the most popular dog breed in the country ever since. The taxidermy mount of Kántor's body is on display at the Police Museum in Budapest.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Notable individual German Shepherds[edit]\n\n\n* The dog on which the breed was founded\n\t+ Horand von Grafrath (January 1, 1895 – after 1899), considered the first German Shepherd and the genetic basis for modern German Shepherds\n* In film, television and fiction\n\t+ Strongheart (1 October 1917 – 24 June 1929), featured in Hollywood films of 1921–1927\n\t+ Rin Tin Tin (September 1918 – 10 August 1932), Rin Tin Tin Jr., and Rin Tin Tin III, featured in Hollywood films of 1922–1947\n\t+ Thunder the Dog (7 September 1921 – after October 1928), featured in Hollywood films of 1923–1927\n\t+ Silver Streak (born 1924), featured in Hollywood films of 1924–1928\n\t+ Lightning, grandson of Strongheart, featured in Hollywood films of 1934–1938\n\t+ Ace the Wonder Dog, featured in Hollywood films and serials of 1938–1946\n\t+ Rex the Wonder Dog, fictional superhero in the DC Comics universe 1952–present\n\t+ Ace the Bat-Hound, fictional partner of Batman in DC Comics 1955–present\n\t+ Joe, protagonist in the NBC television series *Run, Joe, Run* in 1974–1975\n\t+ Won Ton Ton, protagonist of the 1976 comedy film *Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood*, a spoof of Rin Tin Tin\n\t+ Koton, sometimes identified as Rando, police dog later featured in the 1989 film *K-9* with James Belushi\n\t+ Rex, protagonist of the Austrian-Italian comedy-drama television series *Inspector Rex* of 1994–2015, and remakes in other countries\n* Pets of political figures\n\t+ Blondi (1941 – 29 April 1945), Hitler's pet on which he tested the cyanide capsules he later consumed to commit suicide, killing her\n\t+ Champ (11 November 2008 – 19 June 2021), Commander (born 1 September 2021), and Major (born 17 January 2018), pets of US President Joe Biden\n\t+ Major, police dog later kept as a pet of United States president Franklin D.

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.\n\n\nThe Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.[2] It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buccleuch Avon, whelped in 1885\nThe Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. John's breed of these dogs[6][7] in the fifth edition of his book *Instructions to Young Sportsmen*, published in 1846.[7]\n\n\nBy 1870 the name Labrador Retriever had become common in England.[8] The liver (now usually called chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892;[9] the first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe).[10] The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903.[11] The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[12]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The head is broad with a pronounced stop.\n![](image)Black\n![](image)Chocolate\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.[2] Significant differences between UK and U.S. standards are noted.\n\n\n\n* **Size**: Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for dogs of 25–36 kg (55–80 lb) and for bitches as 25–32 kg (55–70 lb).[2] The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 55 to 62 centimetres (21.5 to 24.5 in) for dogs and 55 to 60 centimetres (21.5 to 23.5 in) for bitches,[2] The Kennel Club which advises that dogs should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5 in) with bitches between 55 and 56 centimetres (21.5 and 22 in),[13] and the FCI which quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5 in) for dogs with bitches ideal at 54 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22 in).[14]\n* **Coat**: The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to the water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.[15]\n* **Head**: The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and be set slightly above the eyes.\n* **Jaws**: The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.\n* **Body**: The body should have a powerful and muscular build.\n\n\nThe tail and coat are designated \"distinctive [or distinguishing] features\" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC.[2][13] The AKC adds that the \"true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### Colour[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Labrador Retriever coat colour genetics\n\n![three Labrador retrievers: Yellow, black, and chocolate](image)The three colour varieties, from front to back: Yellow, black, and chocolate\nLabradors are registered in three colours: Solid *black*, *yellow* (anything from creamy white to fox-red), and *chocolate* (medium to dark brown; originally called \"liver\").[16]\n\n\nPuppies of all colours can occur in the same litter. Coat colour is determined primarily by three genes, called *MC1R*, *Agouti*, and *CBD103*. If a dog carries wild type alleles at all three loci, the dog will have a yellow coat. If a dog has a loss-of-function mutation at MC1R, it will also have a yellow coat, regardless of the genotypes at the other two loci. Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for MC1R and Agouti, together with the black allele of CBD103, will have a black coat.[17][a]\n\n\nAccording to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245 Labradors studied were heterozygous for the M264V mutation responsible for the melanistic mask, and one was homozygous. Within this breed, the trait cannot be determined simply by appearance.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, and the rims of the eyes.\n### Show and field lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Head and muzzle appearance: field (left), and show (right), showing the shorter muzzle length, more solid appearance head, and \"pronounced\" stop of the latter\nAs a result of specialised breeding, there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States, the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"American\" and the latter as \"English\", in fact, both field and show types are bred in both countries and all Labrador Retrievers are descended from British lines.[19]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving shot game, a common wood pigeon\nLabrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study published in 2006, tested the suitability of four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) as guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and the Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Crossbreeds had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.[20][21]\n\n\nThe Labrador Retriever is a gun dog bred to retrieve on land and water.[22] As a dog specially bred for water retrieving, the labrador has developed various traits for this job. For retrieving the Labrador Retriever has a  soft mouth, a trait that allows it to carry game and waterfowl without damaging it.[23] And for swimming, the Labrador is aided by fully webbed paws, an otter-like tail, and a waterproof coat.[24]\n\n\nThe high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who was trained to, if need be, put his human who uses a wheelchair in the recovery position, cover him with a blanket, and activate an emergency phone.[25] A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.[26]\n\n\nThe breed is used in water rescue/lifesaving. It continues in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.[27]\n\n\n\n### In war[edit]\n\n\nLabradors have been used as war dogs. During the Vietnam War they were used as scout dogs to track down dead or wounded soldiers or enemy positions.[28]: 278\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nA Labrador may be expected to live for 10 to 12 years.[1]: 256\n\n\nIt is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity (most are missing all or parts of the appetite-regulating POMC gene).\n\n\nA Royal Veterinary College study, and one conducted by The University of Sydney, have concluded that chocolate-coloured Labradors have a shorter average life expectancy than other colours of Labrador (by about 10%) and are more likely to suffer some health problems.[29]\n\n\nLabradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia,[30] especially in larger dogs.[31] Eye diseases may include progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy[30] and retinal dysplasia.[32] They can suffer from exercise induced collapse, which causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise,[33] or from obesity, which in some cases may be partly due to the absence of part or all of the proopiomelanocortin gene.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of most popular dog breeds\n\nThe Labrador is an exceptionally popular dog. As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\nSeven out of the thirteen *\"outstanding gundogs\"* of the Australian National Kennel Council's 2000–2005 appointees to its 'hall of fame' are Labradors.[42]\n\n\n\n## Famous Labradors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Labradors\n\n![](image)Endal wearing his PDSA Gold Medal\nNotable labradors within various categories include:\n\n\n\n### Assistance dogs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assistance dog\n\n* Endal, a service dog[43] in Britain. Among other distinctions, \"the most decorated dog in the world\" (including \"Dog of the Millennium\" and the PDSA's Gold Medal for Animal Gallantry and Devotion to Duty), the first dog to ride on the London Eye and the first dog known to work a 'chip and pin' ATM card. By Endal's death in March 2009, he and his owner/handler Allen Parton had been filmed almost 350 times by crews from several countries, and a film of a year in Endal's life was in production.\n\n\n* Sully, served with former US President George H. W. Bush during the last six months of his life; noted for his role during the president's funeral. A form of Parkinson's disease confined the former president to a wheelchair or motorised scooter in the final years of his life. Among the services that Sully was able to perform for Bush were retrieving dropped items, opening and closing doors, pushing an emergency button and supporting him when standing.[44]\n\n\n### Police, military, rescue and detection dogs[edit]\n\n\n* Frida (12 April 2009 – 15 November 2022)[45] was a yellow Labrador Retriever who worked as a search and rescue dog for the Mexican Navy (SEMAR). She was deployed to help the rescue efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters.\n* Zanjeer (\"Chain\", or \"Shackles\"), a detection dog who detected arms and ammunition used in the 1993 Mumbai (Bombay) serial explosions.

Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for all three genes have a yellow coat resulting from Agouti antagonism of Mc1r signaling in melanocytes (yellow Great Dane, top). Dogs carrying a loss-of-function mutation at Mc1r have a yellow coat, regardless of their genotype at Agouti or CBD103 (yellow Labrador retriever, middle). Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for Mc1r and Agouti, together with the dominant black allele of CBD103 (KB) have a black coat resulting from the interaction between a β-defensin and Mc1r (black Curly Coated Retriever, bottom).\" — Candille, Kaelin, *et al.* (2007)[17]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nDennis-Bryan, Kim (2020) [2012]. *The Complete Dog Breed Book* (2nd ed.).

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.\n\n\nIt was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max von Stephanitz, the founder of the breed (with Horand von Grafrath), circa 1900\n![](image)Illustration from 1909\nDuring the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6] In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]\n\n\nTo combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[6] The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[6] some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[7] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.\n\n\nWith the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[6] At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[6] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[6] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[6]\n\n\nIn 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.[6] Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.[5] After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).[5] Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.[6] In just a few decades of the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.[8]\n\n\nHorand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and Württemberg.[6] Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.[6][9] Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.[6] This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.[6] Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.[10]\n\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.[8] German Shepherds were coveted as \"*germanische Urhunde*\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.[11] Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.[12] Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'Führerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover.[11] Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.[13] Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.[14] German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.[15]\n\n\nWhen the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[16] But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[17][18] The reputation of the German Shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.[19] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.[20]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sable bitch (left) and dog (right)\nThe breed was named *Deutscher Schäferhund*, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".[21] At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as *Altdeutsche Schäferhunde*, or old German herding dogs.\n\n\nThe direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity,[22] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[23] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\",[22] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[6]\n\n\nEventually,[*when?*] the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped,[22] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[6] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[22] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[24] The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skeleton in the Museum of Veterinary Anatomy of São Paulo, Brazil\nGerman Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[26] The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.[27][28][29] German Shepherds can reach sprinting speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.[30]\nShepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[31] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[28]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[28][31][32] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[33]\n\n\nMost commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic \"saddle\" to an overall \"blanket\". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[31]\n\n\n\n* ![Saddle black-and-tan coat](image)\n\nSaddle black-and-tan coat\n* ![Black mask and sable](image)\n\nBlack mask and sable\n* ![Solid black](image)\n\nSolid black\n* ![Bi-colour](image)\n\nBi-colour\n* ![Long-haired black-and-tan](image)\n\nLong-haired black-and-tan\n\n\n### Intelligence[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[34] In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.[35] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[36]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A human infant with two dogs\nGerman Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[31] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.[37] They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[38] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[39]\n\n\n\n### Aggression and biting[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dog bite prevention\n\nA 2020 literature review in *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery* found that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.[40]\n\n\nWhile an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[41] once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of attacks by German Shepherds drops to 38th.[42]\n\n\nAccording to the National Geographic Channel television show *Dangerous Encounters*, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238 lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180–1,460 newtons (265–328 lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235 lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230 lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86 lbf)).[43]\n\n\n\n## Modern breed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A common breed club's goal for German Shepherd body conformity, criticised by the UK Kennel Club\nThe modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.[44]: 6[45] He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.[6]\n\n\n\n### Controversy[edit]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.[46][47] Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.\n\n\nThe issue was raised in the BBC documentary, *Pedigree Dogs Exposed*, which said that critics of the breed describe it as \"half dog, half frog\". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were \"not normal\".\n\n\nThe Kennel Club's position is that \"this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement.\"[46] The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalise dogs with these problems.[48]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### East-European Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: East-European Shepherd\n\n![](image)East-European Shepherd\nThe East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd. It lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of German Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.[51]\n\n\n\n### King Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe King Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.[52]\n\n\n\n### Shiloh Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of back, temperament and soundness of hips.[53][54] It has been recognised since 1990 by the American Rare Breed Association.[55]\n\n\n\n### White Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Shepherd\n\n![](image)White Shepherd\nThe White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club.[56]\n\n\n\n### White Swiss Shepherd Dog[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Swiss Shepherd Dog\n\n![](image)White Swiss Shepherd Dog\nThe White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: *Berger Blanc Suisse*, German: *Weisser Schweizer Schäferhund*, Italian: *Pastore Svizzero Bianco*) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what was to become the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 2003, and it is now recognised by a number of national kennel clubs.[56]\n\n\n\n## Use as a working dog[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.[57] They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[58] German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft[59] or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.[6] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[6]\n\n\nThe German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.[58]\nAt one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.[60] An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.[61]\n\n\nCurrently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[62] The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom trains some German Shepherds,[63] while the comparable organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds.[64]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\nOne Mexican German Shepherd, Zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the Sedena's \"Narco Museum\" in Mexico. He is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in Mexican police and military history.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![German night-watchman with dog, 1950](image)\n\nGerman night-watchman with dog, 1950\n* ![Swedish police dogs, 2007](image)\n\nSwedish police dogs, 2007\n* ![Rescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001](image)\n\nRescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001\n* ![Military dog during training](image)\n\nMilitary dog during training\n\n\n## Numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this section **deal primarily with the United Kingdom and the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\nPopularity increased again after Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to have another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment.[67] Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of 2016[update], the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US.[67][68] It is typically among the most frequently registered breeds in other countries.[67] It was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020,[69] and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.[70]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMany common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practised early in the breed's life.[71] One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis.[72] A study conducted by the University of Zurich found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used.[73] The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia.[74] There are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play.[75] German Shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands.[76] According to a recent survey in the UK, the median life span of German Shepherds is 10.95 years,[77] which is normal for a dog of their size.\n\n\nDegenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. A very inexpensive DNA saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. The test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. A small study in the UK showed 16% of young asymptomatic German Shepherds to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers.[78] Now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. The test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on DNA samples from any dog, collected through swabbing the inside of the animal's cheek with a sterile cotton swab. Prospective German Shepherd buyers can now request the test from the breeder or buy from a breeder who is known to test their dogs.[79]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a higher-than-normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder,[80] and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. It is estimated that 1% of the UK population of German Shepherds has this disease.[81] Treatment is usually provided in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.\n\n\n\n### Skeletal health and supplementation[edit]\n\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events.[82] Some breeds like the German Shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis.[83][84] These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.\n\n\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopaedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, inflammation, lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint.[83][85] German Shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.[84]\n\n\nOsteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect German Shepherds.[86][87] Mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.[86][88]\n\n\nFeeding a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the German Shepherd to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health is essential.[82] Dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the German Shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms.[82] Several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows:\n\n\nAppropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like Canine Hip Dysplasia.[82] Furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure.[82] Imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications.[82] Excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to hypocalcaemia and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development.[82] In extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.[82]\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of cartilage catabolism in *in vitro* models, suggesting that its supplementation in food could aid in decreasing the symptoms of osteoarthritis in German Shepherds.[89] Furthermore, EPA and DHA inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders.[88] Ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes.[82] Animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.[88]\n\n\nGlucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of glucose.[87] Natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints.[82] However, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required.[82] Clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in German Shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing.[90] Anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation.[90] Similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.[82]\n\n\nVitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism.[82] Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German Shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.[82]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Strongheart, one of the earliest canine stars (1921)\nGerman Shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media.[91]\nIn 1921 Strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by Rin Tin Tin, who is considered[*by whom?*] the most famous German Shepherd. Both have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[92]\n\n\nBatman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound appeared in the Batman comic books, initially in 1955,[93] through 1964.[94] From 1964 onwards, his appearances have been sporadic.\n\n\nA German Shepherd named Inspector Rex is the star of an Austrian Police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where German Shepherd Rex assists the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit.[95] The show was aired in many languages.[96]\n\n\nKántor [hu] was a famous and very successful police dog in Hungary in the 1950s and early 1960s. After his death his story was fictionalised by two crime novels by Rudolf Szamos [hu], titled Kántor Investigates [hu] and *Kántor in the Big City*. A five-part thriller series for television titled *Kántor* was produced in 1975, which was loosely based on the actual dog's story, setting the events more than a decade after the real Kántor died. It became one of the staple productions of Hungarian television history, making German Shepherds the most popular dog breed in the country ever since.

The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.\n\n\nThe modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.\n\n\nBeagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently in film, television, and comic books.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Southern Hound is thought to be an ancestor of the beagle\nThe origin of the beagle is not known.[1] In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the St. Hubert Hound and the Talbot hound to Britain. In Britain, both of these strains were then crossed with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting.[2] Beagles are similar to the Harrier and the extinct Southern Hound, though they are smaller and slower.[1]\n\n\n\nFrom medieval times, *beagle* was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her *singing beagles* and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups.[3] 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's *Researches into the History of the British Dog* from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: \n\n\n> little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\nBy the 18th century, two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set, and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well-developed.[5]\n\n\nStandards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.[6]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern breed[edit]\n\n\nReverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in Essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded, it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; William Youatt suspected that Harriers formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure.[1] Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about 10 inches (25 cm) at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in *The Sportsman's Library* in 1845). Prince Albert and Lord Winterton also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favor no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Early images of the beagle (clockwise from top left): 1833, 1835, Stonehenge's Medium (1859, reusing Youatt's 1852 \"Beagle\" image) and Dwarf Beagle (1859).\nAlthough credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough-coated and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.[8]\n\n\nIn the 1840s, a standard beagle type was beginning to develop. The distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs.[9] In 1856, \"Stonehenge\" (the pseudonym of John Henry Walsh), writing in the *Manual of British Rural Sports*, was still dividing beagles into four varieties: the medium beagle; the dwarf or lapdog beagle; the fox beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish terrier breeds.[10] Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:\n\n\n\n\n> In size the beagle measures from 10 inches, or even less, to 15. In shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature, but with more neatness and beauty; and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting.[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nBy 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England.[11] The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time.[12] The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle.[13] By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.[11]\n\n\n\n### Export[edit]\n\n\nBeagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed, and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887.[14] The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885.[15] In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.[*further explanation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Popularity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An attractive uniform type for the breed developed at the start of the 20th century\nOn its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896.[12] The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.[16]\n\n\nAs purebred dogs, beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the Westminster Kennel Club's show and by 1939 a beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year.[17] On 12 February 2008, a beagle, K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno), won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history.[18] In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the American Kennel Club's registered breeds;[19] in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered.[20] In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively.[21] In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the Labrador Retriever (#1), German Shepherd (#2), and Golden Retriever (#3) breeds.[22]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from c. 1475 in *The Squire of Low Degree*. The origin of the word \"beagle\" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French *begueule* which means \"gate throat\".[23]\n\n\nIt is not known why the black and tan Kerry Beagle, present in Ireland since Celtic times, has the *beagle* description, since at 22 to 24 inches (56 to 61 cm) it is significantly taller than the modern day beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and drag hunting.[24]\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kennel Club (UK) standard states the beagle should give the impression of quality without coarseness.\nThe general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body.[25] They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average.[26]\nThey have a smooth, somewhat domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle, and a black (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong, and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth. Both sets align square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild, hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft, and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the \"stern\") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag, was bred for selectively, as the tail remains easily seen when the dog's head is down following a scent.[27] The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Beagle hound colours: Two-coloured \"tan and white\" (older female with fading colour), tricoloured broken, two-coloured \"red and white\", \"tricoloured\"\nThe tricolored beagle—white with large black areas and light brown shading—is the most common. Tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades, from the \"Classic Tri\" with a jet black saddle (also known as \"Blackback\"), to the \"Dark Tri\" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the \"Faded Tri\" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as *pied*. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some beagles gradually change colour during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.\n\n\nTwo-colour varieties always have a white base colour with areas of the second colour. Tan and white is the most common two-colour variety, but there is a wide range of other colours including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different coloured flecks (*ticking*), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue colour, similar to the colouring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolour beagles also have ticking of various colours in their white areas.[29][30]\n\n\nSaddle-patterned Beagles that express ancient domino (eA) are called hare-pied.[31] Domino restricts eumelanin production leading to a smaller and faded saddle. Dark hairs in the area of the saddle have a light-colored hair base. The nose pigment may be lightened down the middle.[32]\n\n\n\n## Sense of smell[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog.[33] In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all.[33] The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.[34]\n\n\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\n\n### Breed varieties[edit]\n\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognises two separate varieties of beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than 13 inches (33 cm), and the 15-inch for those between 13 and 15 inches (33 and 38 cm). The Canadian Kennel Club recognises a single type, with a height not exceeding 15 inches (38 cm). The Kennel Club (UK) and FCI affiliated clubs recognise a single type, with a height of between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm).\n\n\n\n![](image)A Puggle, a beagle/pug cross, shows traits from both breeds.\nEnglish and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard – which disallows animals over 15 inches (38 cm) – are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to 16 inches (41 cm).\n\n\nPocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is now not recognised by any Kennel Club.\n\n\nA strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Crossbreeds[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1850s, John Henry Walsh (Stonehenge) recommended a cross between a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.[37] More recently, the trend has been for \"designer dogs\" and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/Pug cross known as a Puggle. Some puppies of this cross are less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, similar to the Pug parent; but many are highly excitable and require vigorous exercise.[38]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beagles are happy to rest\nThe beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as \"merry\", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.[39][c]\n\n\nThey are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's *The Intelligence of Dogs*, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.[40][41]\nBeagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have become popular family pets. Beagles are pack animals; they are prone to separation anxiety,[42] a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended. Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as \"speaking\", \"giving tongue\", or \"opening\") when they catch the scent of potential quarry.[43] They also generally get along well with cats and other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.[44]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nThe typical longevity of beagles is 12–15 years,[45] which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size.[46]\n\n\nBeagles may be prone to epilepsy, but this can often be controlled with medication. Hypothyroidism and a number of types of dwarfism occur in beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: \"Funny Puppy\", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses;[47] and Musladin-Lueke syndrome (MLS) in which the eyes are slanted and the outer toes are underdeveloped but otherwise development is as normal.[48] Hip dysplasia, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in beagles.[49] Beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Weight gain can be a problem in older or sedentary dogs, which in turn can lead to heart and joint problems.\nIn rare cases, beagles may develop immune mediated polygenic arthritis (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments.[47] Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often, and do not have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.[51][52]\n\n\nTheir long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are glaucoma and corneal dystrophy.[53] \"Cherry eye\", a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid, and distichiasis, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery.[47] They can suffer from several types of retinal atrophy. Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.[47]\n\n\nAs field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight.[47] When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks, harvest mites, and tapeworms, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.[54]\n\n\nBeagles may exhibit a behavior known as reverse sneezing, in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behavior is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.[55]\n\n\n\n### Reproduction[edit]\n\n\nThe average size of a beagle litter is six puppies. When mother beagles give birth to litters of puppies, the little pups weigh just a few ounces each.[56]\n\n\n\n## Hunting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Beagling\n\n![](image)The Caynsham Foot Beagles (c. 1885)\nBeagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses.[57] Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together (\"so close that they might be covered with a sheet\"[1]) which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.[58]\n\n\nWith the fashion for faster hunts, the beagle fell out of favor for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In *Anecdotes of Dogs* (1846), Edward Jesse says:\n\n\n\n\n> In rabbit-shooting, in gorse and thick cover, nothing can be more cheerful than the beagle. They also are easily heard over long distances and in thick cover. They have been called rabbit-beagles from this employment, for which they are peculiarly qualified, especially those dogs which are somewhat wire-haired.[3]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Beagle has been used for rabbit-hunting since the earliest development of the breed.\nIn the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports.\nHunting hare with beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.\n\n\nThe traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt.\n\n\nAs hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British public schools traditionally maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today.[59] In 2001, the Wye College beagle pack was taken by the Animal Liberation Front.[60] School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University, and Christ Church, Oxford.[61]\n\n\nIn addition to organised beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare, cottontail rabbits, game birds, roe deer, red deer, bobcat, coyote, wild boar, and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt stoat.[62][63] In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.[62]\n\n\n\n## Detection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beagles have excellent noses; this dog is employed by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency.\nBeagles are used as detection dogs in the Beagle Brigade of the United States Department of Agriculture. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards.[64] They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and in Canada, Japan, and the People's Republic of China.[65] Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.[66]\n\n\n\n## Testing[edit]\n\n\nBeagles are the dog breed most often used in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. In the United States, as many as 65,000 beagles are used every year for medical, cosmetic, beauty, and other chemical tests. They are purpose bred and live their lives in cages undergoing experiments.[67] The Rescue + Freedom Project (formerly Beagle Freedom Project) has successfully advocated for beagles to be released from labs. This organisation has freed hundreds of animals.[68]\n\n\nBeagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals, or the environment.[69][70] Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%).[71] In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved.[72] In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%).[69] Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.[72]\n\n\n\n### Bans and activism against beagle testing[edit]\n\n\nTesting of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of the European Community,[73] although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted.[74] It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[75] When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing.[76] Minnesota was the first state to enact a Beagle Freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed research testing.[77]\n\n\nAnti-vivisection groups have reported on abuse of animals inside testing facilities. In 1997 footage secretly filmed by a freelance journalist inside Huntingdon Life Sciences in the UK showed staff punching and screaming at beagles.[78] Consort Kennels, a UK-based breeder of beagles for testing, closed down in 1997 after pressure from animal rights groups.[79]\n\n\nThere are various examples of activists utilizing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain information about taxpayer funding of animal testing. For example, the White Coat Waste Project, a group of activists that hold that taxpayers should not have to pay $20 billion every year for experiments on animals,[80] highlighted that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided $400,000 in taxpayer money to fund experiments in which 28 beagles were infected by disease-causing parasites.[81] [82] The White Coat Project found reports that said dogs taking part in the experiments were \"vocalizing in pain\" after being injected with foreign substances.[83] Following public outcry, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) made a call to action that all members of the National Institute of Health resign effective immediately[84] and that there is a \"need to find a new NIH director to replace the outgoing Francis Collins who will shut down research that violates the dignity of nonhuman animals.\"[85]\n\n\n\n## Other roles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Red & white Beagle\nAlthough bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets.[27]\n\n\nBeagles are used as sniffer dogs for termite detection in Australia,[86] and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection.[87][88] Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital.[89] In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number.[90] In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a Beagle search and rescue dog with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the Hôtel Montana, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble.[91] Beagles were hired by New York City to help with bedbug detection,[92] although some have expressed doubts about the role of such dogs in this type of detection.[93]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tricolor Beagle\n* Anthropomorphic Beagles appeared in comic strips and animated cartoons since the 1950s with the *Peanuts* character Snoopy, who was billed as \"the world's most famous Beagle\".[94] The animated series *Courage the Cowardly Dog* also features an anthropomorphic beagle as its title character.[95][*better source needed*]\n* Porthos is a beagle that belongs to Jonathan Archer, the captain on the television series *Star Trek: Enterprise*.\n* Former US President Lyndon Baines Johnson had several beagles, and caused an outcry when he picked up one of them by its ears during an official greeting on the White House lawn.[96]\n* The ship on which Charles Darwin made the voyage which provided much of the inspiration for *On the Origin of Species* was named HMS *Beagle* after the breed, and, in turn, lent its name to the ill-fated British Martian lander *Beagle 2*.\n* An American bred 15 inch male Beagle with the registered name of Ch K-Run's Park Me In First and the pet name of \"Uno\" won the 2008 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.[97]\n* A Canadian bred 15 inch female Beagle with the registered name of Gr Ch Tashtins Lookin For Trouble and the pet name of \"Miss P\" won the 2015 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.[98]\n\n\n## Notable Beagles[edit]\n\n\n* Frodo, awarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery\n* Uno, who in 2008 became the first Beagle to win the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show [99]\n* Miss P, winner of the 2015 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show [99]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**Informational notes**\n\n\n\n**a.** **^** In this article \"Beagle\" (with a capital B) is used to distinguish the modern breed from other beagle-type dogs.\n\n\n**c.** **^** The Harts posed the following question to a panel of 96 experts, half of which were veterinary surgeons and the other half dog obedience trial judges:  \n\n\n\n\n\n> A dog may normally be quite calm but can become very excitable when set off by such things as a ringing doorbell or an owner's movement toward the door.
