She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three songs on the chart, two of which are in the top forty.\n\n\nList of songs on *Billboard*'s 2005 Year-End Hot 100 chart[2]\n| No.\n | Title\n | Artist(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | \"We Belong

The song was released on March 15, 2005, through Island Records, as the second single from the album. \"We Belong Together\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00e1 Austin and produced by the former three. Since the song interpolates lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), the songwriters of those respective songs are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat. The lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return.\n\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful period between 2001 and 2004, critics dubbed the song her musical comeback, as many had considered her career over. \"We Belong Together\" earned her several music industry awards and nominations throughout 2005 and 2006. The song broke chart records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth topper on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen nonconsecutive weeks, it joined four other songs in a tie as the third longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's own 1995 collaboration with Boyz II Men titled \"One Sweet Day\". *Billboard* listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the fifteenth most popular song of all time. Additionally, it broke several airplay records, gathering both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history. \"We Belong Together\" also topped the charts in Australia; and reached the top-five in more than ten countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nThe song's music video was filmed as a two-part story with \"It's Like That\", which featured Carey at her bachelorette party. The video for \"We Belong Together\" is a continuation, focusing on Carey's wedding to a powerful older man and ending with the singer eloping with her younger ex-lover (played by actor Wentworth Miller of the TV show *Prison Break*). Rumors arose of the video's connection to her 1993 marriage to then-Sony Music CEO Tommy Mottola, as they did for Carey\u2019s 1997 video for the song \u201cHoney\u201d. Carey performed the song on several award shows and television appearances around the world, namely MTV Movie Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, Macy's Fourth of July Parade, *The Oprah Winfrey Show* and the 48th Grammy Awards. In Europe the song was performed at the Live 8 charity concert, the Fashion Rocks in Monaco, and the German Bambi Awards. Carey performed the song while on The Adventures of Mimi Tour and the song has been on every tour set list since then.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nCarey had produced back-to-back critically and commercially panned albums, *Glitter* (2001) and *Charmbracelet* (2002). Though fueled by strong media attention regarding Carey's return to music, as well as her new deal with Island Records, the albums failed to deliver the type of success she had been accustomed to throughout the 1990s, and only managed sales of 3 million copies globally.[1] After the album's release, and its succeeding tour, Carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project, eventually titled *The Emancipation of Mimi*, her tenth studio effort.[2] \"We Belong Together\" became a song that critics considered Carey's \"return to form\" and \"the return of the Voice\", after several questioned her vocal abilities following the release of *Charmbracelet*.[3]\n\n\nBy November 2004, Carey had already recorded several songs for *The Emancipation of Mimi*. Island Records chairman L.A. Reid suggested Carey that she compose a few more strong singles to ensure the project's commercial success. Believing that she had written some of her best work with Jermaine Dupri, Reid recommended her to meet with Dupri for a brief studio session. Carey headed to Atlanta to collaborate with Dupri where the duo wrote and produced \"Shake It Off\" and \"Get Your Number\", which were eventually released as the album's third and fourth singles. Following this recording session, \"Shake It Off\" was briefly selected as the album's lead single, replacing the originally planned \"Say Somethin'\".[4] Carey returned to Atlanta for a second meeting with Dupri; during this trip, Carey and Dupri penned the last two songs to be included on the album, \"We Belong Together\" and \"It's Like That\".[4] In an interview with *Billboard*, Carey described her sentiments regarding the song during the production stage:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> I had the chills. I had a great feeling about it when we finished writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I really felt something very special.[5]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nCarey and her management then decided to release \"It's Like That\", which Carey called \"the right fire-starter\", as the album's lead single.[4] She later reminisced about her experience with Dupri: \"I am so grateful I went to Atlanta,\" she said. \"And I have to say, we wrote some of my favorite songs on the album. I'm so proud of Jermaine \u2013 he's so focused, and he knew what had to be done.\"[4]\n\n\n\n## Music and structure[edit]\n\n\n\"We Belong Together\" is an R&B ballad.[6][7] *Rolling Stone* called it \"soulful.\"[8] The song is propelled by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music.[9] Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power, which would not have been achieved if she had belted.[4] The song also incorporates 1980s retro-soul music by \"cleverly\" referencing Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), with Babyface.[7] In the second verse of \"We Belong Together\", Carey sings: \"Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me, 'If you think you're lonely now'.\"[10] She then flips across a radio dial: \"So I turn the dial, tryin\u2019 to catch a break / And then I hear Babyface / 'I only think of you...'.\"[10] The line \"If you think you're lonely now\" is from the song of the same name and \"I only think of you\" is from the chorus of \"Two Occasions.\"[10] In the remix she also says \"I only think of you / On two occasions / That's day and night...\" Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs, the songwriters were given co-writing credits on the song.[7] \"We Belong Together\" follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections, with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions.[7] The first section chronicles the break-up of the couple, and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes.[10] In the second section, the narrative switches to the present, and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels \"all out of her element\" when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio, but fails.[6] \"We Belong Together\" does not have a bridge; instead, Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave, which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist.[6][11] *Metro Times* writer Johnny Loftus described the song's production, lyrics and vocals in detail:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> It\u2019s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads with her departed lover \u2013 'When you left I lost a part of me / It\u2019s still so hard to believe' \u2013 and the song\u2019s gentle R&B roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would \u2013 you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She\u2019s on a porch with tea; he\u2019s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There\u2019s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there\u2019s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect \u2013 and perfectly universal \u2013 pop/R&B songwriting. In other words, it\u2019s the jam. And there\u2019s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah\u2019s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song\u2019s title an emphatic.[6]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\"We Belong Together\" is a simple, understated musical arrangement set in C major and composed in 4/4 time.[11] Similarly, within the song, Carey's voice spans from G3 to the high note of A5. Carey's vocal range is demonstrated with a greater emphasis in the ending chorus, where the chorus is raised an octave higher, lying from G4 to A5.[11] As such, Carey ends with an anticipated coda, completing both the chorus and the song with a potent, belted note of C5 for approximately four semibreves (around 17 seconds).[11] It follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three sections that portray the protagonist in a range of emotions; from doleful and resigned in the first section, to desperate and agitated in the second.[12] In the last section the song climaxes with an octave raise, which not only emphasizes the protagonist's heightened desperation, but her determination to be with her lover.[12] The song is written in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute. Carey's vocals span from G3 to A5, and the song follows a chord progression of Am\u2013G\u2013Em\u2013F.[13]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | A-[14] |\n| *Stereogum* | 7/10[15] |\n\n\n\"We Belong Together\" became a \"career re-defining\"[16] song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.[17] Unlike most of Carey's recent singles at that time, \"We Belong Together\" received generally positive reviews from critics, most of whom hailed the song as her \"return to form\", following reviews for *Charmbracelet* (2002), that suggested Carey had lost her signature vocal range and power.[18] Sal Cinquemani of *Slant Magazine* wrote \"the... diva [keeps] cool with breathy, rapid-fire verses until the final full strong-voiced climax that... proves that 'The Voice' has indeed returned.\"[19] Additionally, he said that \"The song is as 'innovative' as Mariah has been in years.\"[19] Other critics commended Carey on her novel singing style which, according to Kelefa Sanneh of *The New York Times*, gave the song its propulsion, writing \"This style is part of the reason why she has been able to turn a ballad into a summer smash. 'We Belong Together' doesn't have a guest rapper, or a hard-hitting beat, but Ms. Carey's tricky vocal lines give the song more propulsion than you'd expect, with tightly coiled counter-rhythms that tug against the beat.\"[7] Johnny Loftus from *Metro Times* called it a \"summer hit\" and wrote \"We all know it\u2019s the intangibles that make a summer single anyway, those untraceable currents that grab the heart and feet, and despite not being an anthem, 'We Belong Together' is that rousing.\"[6]\n\n\nWriting for *Vibe*, Michael Ehrlich claimed the song would \"cut across generations\", while Cinquemani felt it would revive \"faith in Mariah the balladeer\".[9][20] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic chose \"We Belong Together\" as a \"top Pick\" from the album, while Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as \"beautifully cadenced\".[21][22] Echoing Cinquemani's comments about the song and Carey's past as a balladeer, Jozen Cummings from PopMatters wrote \"Carey makes the song her own, reminding fans of her 'Hero' days with full, throaty vocals and a crashing climax at the end. The dichotomy between 'The Emancipation of Mimi's' first two tracks is the album\u2019s bread and butter.\"[23] Since first hearing the song on the radio, Sherri Winston from *South Florida Sun-Sentinel* claimed she \"knew it would be a smash\", complimenting its understated beat and Carey's vocals.[24] *Billboard'*s Michael Paoletta described \"We Belong Together\" as one of the album's strongest cuts, claiming that it highlighted the strongest focal point on the song: Carey's voice.[25] Slant Magazine ranked it 2nd on their best songs of 2005 list.[19]\n\n\n\n## Chart performance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Carey performing \"We Belong Together\" on *Good Morning America*\nBetween 2001 and 2004, Carey's popularity had substantially declined and many had considered her career as over.[26] \"We Belong Together\" proved to be both Carey's comeback single and a massive commercial success. The song spent fourteen nonconsecutive weeks at number one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100\u2014after making its debut at number 81\u2014and fourteen consecutive weeks at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[27][28] It had major cross-over success, becoming the first song to simultaneously occupy the number one position on nine *Billboard* charts on the week ending August 6, 2005: the Hot 100, *Billboard* Hot 100 Airplay, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, Pop 100 Airplay, Top 40 Mainstream, Rhythmic Airplay Chart, Hot Dance Club Songs, and the Hot Ringtones charts.[29] Spending fourteen weeks atop the Hot 100, \"We Belong Together\" became the one of the third longest running number one songs in US chart history, behind only Carey's 1995 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent sixteen weeks at number one. Aside from its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Mediabase and Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in BDS history, reaching 32.8\u00a0million and 223 million impressions respectively. This record was held until it was broken by Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" in 2013, with 234.65 million listeners on July 28.[30][31]\n\n\nDuring the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\", held the number two spot.[27] Additionally, the song held the top position on the official Hot 100 Airplay chart for sixteen weeks, tying for the second all time spot with No Doubt's \"Don't Speak\" (1996).[27] \"We Belong Together\" was certified 4\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 4 million copies throughout the United States.[32] On the *Billboard* Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.[33] *Billboard* listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs[34] and second on Top Billboard Hot 100 R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[35] On the Hot 100, \"We Belong Together\" spent 23 consecutive weeks in the top ten and 43 weeks total on the chart, making it Carey's longest running top-ten song and her longest charting hit at the time. The song was also declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by *Billboard*,[36] which makes Carey the first artist to have more than one song being the most popular of a decade, as \"One Sweet Day\" was the most popular song of the 1990s.[37]\n\n\nBesides its success in the United States, \"We Belong Together\" achieved strong charting throughout Europe and Australia. On the ARIA Charts, the song debuted atop the singles chart in Australia during the week dated July 3, 2005.[38] The following week, it held the number one spot for a second week, and stayed on the chart for a total of eleven weeks.[38] To date, \"We Belong Together\" was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 units.[39] The song finished at number seventeen on the 2005 Australian Year-End Chart.[40] In both Flemish and Wallonian territories in Belgium, \"We Belong Together\" peaked at numbers twelve and twenty-four, spending a total of fifteen and fourteen weeks fluctuating in the singles chart, respectively.[41] The song finished at number forty-seven on the Flemish Year-End Chart of 2005.[42] \"We Belong Together\" made its debut at number fifteen on the Danish Tracklisten chart during the week of August 7, 2005, eventually peaking at number three.[43] In France, the song peaked at number twelve, and spent nineteen weeks fluctuating within the French singles chart.[44] On the Dutch Top 40 chart, \"We Belong Together\" reached number one in its fourth week, and spent a total of sixteen weeks in the chart, four of which were at the number two position.[45] The song finished at number forty-one on the Dutch Year-End Chart of 2005.[46] In New Zealand, the song spend three weeks at number two on the singles chart, and a total of twelve before making its exit on October 3, 2005.[47] At the end of 2005, \"We Belong Together\" finished at number thirty-six, and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).[48][49] In both Norway and Spain, the song peaked at number nine and three, and spent nine and seven weeks within the charts.[50][51] In Switzerland, the song peaked at number four on the official singles chart, and charted for thirteen weeks.[52] During mid-week predictions in the United Kingdom, \"We Belong Together\" was positioned to become Carey's third UK number one single.[53][54] However, it wound up debuting at number two on the UK Singles Chart.[55] In its second week, the song dropped to number three, before re-surfacing to number two in its third week, this time blocked by James Blunt's \"You're Beautiful\".[56] The song spent a total of eighteen weeks within the singles chart, and has estimated sales of over 240,000 units in the United Kingdom.[57]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\"We Belong Together\" was awarded several prestigious music industry awards throughout 2005 and 2006. At the 2005 Billboard Music Awards ceremony, Carey won five awards, with the song receiving awards in the \"Rhythmic Top 40 Title of the Year\", \"Hot 100 song of the Year\" and \"Hot 100 Airplay of the Year\" categories.[58][59] On November 6, 2005, Carey earned two awards for \"We Belong Together\" at the Radio Music Awards ceremony, in the \"Song of the Year/Mainstream Hit Radio\" and \"Song of the Year/Urban and Rhythmic Radio\" categories.[60] Similarly, \"We Belong Together\" won the \"Best R&B/Soul Single\" and \"Best R&B/Soul Single, Female\" awards at the 20th annual Soul Train Music Awards,[61] \"Choice Love Song\" at the Teen Choice Awards,[62] \"Best R&B Song\" at the Vibe Awards,[63] and \"World's Most-Played Single\" at the 2005 World Music Awards.[64]\n\n\nAt the 48th annual Grammy Awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium on February 8, 2006, Carey was nominated for eight awards, the most she had received in one night throughout her career.[65] \"We Belong Together\" was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year; however, it won two awards: \"Best R&B Song\" and \"Best Female R&B Vocal Performance\".[66] The song was named \"Song of the Year\" at the ASCAP Awards,[67] and \"Song of the Year\", \"Most Performed Song\" and \"Number-one Billboard Song\" at the BMI Awards.[68] Towards the summer of 2006, Carey took home \"Song of the Year\", \"Best Pop Female Song Performance\" and \"Best R&B/Soul Female Song Performance\" at the GrooveVolt Music & Fashion Awards.[69]\n\n\n\n## Remixes[edit]\n\n\nCarey recorded an official remix version for \"We Belong Together\", which she produced with DJ Clue.[10] The remix is recorded in D-Major (one step up from the original in C-Major) and Carey\u2019s vocals range from B3-E6. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, two-thirds of the hip-hop trio the LOX.[10] The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having \"a faster, springier backbeat\" by Kelefa Sanneh of *The New York Times*.[10] Lyrically, the song is similar to the album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories.[10] Styles P raps \"Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on\", which Sanneh writes \"Cheerfully out of place, he sounds like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it.\"[10] In two separate reviews of *The Emancipation of Mimi*, Sanneh referred to the song as both \"great\"[70] and \"excellent\",[7] in regards to the remix. \n\n\nAdditionally, the faster pace of the remix showcases Carey\u2019s own talents, in regards to rapping/rhyming and fast, lyrical singing; she sings the song\u2019s second verse very nimbly \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night, when you are on my mind; Bobby Womack\u2019s on the radio, singin\u2019 to me, \u2018If you think you\u2019re lonely now, wait until tonight\u2026\u2019 Boy, I\u2019m feelin\u2019 all out-of-my-element; I\u2019m throwin\u2019 things, cryin\u2019, tryin\u2019 to figure out where the hell I went wrong. The pain reflected in this song ain\u2019t even half of what I\u2019m feeling inside; I need ya-need ya back in my life, Baby.\u201d In contrast to the original slower version of the song (which ends in Mariah sustaining one long note, on the word \u201c\u2026(we belong) together\u2026\u201d sung at a C5), the remix features the same sustained ending note sung an octave higher, at a D6, showcasing her whistle register. The song then fades out, with Mariah singing, \u201c\u2026this is so hard to believe\u2026\u201d, which starts in her fourth octave, before jumping octaves to another D6 on the word \u201cbelieve\u201d.\n\n\nAside from the album version's main remix, several others were commissioned and released, although none contained new vocals from Carey.[71] Peter Rauhofer created the \"Reconstruction Mix/Atlantic Soul Vocal Mix\" and \"Atlantic Soul Vocal Mix\", which both feature a synthetic bass line, a piano and guitar line, and distinctive hi-hats that produce a more up-tempo, hard-hitting beat.[71]\n\n\nOn February 17, 2021, Carey released a new version of the song, the \"Mimi's Late Night Valentine's Mix\", in EP format, along with a seven-minute extended version of the song. Then, four days prior to the release, she performed on *Live with Kelly and Ryan*.[72]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nThe song's music video premiered worldwide on April 11, 2005, although MSN offered an exclusive look at the music video on April 9. Carey's \"We Belong Together\" is Yahoo! Music's most watched video of 2005 with 7.5 million streamed performances. The video was shot by film director Brett Ratner in Los Angeles alongside the video for Carey's previous single, \"It's Like That\".[4] Carey had collaborated with Ratner several times in the past, having worked on the video for \"Heartbreaker\", which became one of the most expensive of all time, costing an estimated $2.5\u00a0million.[4] The video was filmed through February 9 to 10, 2005, in conjunction with \"It's Like That\" and serves as the second half to the two-part story. The music video for \"It's Like That\" features Carey at her bachelorette party set to wed an older and powerful man, played by Eric Roberts.[73] Towards the end of the video, her ex-lover, played by Wentworth Miller, arrives at the event, and the video concludes with them staring into each other's eyes as Carey's soon-to-be husband watches from a balcony. The video for \"We Belong Together\" finishes their tale of love, and features Carey on her wedding day.[74] For the scenes of Carey's wedding to the older man, she wore her Vera Wang gown she originally wore during her nuptials to Tommy Mottola in 1993.[75] In an interview with MSNBC, when asked if there was a connection to the use of the dress in the video and reality, Carey responded:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> The wedding dress was a Vera Wang original dress from a while ago that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when we came up with the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, \u2018well, I do have my old wedding dress,\u2019. 'It\u2019s still worth [sic] for me \u2019cause I can\u2019t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get a fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage \u2013 it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.'[75]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the music video, Carey wore her wedding dress from her nuptials to Tommy Mottola in 1993. She is seen running from the altar, alongside her lover (Wentworth Miller), in the video's climactic scene.\nThe video features Carey readying for her wedding, and follows her to the altar, as well as her escape from the reception. Many of the actors featured in Carey's \"It's Like That\" video were in that of \"We Belong Together\", which was shot as a continuation from the \"It's Like That\" video. It begins with a scene of a large mansion, apparently owned by the older man who she is to marry. Carey is seen walking barefoot in a room, shedding a black sheer robe and laying down on a bed draped with white linens. Dressed in lingerie, Carey's face is shown close-up, as scenes of her tossing in the bed are shown. As the song begins, Carey is seen sitting in front of a large mirror, preparing for her wedding by putting on earrings and shoes, and staring at the ring on her finger. Additional scenes of Carey sitting on a small blue sofa, wearing a purple dress, and Carey staring at the camera during a shower moment are interspersed. The wedding is then shown, with Miller approaching the reception through a stairwell in the back. Small children as seen throwing flowers on the white carpet, followed by Roberts and Carey walking down the aisle.\n\n\nAs Carey, now dry and clothed, is shown in another scenario following the dressing scene, a still of Carey and Miller in the video for \"It's like That\" is shown, during the lyrics \"I can't sleep at night / When you are on my mind\". After several other scenes of Carey dressed in the purple gown and white shirt are interspersed, the altar is displayed, where before being ordained by the minister, Carey looks into her ex-lover's eyes once more. She turns to Roberts, and begins running towards Miller, leaving the reception. As the song's climax is reached, Carey and Miller are shown running from the reception, as the guests stand up in awe, and watch the pair leave. Carey, dressed in the white shirt, is shown with growing anticipation, crying to the camera and moving her hands and hair. Back at the wedding scene, Carey and her lover get into his vehicle, and drive away as her 27-foot train hangs behind the car. The video was nominated for \"Best R&B Video\" and \"Best Female Video\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.[76] On January 1, 2022, the music video reached 500 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\nDue to its continued chart success, Carey performed \"We Belong Together\" on several live televised performances and included it on the set-lists of all of her tours after its release. In the United Kingdom, Carey filmed a two-part appearance on the British music program *Top of the Pops*, performing \"It's Like That\", \"We Belong Together\", and \"Shake It Off\".[77] Additional European and Asian appearances included an interview on the French talk show *Le Grand Journal*, and a performance of \"We Belong Together\" on both *Music Station* and *Riponggi Hills* in Japan.[77] After returning to the United States for a string of televised performances, Carey launched the release of the album on *Good Morning America*, in the form of a five-piece outdoor concert.[78] The concert, taking place in Times Square and featuring the largest crowd in the plaza since the 2004 New Year's Eve celebration, featured the first three singles from the album, as well as \"Fly Like a Bird\" and \"Make It Happen\" (1991).[79][80] The following week, she performed \"We Belong Together\" at the 2005 BET Awards, with an additional appearance at the annual VH1 Save the Music special, filmed live on April 17 from the Beacon Theatre.[81][82][83][84] Throughout May, Carey appeared on several US television programs, performing \"We Belong Together\" on the *Late Show with David Letterman* (May 5), *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* (May 11), and *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* (May 13), which included a performance of \"It's Like That\".[16][85][86][87] As June approached, Carey made an appearance on *The Oprah Winfrey Show* (May 24), featuring a live rendition of \"We Belong Together\". She appeared on stage wearing a long blue evening gown, and featured a four piece band, as well as three background vocalists.[16][86] Eleven days later on June 4, she performed at the annual Macy's Fourth of July Parade, singing \"America the Beautiful\" and \"We Belong Together\".[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Carey performing \"We Belong Together\" on her Angels Advocate Tour\nThe following week, Carey made a live appearance at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.[90][91] The recital aired on television in black and white format, with Carey wearing a red Armani Priv\u00e9 and sporting a retro curled hairstyle, appearing in color. She performed \"We Belong Together\" on a white runway-styled stage with four male and female dancers.[92][93] Following the stateside promotion of the album, Carey traveled to the United Kingdom on July 2, 2005, for a benefit concert held in Hyde Park, London titled Live 8.[94] The televised event was watched by over 9.6\u00a0million British citizens and held a live audience of over 200,000.[94][95] Carey performed a three song set-list, opening with \"Make It Happen\" and \"Hero\", which featured a live choir of African children, and followed by \"We Belong Together\".[94][95] On August 3, *USA Today* announced that Carey would be added to the roster of performers at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, held on the 28th of the month.[96] The ceremony was held at the American Airlines Arena in downtown Miami Beach Florida, with Carey's performance taking place at the National Hotel in South Beach.[97] Apart from the Killers, she was the only performer to tape their appearance from an undisclosed location in Miami. After being introduced by Eva Longoria, Carey appeared on a long stage in the hotel's courtyard, with Dupri opening the song in a nearby cabana.[98] After performing \"Shake It Off\" and the official remix version of \"We Belong Together\", Carey made her way into the shallow pool, followed by Dupri and the back-up dancers.[98] Following the awards ceremony, Carey once again took to Europe, being featured as a head-lining performer at the 2005 Fashion Rocks, held in Monaco.[99] Following her introduction by Donatella Versace, Carey performed the Peter Rauhofer Remix for \"We Belong Together\" on a suspended rafter, while wearing a metallic Versace gown.[100] Carey played a similarly-choreographed performance of the song's Peter Rauhofer Remix at the German Bambi Awards, held in October 2005.[101] Two months later, she celebrated the new year on television, placing as the featured performer at the Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve in New York.[102] The special, titled Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, aired on ABC at 10\u00a0pm on December 31, and featured Carey on stage wearing a short sparkling dress, and performing a selection of the album's singles.[103][104][105]\n\n\nAt the 48th Grammy Awards, held on February 8, 2006, Carey was nominated for eight awards\u2014the most she had ever received in one night.[106] That night, Carey returned to the Grammy stage for the first time since 1996.[107] Her performance opened with a pre-taped video in which she discussed the importance of God and religion in her life.[108] Carey then came to the stage, dressed in a white Chanel gown, and sang a shortened version of \"We Belong Together\". Next, Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton read a Bible passage to open Carey's performance of \"Fly Like a Bird\", as he did in the studio recording of the song.[109] Midway through the song, a black temporary wall was removed, revealing a large choir who joined Carey for the song's gospel climax.[110] The performance earned the night's only standing ovation, prompting Teri Hatcher, who was presenting the next award, to exclaim, \"It's like we've all just been saved!\"[111] Carey's performance earned rave reviews from critics.[112][113][114] Gary Susman from *Entertainment Weekly* called Carey the \"comeback queen\", noting that her voice \"soar[ed] into the rafters like only Carey's can.\"[108] Carey included \"We Belong Together\" on both succeeding tours following its release, the Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours. On the former, the song was featured as the encore number, with Carey re-entering the arenas in a form fitting beige evening gown.[115][116] Backed by three background vocalists, Trey Lorenz, Sherry Tatum, and MaryAnn Tatum, Carey began the song as confetti dropped the arena rafters.[115] According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News, the performance was \"a major accomplishment\", and the highlight of the show, and found Carey re-connect with the audience in ways that she was unable throughout most of the show.[116] Similarly, during her Angel's Advocate Tour, the song was placed as one of the final numbers on the set-list. Dressed in a black Herve Leger gown, Carey introduced the song as the *Billboard*'s \"song of the decade\", and thanked the audience for making it her 16th number-one single in the United States.[117] Following the song's completion, Carey exited the arena for a few moments, before returning to perform \"Hero\" as the encore.[117]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2021, Carey performed the song live on *Live with Kelly and Ryan* ahead of Valentine's Day with a new live mix entitled the \"Mimi's Late Night Valentine\u2019s Mix\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Formats and track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **Digital download**\n1. \"We Belong Together\" \u2013 3:22[119]\n* **Digital download \u2013 remix**\n1. \"We Belong Together\" (Remix feat.

Angel. Music. Baby.* (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as the Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year at the 48th Grammy Awards; however, it lost in both categories. The song divided pop music critics, with some praising its minimalistic production and others declaring it embarrassing. The men's magazine *Maxim* named it as the \"Most Annoying Song Ever\". In the United States, the song topped the *Billboard* Hot 100 for four weeks \u2013 it was ranked at number two on the Year-End Hot 100. The single topped the charts in Australia and reached the top-ten in several other countries, including Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified five-times Platinum in United States by the RIAA, and in Australia by the ARIA.\n\n\nA music video with Stefani as a cheerleader at a California high school was released on March 21, 2005, and was directed by Paul Hunter. The video received four nominations at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, and ultimately won for Best Choreography. Stefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on numerous occasions, including on all three of her concert tours, and on several televised appearances.\n\n\n\n\n## Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stefani performing \"Hollaback Girl\" in 2007 at The Sweet Escape Tour.\nAs part of Gwen Stefani's vision of creating \"a silly dance record\",[1] she had worked with the Neptunes (Pharrell and Chad Hugo) during the early stages of writing songs. However, a case of writer's block resulted in reportedly uninspired collaborations.[2] As the album neared completion, Stefani regained her confidence and booked another session with the Neptunes. Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Pharrell, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Pharrell called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired. I wanted to go home, but he was like, 'Don't leave yet.'\"[3] When she returned to the studio, Pharrell began to play Stefani his first solo album, and she became envious.[2] Excited by his material, she decided to write another song with Pharrell, despite her opinion that the album already contained far too many tracks.[3]\n\n\nTo search for inspiration, Stefani and Pharrell had a lengthy discussion in which Stefani said that she had yet to write a song about her intentions for pursuing a solo career. She remarked how the album was missing an \"attitude song\", and she recalled a derogatory comment that grunge musician Courtney Love had made about her in an interview with *Seventeen* magazine: \"Being famous is just like being in high school. But I'm not interested in being the cheerleader. I'm not interested in being Gwen Stefani. She's the cheerleader, and I'm out in the smoker shed.\"[4][5] Stefani responded to Love's comments in the March 2005 issue of *NME*: \"Y'know someone one time called me a cheerleader, negatively, and I've never been a cheerleader. So I was, like, 'OK, fuck you. You want me to be a cheerleader? Well, I will be one then. And I'll rule the whole world, just you watch me.'\"[6] The song uses the lyric and a melodic interpolation, of \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen, referencing the common usage of the song at sporting events, aimed at losing opponents, with Stefani's antagonistic stance likely aimed at Love.[7]\n\n\nStefani believed that some No Doubt fans would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, \"[They] were probably like, 'Why is she doing this record? She's going to ruin everything'.\" She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album.[2] For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Pharrell incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right.[2] On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Pharrell was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"[3]\n\n\nBecause Stefani never disclosed the song title's meaning, reviewers came up with various interpretations. In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, *OC Weekly* critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that \"Gwen is apparently the captain of the cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back\".[8] The most commonly accepted meaning is that a \"hollaback girl\" responds positively to the \"catcalls\" or hollers of men, but it might mean to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and \"step it up\".[9] In March 2021, it was revealed that a comment made by British supermodel Naomi Campbell served as inspiration for the chorus.[10] In an appearance on Campbell's YouTube talk show *No Filter*, Pharrell stated that she had responded to someone trying to speak, \"I'm sorry, I have a name. I ain't no Holla Back girl\", the latter phrase apparently referencing the Fabolous song \"Young'n (Holla Back)\"; Pharrell was inspired by the overheard conversation and incorporated the lyric into the chorus of \"Hollaback Girl\".[11]\n\n\n\n## Composition and musical style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\"\n\n\nStefani sings in a chant during the chorus for \"Hollaback Girl\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music.[12][13] It is a moderately fast song (with a tempo of 110 beats per minute) and it is played in the key of D\u266f minor.[14] Like the majority of pop music, it is set in common time. The main chord pattern of the song alternates between B major and D\u266f minor triads.[14] Most of the harmonic content of the song revolves around a two-chord alternation which music theorists may regard as an L (leading tone) transformation, in which the root of the major chord is lowered by a half-step to form a second inversion minor chord on the third scale degree, a slight tonicization of B major, but resolving back to D\u266f minor by having the same A\u266f, a perfect fourth down from D\u266f. This stepwise motion between B and A\u266f highlights this chord change. The song is in verse-chorus form with a bridge before the fourth and last chorus. The song features sparse instrumentation, primarily a minimal beat produced by drum machine.[15][16][17] A guitar plays the song's riff, a six-note pattern as Stefani repeats \"this my shit\" during the chorus, and a brass section joins during the second chorus.[9] In part because of its cheerleading motif, it drew comparisons to Toni Basil's 1982 song \"Mickey\".[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stefani performing \"Hollaback Girl\" on the Harajuku Lovers Tour\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Yahoo! Music's Jennifer Nine described it as a \"stomping, stripped-back\" track,[20] and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that it had the \"thumping, minimal beats\" of the Neptunes.[16] Richard Smirke of Playlouder called it \"a trademark Neptunes hip-hop stomp.\"[21] In his review of *Love. Angel. Music. Baby.*, Rob Sheffield of *Rolling Stone* gave the song a positive review, writing that \"Stefani's gum-snapping sass brings out the beast in her beatmasters, especially the Neptunes in 'Hollaback Girl'.\"[22] *Blender* listed it as the 11th best song of 2005,[23] and the song tied with Damian Marley's \"Welcome to Jamrock\" for number five on the 2005 Pazz & Jop, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau.[24]\n\n\nOn the other hand, Jason Damas, in a review for *PopMatters*, felt that the song sounds \"almost exactly like Dizzee Rascal\", and added, \"Lyrically, this is where Gwen sinks the lowest here, especially on a breakdown where she repeats, 'This shit is bananas / B-A-N-A-N-A-S!' several times\".[25] Eric Greenwood of Drawer B called the song \"moronic and embarrassingly tuneless,\" while also writing \"I'd quote the lyrics, but they're so bad, I almost feel sorry for her. A 35-year-old woman singing about pom-poms and 'talking shit' in high school betrays such a delusional self-image that it's hard not to be taken aback. And on top of that, the Neptunes' beats are clunky and the production is senselessly bombastic.\"[26] Nick Sylvester of *Pitchfork* also criticized the track, referring to it as a \"Queen pastiche [...] which has about as much club potential as a 13-year old with a milk moustache and his dad's ID\".[27] However, despite this initial negative review, Pitchfork would later place the track at number 35 on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2005,[28] and at number 180 on its list of the Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.[29] *Maxim* was unimpressed with the song, and in its October 2005 issue, published a list of the \"20 Most Annoying Songs Ever\" with \"Hollaback Girl\" in first place.[30] Cat Conway of *Drowned in Sound* gave the song a negative review, saying \"Hollaback Girl\" sees Gwen Stefani getting a big lick off the Neptunes flavour at the Hot Producer Baskin-Robbins [*sic*], delivering vocals that sound like she needs a Sudafed.\"[31]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" entered the *Billboard* Hot 100 at number 82 on the issue dated April 2, 2005,[32] and within six weeks of its release, it had reached the top of the chart,[33] becoming Stefani's first and only US number one.[34] It ended the nine-week run of 50 Cent's \"Candy Shop\" featuring Olivia, and maintained the number-one position for four consecutive weeks.[35] \"Hollaback Girl\" ranked second on the 2005 Hot 100 year-end chart.[36] The song held the record for most US radio airplays in one week, with 9,582 plays, and maintained this record for over a year before Shakira and Wyclef Jean's \"Hips Don't Lie\" overtook the position.[37] \"Hollaback Girl\" peaked at number one on the *Billboard* Pop 100 chart for eight weeks and at number 15 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.[38][39] The song was a crossover success and reached number four on the Rhythmic Top 40 and number eight on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[40][41]\n\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" was noted for having a large number of digital downloads, becoming the first single to sell more digital downloads than CDs.[42] In October 2005, \"Hollaback Girl\" was the first single to ever sell one million digital downloads and later went on to sell a total of 1.2 million downloads.[42][43] It was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It was later re-certified platinum, for the same sales, due to the change of the RIAA certification criteria for singles.[44][45][a] On the year-end list for Hot Digital Songs in 2005, \"Hollaback Girl\" topped the chart.[47]\n\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" was successful in Canada, where the song debuted and peaked at number 12 on the Canadian Singles Chart.[48] However, Graham Henderson, president of the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), later argued that based on Canada's population relative to the US, the single should have sold around 120,000 copies and that the comparatively lower sales of 25,000 were a sign that the Canadian copyright law should be tightened to discourage non-commercial peer-to-peer file sharing.[49] Columnist Michael Geist disputed the comparison, arguing that the Canadian online music market was still developing.[50] The song was released in Australia on May 23, 2005,[51] debuting at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart,[52] and in Europe on June 6, 2005, reaching number five on the European Hot 100 Singles.[53] In the United Kingdom, \"Hollaback Girl\" was released on the same day,[54] but it did not perform as well as Stefani's previous releases. The song's predecessors, \"What You Waiting For?\" and \"Rich Girl\", had both reached number four, while \"Hollaback Girl\" debuted at number eight and remained at the same position the following week.[55] Although its UK success was limited, it remained in the top 40 for an additional 11 weeks.[55] The single was largely successful across Europe, reaching the top five in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Ireland, and the top 10 in Belgium, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.[56]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stefani on a Chevrolet Impala with the album cover art\nThe music video for \"Hollaback Girl\" was directed by Paul Hunter and filmed in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California.[57] It opens with a scene of Stefani taking a picture of her four Harajuku Girls, when a crowd of students appears. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then drive down Sherman Way past Magnolia Science Academy to Birmingham High School in a 1961 Chevrolet Impala, accompanied by the crowd.[57][58] Stefani and the group cause a commotion when they disrupt a football game by walking onto the field and when they go to a 99 Cents Only Store and throw cereal and other food products down an aisle. Throughout the video, there are intercut sequences of choreographed dancing filmed in a sound stage, intended to represent Stefani's imagination.[59] Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are outfitted in cheerleading uniforms, accompanied by several Californian spirit groups: the Orange Crush All Stars, a cheerleading squad from Orange County; a marching band from Fountain Valley High School in Fountain Valley; a pep flag team named the Carson High School Flaggies from Carson; and a drill team from Stephen M. White Middle School in Carson.[57] To visualize the song's bridge, the Harajuku Girls spell the word \"bananas\" with cue cards. The video ends with a close-up frame of Stefani with her arms in the air.\n\n\nThe Chevy Impala convertible from the video includes a painting by artist J. Martin.[5] The design includes Stefani as seen on the album cover of *Love. Angel. Music. Baby.* with the words \"Hollaback Girl\" in calligraphy. The car was, eventually, sold on eBay.[5] Pharrell, one of the song's co-producers, makes a cameo appearance. The complete version of \"Hollaback Girl\" featured in the music video was released commercially through CD singles and digital downloads. Some include remixes by Diplo and former No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal.\n\n\nThe video debuted on March 21, 2005, and proved successful on video chart programs.[60] It debuted on MTV's *TRL* on March 31 at number 10 and remained on the program for a total of 50 days,[61] becoming what *Rolling Stone* called \"a staple of MTV's *TRL*\".[62] The video reached the top of the chart and was retired at number four on June 23, becoming Stefani's first video to retire.[63][64] VH1 listed the video at number five on its Top 40 Videos of 2005,[65] and at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video received four nominations,[66] but only won the award for Best Choreography.[67] Stefani did not attend the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, prompting rumors that she was protesting her lack of nominations the previous year, her multiple losses to Kelly Clarkson, and her not having been asked to perform.[68] Stefani denied the rumors, responding, \"the only reason I am not attending the MTV Video Music Awards is because I will be recording and spending time with my family.\"[68]\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\nStefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on several occasions, including on two of her concert tours, in addition to several appearances on TV shows. During the majority of the 2005 Harajuku Lovers Tour, Stefani sang the single as an encore performance, where she wore a drumming costume and encouraged the audience to sing along with her.[69] However, in earlier shows, before the single's success, she sang it before tracks \"Serious\" and \"Bubble Pop Electric\".[70][71] During The Sweet Escape Tour, she performed the song in the middle of the show wearing sparkly red shorts and an argyle jacket atop a L.A.M.B. black and white shirt. She also sported a belt buckle featuring the \"G\" motif frequently used in *The Sweet Escape*.[72]\n\n\nWhen Stefani agreed to be a judge on season 7 of the NBC music competition *The Voice*, she sang the track in May 2014 alongside Pharrell, who would also be appearing on the show as a judge.[73] For the rendition, Stefani wore a black jumpsuit in contrast to Pharrell, who wore a Mickey Mouse-sweater and jeans.[74][75] The performance prompted the song to enter the *Billboard* Pop Digital Songs component chart, where it re-entered at number thirty-four.[76] On the May 4, 2016, episode of *The Late Late Show with James Corden*, Stefani sang a snippet of the song alongside James Corden in his show's segment \"Carpool Karaoke\".[77] In addition to Stefani and Corden, actor George Clooney and actress Julia Roberts sang along; when the song concluded, Clooney stated \"this [bleep]'s bananas\".[78] More recently, the single was included on her 2016 concert series This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour.[79] On November 27, 2019, Stefani performed \"Hollaback Girl\", alongside \"What You Waitin\u2019 For\" and \"Rich Girl\", in a medley on *The Voice* in season 17 to commemorate *Love. Angel. Music. Baby.*'s 15th anniversary.[80]\n\n\n\n## Track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **European two-track CD single**[81]\n1. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Album Version)\u00a0\u2013 3:19\n2. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Hollatronix Remix by Diplo)\u00a0\u2013 2:44\n* **Australian and European CD maxi single**[82]\n1. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Album Version)\u00a0\u2013 3:19\n2. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Hollatronix Remix by Diplo)\u00a0\u2013 2:44\n3. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Instrumental)\u00a0\u2013 3:19\n4. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Video)\u00a0\u2013 3:28\n | * **US 12-inch single**[83]\n\nA1. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Dancehollaback Remix featuring Elan)\u00a0\u2013 6:53\nA2. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Dancehollaback Remix Clean featuring Elan)\u00a0\u2013 6:52\nA3. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Dancehollaback Remix Radio featuring Elan)\u00a0\u2013 4:02\nB1. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Hollatronic Remix)\u00a0\u2013 2:44\nB2. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Dancehollaback Remix Instrumental)\u00a0\u2013 6:50\nB3. \"Hollaback Girl\" (Dancehollaback Remix A Capppella)\u00a0\u2013 6:19\n\n |\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\nPersonnel are adapted from the liner notes of *Love.

versions[edit]\n\n\nDiplo made a remix for the track after M.I.A. turned down an offer to produce one.[138] Tony Kanal, fellow No Doubt member, also produced a remix titled the Dancehollaback Remix. The track features reggae singer Elan Atias, whose debut album Kanal produced.[139] It appears as a single on iTunes, on the CD single for \"Cool\",[140] and on the bonus CD of the deluxe edition of *Love. Angel. Music. Baby.*[141] Stefani later requested to contribute vocals on \"I Wanna Yell\" from Atias's debut album *Together as One*,[142] and was featured on his song \"Allnighter\".[143]\n\n\nRumoredly, Weird Al had plans to do with his new album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006, called \"Holodeck Girl\", but it never came to fruition. Later that year, Gabe Saporta of Cobra Starship recorded a parody of the song titled \"*Hollaback Boy*\".[144] Stefani also performed a \"countrified version\" of *Hollaback Girl* part of a skit on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* where Fallon portrayed the character Buck Pinto promoting a fictitious album *Gwen's Gone Country*.[145]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 2005\n* List of Billboard Mainstream Top 40 number-one songs of 2005\n* List of number-one singles of 2005 (Australia)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The number of sales required to qualify for gold and platinum discs was lower for digital singles prior to August 2006. The thresholds were 100,000 units (gold) and 200,000 units (platinum), reflecting an increase in digital downloads.[46]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Salmon, Chris (March 2, 2007). \"I just want to make music and babies\". *The Guardian*.

The song was written by Ne-Yo, Kameron Houff, and Scott Storch, while the production was handled by Storch. The song garnered Mario a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2006 and became a top-10 hit worldwide, reaching number one in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.\n\n\nIn 2008, \"Let Me Love You\" was ranked at number 45 on *Billboard*'s All-Time Top 100 Hot 100 singles during the first 50 years of the chart.[2] It was the eighth most successful single of the decade according to the *Billboard* Hot 100 Songs of the Decade chart released in December 2009.[3] In 2013, it was ranked at number 53 on *Billboard*'s All-Time Top 100 Hot 100 singles during the first 55 years of the chart.[4] The remix of the song, also produced by Storch, contains rapped verses from Jadakiss and T.I.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and composition[edit]\n\n\nThe song was written by Kameron Houff, Ne-Yo, and Scott Storch, who also produced the track.[5] According to Ne-Yo, after he chose to start singing his songs, he regretted giving \"Let Me Love You\" to Mario and said that he would have kept it for himself.[6] \"Let Me Love You\" is a moderate R&B ballad in G minor, centered around the progression C minor / G minor / F major. It is written in common time.[7]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nJon Pareles from *The New York Times* commented that \"Let Me Love You\" \"looks back to another 1980s blockbuster, lifting its keyboard sound from Tina Turner's 'What's Love Got to Do with It'.\"[8]\n\n\n\n### Accolades and nominations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, \"Let Me Love You\" was nominated for a Vibe Award for Best R&B Song and two Teen Choice Awards, Choice Love Song and Choice R&B/Rap Track, but it failed to receive any awards. In 2005, it received nominations for *Billboard* Music Awards, including \"Hot 100 Single of the Year\", \"Hot 100 Airplay Single of the Year\", \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Single of the Year\", \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay Single of the Year, winning in both the R&B categories. It was also nominated for an MTV Europe Music Award for Best R&B Single, a Viewer's Choice award at the BET Awards, Best Single at the MOBO Awards, and Best R&B/Soul Song at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 2006, Mario was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance with \"Let Me Love You\". He also received an MTV Australia Awards nomination for Best R&B music video for \"Let Me Love You\".[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Let Me Love You\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 the week of October 23, 2004, at number 97. The song went on to hold the number-one position on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks from January to February 2005, and, as of 2024, is Mario's biggest single. It also reached number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, it reached the number-one position on the singles charts in Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number two on the UK Singles Chart (held off the top spot by \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\"), making it Mario's biggest hit to date in the UK. The single also holds the honor of being one of the highest-selling ringtones with 1.6\u00a0million downloads.[17]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video was filmed at studios in Brooklyn, New York in September 2004, directed by Little X.

The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, was released as the lead single from *Breakaway* two weeks before the album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sounds with a mixture of a soft and loud pop rock sound. Martin originally wrote \"Since U Been Gone\" with Pink in mind, but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff, but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship.\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" received positive reviews from music critics who considered the song to be the highlight of *Breakaway*. Critics also felt that it was one of the best pop songs in the last decade. *Rolling Stone* ranked it at number 482 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010 and at number 93 in the revamped 2021 ranking, while Billboard ranked it as the 5th greatest pop song of all time. \"Since U Been Gone\" was a commercial success. In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the *Billboard* Hot 100. It topped the US Pop 100 for six consecutive weeks and the US Pop Songs for seven consecutive weeks respectively. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over one million copies sold. \"Since U Been Gone\" was also a worldwide success, peaking in the top five in Austria, Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. It also peaked in the top ten in Norway, Germany, and Switzerland.\n\n\nClarkson performed \"Since U Been Gone\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and at the 2006 BRIT Awards. It has been included on the set-list of Clarkson's many tours. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Alex De Rakoff, which shows Clarkson ruining her ex-boyfriend's apartment. The music video was nominated for three awards in the 2005 MTV Music Awards, winning two out of the three awards namely Best Female Video and Best Pop Video. At the 48th Grammy Awards, the song won the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. \"Since U Been Gone\" was covered by many artists, notably the American rock band A Day to Remember, indie rocker Ted Leo as well as the Canadian indie rock band, Tokyo Police Club, and used in the musical *& Juliet*.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and writing[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I went to Max Martin's studio in Sweden. We recorded it there with Max and the co-writer of the song, Lukasz Gottwald. The first time I heard the song I thought it was a little poppy, so I asked if we could rock the track a little. We put some heavier guitars and harder drums on it. Now it's explosive.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Clarkson's first impression of \"Since U Been Gone\".[1]\n\nIn an interview for *Blender*, Martin and Dr. Luke revealed that they had originally intended Pink to sing \"Since U Been Gone\", however, she turned it down.[2] Dr. Luke also explained that Hilary Duff's management was interested in the song but rejected it because Duff could not reach the song's higher notes.[2][3][4] It was Clive Davis who convinced Martin and Dr. Luke to give the song to Clarkson, even though they were initially reluctant. Davis said, \"Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an 'American Idol' winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song.\"[5]\nAccording to MTV, Clarkson had already finished recording her materials for her second album, *Breakaway* in late 2004 when she was advised by her A&R to fly to Sweden to meet with Martin and Dr. Luke.[6] Both Martin and Dr. Luke were associated with pop music, but they wanted to produce rock songs. Realizing that her record had more of a rock influence, Clarkson finally agreed to collaborate with them.\"[6]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" was inspired by the 2003 song \"Maps\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.[7] In an interview with *Billboard*, Dr. Luke said:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> That was a conscious move by Max and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music ... I said, \"Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?\" It worked.[5]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\"Maps\" and \"Since U Been Gone\" share similar introductions, post-chorus guitar breaks, middle eights, and are both in the key of G major.[8] Yeah Yeah Yeahs songwriter Karen O said noticing the similarity was \"like getting bitten by a poisonous varmint\".[9]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" was the last track that Clarkson recorded for *Breakaway*;[6] it was recorded in Sweden.[10] At first, Clarkson was not fully convinced by the prospect of recording the song saying, \"It didn't have any lyrics and the melody really wasn't finalized ... the track was done on a computer, there was no band on it. My record label was freaking out about it and I was, like, why?\"[11] Clarkson also explained that when she first heard \"Since U Been Gone\", she felt that it sounded a little bit pop for her direction, and she decided to tweak the song musically by incorporating drums and guitars.[1] Clarkson told MTV that the song is about a relationship turned sour although it was going well at the very beginning.[6] The song was officially released to mainstream radio stations in the United States on November 16, 2004, as the lead single of *Breakaway*.[12]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" (2004)\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" received positive review from critics for its infectious hook and refreshing musical arrangements.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" is a bubblegum[13] and indie rock-influenced[14] pop rock[15] and power pop[16] power ballad[17] written and produced by Max Martin and Dr. Luke.[18] The song, which is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 132 beats per minute, is written in the key of G major.[19] Popdose staff noted that the song contains an \"electronics-enhanced sheen\" over \"alt-rock's soft/loud dichotomy\".[20] The song also incorporates ringing guitars with plaintive lyrics[21] and a huge chorus.[22] It has a chord progression of G-Am\u2013Em\u2013F, and Clarkson's vocal range in the song spans two octaves from the low note of G3 to the high note of G5.[19] Film Laureate of Blogcritics praised \"Since U Been Gone\" for its \"high energy, vocally powered, pop/rock jam with a hook that is infectious\".[23] The same opinion was echoed by *Entertainment Weekly* staff who thought that the song highlighted Clarkson's \"sublime\" vocals and praised the song for its \"addictive\" hook.[24] Dave Donnelly of Sputnikmusic compared the musical arrangements of \"Since U Been Gone\" to Clarkson's \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\". He opined that the two songs allow the melodies to represent themselves because the tight musical arrangements complement Clarkson's vocals.[25]\n\n\nThe song's narrative is in first person, from the point of view of a woman who is relieved with the end of her relationship.[26] Steve Lampiris of ZME Music lauded Clarkson's vocals as the heart of the song. He praised the way Clarkson sings the chorus, which implies that she was the one who ended the relationship. He also thought that the line \"I can breathe for the first time/ I'm so moving on, yeah yeah\" was believable \"that either her ex is a total prick or she's deserves [*sic*] an Oscar nom.\"[27] In an interview with Dan Snierson of *Entertainment Weekly*, it was noted that Clarkson sang \"So together but so broken up inside/ 'Cause I can't breathe\" in \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", but in \"Since U Been Gone\", she sang \"But since you been gone/ I can breathe for the first time.\" When asked whether she was a bipolar asthmatic, Clarkson responded that \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" is about a dipstick who is unhappy because she has completely screwed up, and \"Since U Been Gone\" is an expression of relief because her ex is now miserable.[28]\n\n\n\n## Response[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe song received positive reviews upon its release. In his review for *Breakaway*, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of MSN considered \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Walk Away\", and \"You Found Me\" as the spine of the album. He added that the songs sound mainstream and youthful.[29] Rohin of Blogcritics gave a positive response to the song, emphasizing that \"it is almost one of the best pieces of throwaway pop in recent history\". He also thought that the song represents a song \"that you can roll down the windows of your car and proudly headbang your way through a yellow light somewhere on a suburban side street.\"[30] Sal Cinquemani of *Slant Magazine* thought that Clarkson did a good impression of Pat Benatar in \"Since U Been Gone\".[31] He concluded his review by emphasizing that *Breakaway* proves that Clarkson has successfully dodged the sophomore slump but \"Since U Been Gone\" helped her establish her success.[32] The staff of *Slant Magazine* later ranked \"Since U Been Gone\" at number thirteen in their list of Best Singles of the Aughts, writing that the song proves Clarkson's powerful ability as a vocalist as well as her versatility as an artist.[33]\n\n\nStephen Thompson of NPR Music called the song \"one of the decade's finest pop anthems\" which is infused with energy, charisma and full-throated intensity.[34] Steve Lampiris of ZME Music opined that the song is \"one of very few perfect pop songs released in the last ten years,\" stating that it is hard to determine the principal reason that makes the song very successful.[27] Gary Trust of *Billboard* thought that \"Since U Been Gone\" is a defining song of the 2000s. He commented on its status as a blueprint for female pop songs, as seen in song productions by artists such as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Pink.[35] In 2014, Ryan Kailath of NPR Music argued that the song succeeded by borrowing from musical trends that preceded it, such as 1990s R&B and alternative rock.[36] In 2015, Gary Trust of *Billboard* wrote that \"Kelly Clarkson's \"Since U Been Gone\", co-written by Max Martin, especially helped lead to pure pop's reemergence, and the breakthroughs of Rihanna, Katy Perry, [Taylor] Swift and Lady Gaga would soon follow (as well as [Britney] Spears' own revival)\", stating that the song \"began to erode hip-hop's early '00s reign, with women at the forefront of turning the tide.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nAt the 48th Grammy Awards, \"Since U Been Gone\" won the category of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[38][39] At the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, the song won the category of Choice Single.[40] It also won the award for Best Pop Sing-Along Song at the 2005 XM Nation Music Awards.[41] The song received a nomination in the category of Song of the Year: Mainstream Hit Radio at the 2005 Radio Music Awards[42] but lost to Mariah Carey's \"We Belong Together\".[43] At the 2005 Billboard Music Awards, the song received nominations for two awards. It received a nomination for the Hot 100 Single of the Year but lost to Mariah Carey's \"We Belong Together\" and for the Digital Song of the Year but lost to Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\". In 2023, *Billboard* named \"Since U Been Gone\" the fifth-best pop song of all time, the highest-ranked song on the list from the 21st century.[44]\n\n\n\n## Chart performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" entered the *Billboard* Hot 100 at number 70 for the week ending December 18, 2004.[45] On its second week, the song moved to number 53,[46] before jumping to number 38 the following week.[47] During the week ending April 9, 2005, \"Since U Been Gone\" ascended to a new peak of number two on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[48] This made \"Since U Been Gone\" the first pop song by a solo female artist to reach the top two chart positions in 2005.[49] The song also became the first non-R&B/hip hop song by a solo female artist to reach top two on the chart since Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\" hit number two in February 2003.[49] Fred Bronson of *Billboard* noted that had \"Since U Been Gone\" moved to number one, it would become the 41st chart-topper for the *American Idol* franchise.[49] The song stayed in the top 10 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 for 20 weeks.[50] After the week ending March 26, 2005, the song topped the US Pop 100 for six consecutive weeks, through the week ending March 26, 2005.[51] It also spent seven consecutive weeks at number one on the US Pop Songs.[52] On the *Billboard*'s Radio Songs chart, the song peaked at number four on April 23, 2005.[53] \"Since U Been Gone\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 25, 2006.[54] As of September 2017, \"Since U Been Gone\" has sold 2,973,000 paid digital downloads.[55]\n\n\nInternationally, \"Since U Been Gone\" was a commercial success. In Australia, the song debuted and peaked at number three on February 13, 2005.[56] It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of over 70,000 units.[57] In New Zealand, Since U Been Gone debuted at number 18 on the week ending March 21, 2005. Three weeks later, it peaked at number 11 and matched that position for three non-consecutive weeks.[58] On July 16, 2005, \"Since U Been Gone\" debuted and peaked at number five in the United Kingdom,[59] and as of April 2023, the song sold over 1,200,000 copies there.[60] In Ireland, it entered the Irish Singles Chart at number eight on the week ending July 7, 2005[61] and peaked at number four three weeks later.[62] Elsewhere in Europe, the song was also a success; it peaked at number three in Austria,[63] number seven in Switzerland,[64] number nine in Norway,[65] number 10 in the Netherlands,[66] and number 16 in Sweden.[67]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nThe music video for \"Since U Been Gone\" was directed by Alex De Rakoff and filmed in early November 2004.[68] Clarkson told MTV that she conceived the idea of the video after assuming that revenge is what every girl wants to do when their boyfriend cheats on them. She added, \"You know, 'Why don't I just go trash her house? [...] And so I do it in the video. All I do is break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this.\"[6] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, \"In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like my apartment, but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video.\"[6] The music video premiered on *Total Request Live* on November 16, 2004.[6]\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\nThe music video begins with Clarkson sitting on a couch in an apartment's living room, holding a heart-shaped locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes her face in the mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture, and chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.[68]\n\n\n\n### Reception and accolades[edit]\n\n\nStephen Thompson of NPR Music was disappointed with the music video because it \"undercuts its message to an alarming degree: The words say 'Since you've been gone / I can breathe for the first time,' but the pictures say, 'Breaking up with you necessitates destroying all of your property.'\"[34] On the other hand, Johnni Macke of E! felt the video was amusing and Clarkson was \"at her rocker prime.\" She added, \"It features the tomboy side of the singer messing up her ex's closet, destroying his bed and getting some major revenge by destroying his place.\"[69] At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the music video received nominations for three awards; it won Best Female Video and Best Pop Video,[70] and received a nomination for the Viewer's Choice Awards but lost to Green Day's \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".[71][72] MusicOMH ranked the music video as the 86th best video of the last decade.[73] In February 2012, the music video received a *Pop-Up Video* treatment by VH1 which shows \"pops up\" bubbles containing trivia, witticisms and borderline sexual innuendos throughout the video.[74]\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Clarkson performing \"Since U Been Gone\" during her My December Tour\nClarkson performed \"Since U Been Gone\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her performance garnered positive reviews from critics, who considered it one of the highlights in the event.[76] Performing barefoot,[77] Clarkson sang the song as rain cascaded onto the audience.[78][79] Clarkson told *People* that one of her favourite moments on television was performing \"Since U Been Gone\" at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying \"I hate being all dressed up, so the fact that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared all over my face was definitely the highlight of my evening!\"[80] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances[77] while Kelefa Sanneh of *The New York Times* thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that she sounded better dry than drenched.[81] Clarkson performed the song on *Saturday Night Live* in 2005,[82] along with the 2006 BRIT Awards which took place in Earls Court, London.[83]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" has been performed by Clarkson in all of her tours since the Breakaway Tour. It was included in the setlist of her My December Tour as an encore. While performing at Mohegan Sun Arena, Uncasville, Connecticut, Clarkson performed \"Since U Been Gone\" and let the audience sing the song's chorus.[84] Clarkson's performance of the song at the Beacon Theatre, New York City stirred crowd into a frenzy, causing the show to be closed abruptly.[85] During her All I Ever Wanted Tour, Clarkson performed the song at the Hammerstein Ballroom, where Caryn Ganz of *Rolling Stone* remarked that \"the room turned into an electric sea of flailing arms and pogo-ing heads.\"[86] In 2011, Clarkson performed \"Since U Been Gone\" as well as \"Mr. Know It All\" on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* while promoting her fifth album, *Stronger*.[87] At the *VH1 Divas Celebrates Soul* television special, Clarkson performed a medley of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\", \"Spotlight\", \"Real Love\", and \"Since U Been Gone\" with Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson.[88] The song was also performed by Clarkson during her 2012 Stronger Tour. While touring at the Times Union Center, Albany, New York, Clarkson performed the song with a musical arrangement. Grey Haymes of Times Union remarked that the song was \"re-made and re-modeled with a throbbing, fuzzed-out bassline and an irresistible techno pulse as the foundation for her hook-filled pop song.\" He also added that it was one of the several surprises from the concert.[89]\n\n\n\n## Cover versions and use in media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ted Leo covered \"Since U Been Gone\" after watching the song's music video.\n\"Since U Been Gone\" has been covered by many artists. On September 27, 2011, Joseph Gordon-Levitt covered the song in the style of Axl Rose on *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*.[90] The song was also covered by American musician Butch Walker in his 2005 album, *Cover Me Badd*. Dave Donelly of Sputnikmusic praised Walker's cover for sticking closely to Clarkson's version.[91] American rock band A Day to Remember recorded their own version of \"Since U Been Gone\" which was included in the reissued version of their album, *For Those Who Have Heart*.[92] Indie rock artist Ted Leo recorded an acoustic version of \"Since U Been Gone\" for a videotaped web session a few hours after watching the song's music video. He commented, \"It's just one great hook after another. I also really appreciate the more advanced pop pastiche aspects of it. It's written in a way that is so transparent in terms of drawing from a lot of what's vaguely edgy and popular right now, but put together in such a perfect little package. It's undeniable.\"[93] A cover of the song by Canadian indie rock band Tokyo Police Club was included in their \"Ten Days, Ten Covers, Ten Years\" project where they covered a song every day for ten days.[94] \"Since U Been Gone\" was sampled in Girl Talk's \"Here's The Thing\" on his 2008 album, *Feed the Animals*.[95] The song was included as the opening track of the *American Idol 10th Anniversary \u2013 The Hits*, a compilation album that celebrates 10 years of *American Idol* which features tracks from nine winners of the show.[96][97]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" has also been covered by contestants from reality television singing competitions. The song was performed by Todrick Hall on the eighth season of *American Idol*. Despite fulfilling the judges' desire to hear something original, his rendition of the song drew criticism from the judges, with Simon Cowell commenting that Hall seemed like a dancer trying to sing.[98] On November 26, 2011, Amelia Lily performed the song on the eighth series of *The X Factor UK*. Her rendition was praised by the judges; Louis Walsh felt that her performance was effortless while Kelly Rowland remarked that \"Amelia Lily hits those notes in her sleep!\"[*citation needed*] The song was also covered by Luke O'Dell on the third season of *The X Factor Australia*.[99] On June 13, 2012, John Legend and his duet partner, Meleana Brown, covered \"Since U Been Gone\" in *Duets*. Katy Kroll of *Rolling Stone* lambasted their cover for being \"pitchy\" and \"almost unlistenable\",[100] Gord Craig of *Leader-Post* felt that Brown did not deliver her best although she sounded great with Legend.[101] In the third season of *The Sing Off*, the winning group Pentatonix sang a \"mastermix\" of \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Forget You\". All three judges were impressed with Ben Folds commenting \"You guys gave voices to the instruments\" while Shawn Stockman, praising the rhythm and percussion section, renamed Kevin and Avi \"Meat and Potatoes\".[102]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" was performed by Ester Dean and Skylar Astin in the 2012 musical comedy film, *Pitch Perfect*.[103] Lanford Beard of *Entertainment Weekly* noted that the song was used during the audition sequences in the film, writing \"Set to Kelly Clarkson's \"Since U Been Gone,\" it arranged the singers in a clever a cappella tapestry that simultaneously landed laughs and showed off their talents.\"[104] Christy Lemire of *The Boston Globe* was positive of the song's incorporation in the film during the audition process due to its beautiful editing which makes \"it feels like a fresh take on the tried-and-true, bad-first-date montage.\"[105] The song was used in twelfth season of Brazilian soap opera *Malha\u00e7\u00e3o*.[106] The song was also used in the first season of *Supergirl,*[107] and in *Unpregnant.*[108] The song is used the musical *& Juliet* a coming-of-age stage musical featuring the music of Max Martin. For the *& Juliet (Original Broadway Cast Recording)*, Clarkson re-recorded the song along with the Lorna Courtney who plays Juliet.[109]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014, the song has appeared in more than 40 different albums either remixed or in its original format.[110] The song propelled Clarkson to success in mainstream pop music and was regarded as a power pop milestone in the 2000s.[16] Maura Johnston from *Billboard* asserted that \"the song inspired covers from all corners\u2014Ted Leo, Kidz Bop\u2014and helped prime the pop world for tracks like Pink's \"Who Knew\" and Paramore's \"Misery Business\", not to mention later Clarkson hits like \"My Life Would Suck Without You\".[111] *Entertainment Weekly* put it on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Can anyone do bitter better? Nothing packs more romantic rage than the original Idol's 2004 kiss-off to a coldhearted ex.\"[112] The song was ranked by *Pitchfork Media* as the 21st best track of the 2000s; they wrote that \"'Since U Been Gone' gave us one of the most blunt rallying cries of the last ten years, a perfectly realized sing-along chorus that will be a karaoke staple for years.\"[113] In 2014, *The Atlantic* magazine dubbed \"Since U Been Gone\" as the best pop song of the past decade.[114]\n\n\nBill Lamb of About.com ranked the song as the 29th best pop song of all time, expressing that \"Kelly Clarkson has stated that she insisted on adding the rock feel to the recording. The result was a record that captured the prevailing sound of mainstream pop with near perfection.\"[115] *NME* placed it at number 135 on its list of the \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\",[116] writing \"What should have been a slice of American schlock power-pop turned into a brilliant kiss-off, in any genre.\"[117] *The A.V. Club* staff rated the song as one of their favorite gleeful breakup songs, writing \"The minute that bass and drum machine start, this song is an anthem of the scorned, a call to self-actualization, and an instant hands-in-the-air dance party.\"[118] *Rolling Stone* ranked \"Since U Been Gone\" at number 482 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010, and later at 93 in the 2021 revamped ranking, whose readers listed it as the ninth-ranked single of the last decade.[119][120][121] The AOL Radio Staff put the song at number 10 on their list of 10 Best Break Up Songs.[122] \"Since U Been Gone\" has also appeared in several *Billboard* lists; in March 2013, it was ranked at number one on its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.[123] In April 2017, it appeared at number two of *Billboard'*s 100 greatest choruses of the 21st century[124] and is also one of Clarkson's biggest *Billboard* Hot 100 hits.[125]\nThe song has been ranked 342nd by *Billboard* on its 600 most

Written alongside producer Jazze Pha, it was released on November 1, 2004 as the second single of the former's debut studio album, *Goodies*. In the United States. It peaked within the top 10 of the charts in several countries worldwide, including Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song is heavily inspired by 1980s electro music production. Throughout the song, Ciara gives a description of how the song's beat feels as she exhorts party-goers to dance to the music. \"1, 2 Step\" was ranked 59th on *Billboard*'s Top 100 Songs of the 2000s.[2] In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and composition[edit]\n\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" is one of four songs Ciara and Jazze Pha originally recorded at Doppler Studios in Atlanta two years before the release of *Goodies*. It is explained that Ciara was inspired by Roscoe Blunt, leading to the creation of this song. \"The two connected so well, that half of the album was made within eight days or so.\"[3] Pha asked Missy Elliott to appear on the track and she accepted. Elliott recorded her rap verse at the Hit Factory Criteria in Miami.\n\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" is a Crunk&B track, which is strongly influenced by 1980s electro music. The song was created on one of Jazze Pha's five Akai MPC3000s. Pha used laser pulses from E-mu Proteus in the 2000s that were used for old school hip hop songs and b-boy break dance tracks. \"1, 2 Step\" is inspired by Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock.\" Jazze Pha thought about how he could create a more melodic version and \"shared some interesting ideas on what kind of music he would like to produce with her. Let's put it this way, it would be epic.\"[3] \"1, 2 Step\" references her past song \"Goodies\" and \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen. Missy Elliott's verse was inspired by Teena Marie's song \"Square Biz\".[4]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" received favorable reviews from music critics. *Contact Music* gave the song three out of five stars and called it \"arse shaking floor filling R&B\" and a \"wicked melodic souful twist.\"[5] Jason Birchmeier of *Allmusic* was published that the track is \"good, if not great.\"[6] Gerardo E. wrote it is \"a feel good track,\" something that is not overproduced but works its magic.\"[7] Kate Watkins of *The Situation* called it \"a funky song in the style we have come to expect from Missy.\"[8] *Fazed* stated that the song is about \"joys of dancing around with family.\"[9] *Slant* thought that \"1, 2 Step\" was a \"fun dance track.\"[10]\n\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for \"Best Rap/Sung Collaboration,\" but lost to \"Numb/Encore\" by Jay-Z and Linkin Park. The song also received a nomination at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Music Awards for \"Best Dance Cut.\" The song was nominated for \"Viewer's Choice\" at the 2005 BET Awards, but lost to Omarion's \"O.\" The song won the award \"Best Performed Songs in the ASCAP Repertory for the 2005 Survey Year,\" which included the title track from the album as well as third single, \"Oh.\" The song won the award for \"Choice Music R&B/Hip Hop Track\" at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards and \"Best Collaboration\" and \"Viewer's Choice\" at the BET Awards in 2005.\n\n\n\n## Chart performance[edit]\n\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" debuted at number 74 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. on October 30, 2004.[11] On the January 8, 2005, issue of *Billboard*, the song climbed to number two on the chart and stayed there for seven weeks, becoming Ciara's second top-10 single.[12] \"1, 2 Step\" reached number one on the Hot Dance Airplay and Top 40 Mainstream charts.[13][14] It also peaked within the top five on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Rhythmic Airplay charts and within the top 30 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.[15][16][17] \"1, 2 Step\" was ranked at number five for the year on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2005 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over three million digital copies in the United States.[18][19]\n\n\nInternationally, \"1, 2 Step\" was successful, reaching the top 10 in several countries. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, \"1, 2 Step\" entered and peaked at number three on both the UK and Irish Singles Charts.[20][21] In Ireland, the single stayed at three for three weeks. The song reached number two in Australia for one week and in New Zealand for two weeks.[22][23] It was a top-30 hit in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), France, the Netherlands, and Sweden.[24]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video for \"1, 2 Step\" was directed by Benny Boom. It takes place in an Atlanta dance studio and on the streets. R&B boy band, B5, makes a short appearance in the video, along with Lloyd and Lil Scrappy. Ciara can be seen teaching others the song's title \"one, two step\" dance, which is similar to the traditional grapevine.\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\nThe video begins with Ciara putting her *Goodies* CD in a radio, setting it to the \"1, 2 Step\" track, and pressing the play button. As the song begins, you see Jazze Pha reciting the introduction, featuring Elliott, and then finally Ciara herself. We see Ciara and her dancers, dancing in the Atlanta dance studio, and certain shots of her teaching her female friend the \"1, 2 Step\". We then see a clip of Ciara meeting up with B5 and performing the \"1, 2 Step\". Later, Ciara is seen dancing alone on the streets. While dancing at the studio, she looks behind her, and sees Elliott in the mirror, says she is just looking things. Then Elliott begins to rap her verse and they continue dancing with each other in front of the mirror, until the songs ends. During this time, we also see shots of Ciara teaching a group of young girls the dance and also, she meets a boy who is standing in front of his house and kind of gives him a flirtatious look. We also see four skaters, three male, and one female skater, skating in the streets and a last shot of Ciara and her dancers.\n\n\n\n## Track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **US 12-inch

She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three songs on the chart, two of which are in the top forty.\n\n\nList of songs on *Billboard*'s 2005 Year-End Hot 100 chart[2]\n| No.\n | Title\n | Artist(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | \"We Belong
