Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men \u2013 Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939\u20131942 release (roadshow/\u200bgeneral release/\u200bsecond-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry\u2014after it took back the record\u2014includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"The Fate of the Furious (2017)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nclub and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for.[73] It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment,[74] and at one point *Variety* estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50\u00a0million.[75] Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated.[65] While it is generally accepted that *Gone with the Wind* took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release\u2014which is true in terms of public exhibition\u2014it is likely it did not overtake *The Birth of a Nation* in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s.[73] *Gone with the Wind* itself may have been briefly overtaken by *The Ten Commandments* (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58\u201360\u00a0million[76][77] compared to *Gone with the Wind*'s $59\u00a0million;[78] if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 16\n | *Pirates of the Caribbean* | $4,522,015,850\n | 5\n | $904,403,170\n | *Dead Man's Chest* ($1,066,179,747)\n |\n| 1\n | *Dead Man's Chest* (2006) | $1,066,179,747 |\n| 2\n | *On Stranger Tides* (2011) | $1,045,713,802 |\n| 3\n | *At World's End* (2007) | $960,996,492 |\n| 4\n | *Dead Men Tell No Tales* (2017) | $794,861,794 |\n| 5\n | *The Curse of the Black Pearl* (2003) | $654,264,015\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 17\n | *Mission: Impossible \u2020* | $4,139,186,793\n | 7\n | $591,312,399\n | *Fallout* ($791,657,398)\n |\n| 1\n | *Fallout* (2018) | $791,657,398 |\n| 2\n | *Ghost Protocol* (2011) | $694,713,380 |\n| 3\n | *Rogue Nation* (2015) | $682,716,636 |\n| 4\n | *Dead Reckoning Part One* (2023) *\u2020* | $567,535,383 |\n| 5\n | *Mission: Impossible 2* (2000) | $546,388,108 |\n| 6\n | *Mission: Impossible* (1996) | $457,696,391 |\n| 7\n | *Mission: Impossible III* (2006) | $398,479,497\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7\u00a0billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10\n | *Frozen II* | $1,450,026,933\n | 2019\n | [# 24][# 25] |\n| 14\n | 14\n | *Barbie* \u2020\n | $1,441,740,954\n | 2023\n | [# 26][# 27] |\n| 15\n | 5\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* | $1,402,809,540\n | 2015\n | [# 28][# 21] |\n| 16\n | 15\n | *The Super Mario Bros.

Other sources put its earnings at $2\u00a0million,[55] which may suggest the higher figure is the worldwide rental, given the confusion over international figures during this period.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9\u00a0billion, *Avatar* is proclaimed to be the \"highest-grossing\" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2\u00a0billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2\u00a0billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345\u00a0million from the sale of sixteen\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3\u00a0billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021 | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111 ($1,912,233,593)\n | $200,000,000\n | [# 13][# 306] |\n| 2022 | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | $350,000,000\u2013460,000,000 | [# 5][# 307][# 308] |\n| 2023 | *Barbie* \u2020\n | $1,441,740,954\n | $128,000,000\u2013145,000,000 | [# 26][# 27] |\n\n\n(...)

Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *The Red Shoes* | $5,000,000\\*R | \u00a3505,581 (~$2,000,000)\n | [# 154][# 168][# 169] |\n| *The Snake Pit* | $4,100,000\\*R | $3,800,000 | [# 170][# 171] |\n| 1949 | *Samson and Delilah* | $14,209,250R | $3,097,563 | [# 172][# 97] |\n| 1950 | *Cinderella* | $263,591,415($20,000,000/$7,800,000R)\n | $2,200,000 | [# 173][# 174][# 175] |\n| *King Solomon's Mines* | $10,050,000R | $2,258,000 | [# 176] |\n| 1951 | *Quo Vadis* | $21,037,000\u201326,700,000R | $7,623,000 | [# 172][# 177][# 178] |\n| 1952 | *This Is Cinerama* | $50,000,000CI | $1,000,000 | [# 179][# 180] |\n| *The Greatest Show on Earth* | $18,350,000R GS | $3,873,946 | [# 181][# 182][# 97] |\n| 1953 | *Peter Pan* | $145,000,000 ($7,000,000)\\*R | $3,000,000\u20134,000,000 | [# 183][# 184] |\n| *The Robe* | $25,000,000\u201326,100,000R | $4,100,000 | [# 185][# 186][# 178] |\n| 1954 | *Rear Window* | $24,500,000\\* ($5,300,000)\\*R | $1,000,000 | [# 187][# 177] |\n| *White Christmas* | $26,000,050\\* ($12,000,000)\\*R | $3,800,000 | [# 188][# 189][# 190] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total: \"Toy Story (1995)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77\u201378% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8\u00a0million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799\u00a0billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2\u00a0billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640\u00a0million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2\u00a0billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5\u00a0billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120\u2013140\u00a0million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5\u00a0million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200\u2013250\u00a0million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260\u2013300\u00a0million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270\u00a0million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300\u00a0million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1\u00a0million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100\u00a0million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5\u00a0million, including $60\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3\u00a0million), and Sunday ($90.4\u00a0million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314\u00a0million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9\u00a0million on Monday and $33.1\u00a0million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4\u00a0million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3\u00a0million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600\u00a0million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8\u00a0million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700\u00a0million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2\u00a0million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3\u00a0million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800\u00a0million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1\u00a0million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2\u00a0million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680\u00a0million over its first five days for a global debut of $850\u2013950\u00a0million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280\u00a0million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5\u00a0million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2\u00a0million (RMB 189\u00a0million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1\u00a0million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300\u00a0million.[163] Overall, the film made $169\u00a0million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9\u00a0million), South Korea ($8.4\u00a0million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1\u00a0million), France ($6\u00a0million), and Italy ($5.8\u00a0million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866\u00a0million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5\u00a0million; RMB 2.22\u00a0billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($47.4\u00a0million), Mexico ($33.1\u00a0million), Australia ($30.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($26\u00a0million), Spain ($13.3\u00a0million), Japan ($13\u00a0million),[152] and Vietnam ($10\u00a0million).[180] It also made $21.6\u00a0million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($68.2\u00a0million), South Korea ($60.3\u00a0million), Mexico ($48.6\u00a0million), and India ($40.9\u00a0million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569\u00a0billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January\u00a02021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632\u00a0million), United Kingdom ($115\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million), Brazil ($86\u00a0million), and Mexico ($78\u00a0million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to *Avatar* (2009) and the second installment in the *Avatar* film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role,[6] while Kate Winslet joined the cast. It follows a blue-skinned humanoid Na'vi named Jake Sully (Worthington) as he and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan of Pandora, a habitable exomoon on which they live.\n\n\nCameron said in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to *Avatar* if it were successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five *Avatar* films, and the necessity to develop new technology to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350\u2013460\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\nAfter repeated delays in the expected release schedule, *Avatar: The Way of Water* premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on December 6, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 16. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.[10] It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing over $2.320\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *The Way of Water* one of the top-ten films of 2022. Among its many accolades, the film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Visual Effects. Three further sequels are in production, with the next film set to be released in December 2025.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nSixteen years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion of Pandora,[a] Jake Sully lives as chief of the Omatikaya clan and raises a family with Neytiri, which includes sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuk, and adopted daughter Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's inert avatar). Spider, the Pandora-born human son of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, frequently visits their children while being raised by the scientists who stayed on Pandora. To the Na'vi's dismay, the RDA, led by its new leader, Frances Ardmore, returns to colonize Pandora. Among the new arrivals are Recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human soldiers. Quaritch's Recombinant serves as their leader.\n\n\nA year later, Jake leads a guerilla campaign against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, but Spider is captured by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. After the RDA fails to get information from Spider, Quaritch decides to spend time with his son to draw him to his side. In turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language.\n\n\nAware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge of his whereabouts, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omatikaya and retreat to Pandora's eastern sea, where the Metkayina clan gives them refuge. There, the family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of Chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal.\n\n\nAfter defending Kiri against Tonowari's son Aonung, Lo'ak apologizes at Jake's insistence. Aonung and his friends then entice Lo'ak to a trip into a sea predator's territory and leave him stranded. Lo'ak is saved from the predator and befriended by Payakan, a Tulkun\u2014an intelligent and pacifist whale-like species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual brethren. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's friendship by taking the blame for the trip but is told that Payakan is an outcast among the Tulkun.\n\n\nLater, Kiri links to the Metkayina's underwater Spirit Tree and, in a vision, meets her biological mother, Grace, whose consciousness lives within Pandora. Kiri suffers a seizure during the link-induced trance and nearly drowns.\n\n\nJake summons Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help. They diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again, as doing so may kill her. Although Ronal saves Kiri, Quaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the archipelago where the Metkayina live. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with the RDA's marine operations, led by Captain Mick Scoresby, and commandeers a whaling vessel that hunts Tulkuns to extract anti-aging serums called amrita.\n\n\nQuaritch's squad raids the archipelago, interrogating the tribes about Jake's location to no avail. Quaritch then orders the whalers to kill Tulkuns near the villages to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that he was cast out because he went against the pacifist ways of his species and attacked the whalers who killed his mother, causing many deaths.\n\n\nWhen the Metkayina learns of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak rushes off to warn Payakan, followed by his siblings and friends. They find Payakan being hunted, and Quaritch captures Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan attacks the whalers, triggering a fight between the Metkayina and the humans. Spider cripples the vessel, and Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider but is fatally shot by one of Quaritch's men. Jake and Neytiri return to save their remaining children, who were recaptured. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage. When Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch initially denies their relationship but desists once Neytiri cuts Spider. Jake, Quaritch, Neytiri, and Tuk are trapped inside the sinking vessel. After a tense skirmish, Jake strangles Quaritch unconscious and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri recovers Neytiri and Tuk. Spider rescues Quaritch but refuses to go with him and rejoins Jake's family.\n\n\nAfter Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina. Still, the chief respectfully identifies Jake as part of the clan and welcomes him and his family to stay. Jake and his family accept their new lives at sea but vow to resume their campaign against the RDA.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Sam Worthington, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, James Cameron, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang at the press conference in Tokyo.\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become Na'vi and is now chief of the Omatikaya.[11][12]\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite (Neytiri Sully), the daughter of the previous clan chief, future Tsah\u00eck of the clan, and Jake's mate.[11][12]\n* Sigourney Weaver as Kiri te Suli Kireysi'ite (Kiri Sully), the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's Na'vi avatar who was adopted by Jake and Neytiri.[13] Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human scientist who took the side of the Na'vi and died during the conflict. Her Na'vi avatar is revealed to have birthed Kiri despite her death. Like most of the cast, she learned free-diving for the film and filmed scenes underwater.[14]\n\t+ Weaver also reprises her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, despite Weaver's saying in 2014 that she would not do so, though she and Cameron confirmed prior to then that she would return in the sequels:[6][15][16] she appears in this film in a video recording and in a spiritual vision in which she meets with Kiri.\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human military officer who led the paramilitary security division of the RDA in their conflict with the Na'vi.[17] After being killed by Neytiri in 2154, he is revived as a Recombinant[17] and seeks revenge against Jake and his family. Cameron said in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating, \"I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga.\"[18][19] He later said Quaritch would act as the main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.[20][21]\n\t+ Lang also reprises his role as the original human Quaritch of the first movie in a video recording made for his Recombinant self.\n* Kate Winslet as Ronal, a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife who is pregnant.[22][23] Winslet called Ronal \"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\" but also \"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\" since shooting all her scenes only took a month.[24] It marks her first time working with performance capture, and motion capture altogether. She, like most of the cast, also had to learn free diving for the film; while filming an underwater scene, she held her breath for over seven minutes, a new record for any film scene shot underwater.[14][24][25][26]\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the chief of the Metkayina clan and Ronal's husband[27][28][29]\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a former member of the Avatar Program who chose to side with the Na'vi in the first film.[30]\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omatikaya's Tsah\u00eck, and Neytiri's mother.[31][32]\n* Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore, the commander in charge of the RDA's interests.[33]\n* Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby, the head of an RDA private sector marine hunting vessel on the moon of Pandora.[34]\n* Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin, a marine biologist working for the RDA.[35]\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam te Suli Tsyeyk'itan (Neteyam Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 16-year-old son and oldest child.[36][37]\n\t+ Jeremy Irwin as young Neteyam.[38]\n\t+ Joel David Moore's son Oliver cameos as the infant Neteyam.[39]\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak te Suli Tsyeyk'itan (Lo'ak Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 14-year-old son.[36][37]\n\t+ Chloe Coleman as young Lo'ak.\n* Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuktirey \"Tuk\" te Suli Neytiri'ite (Tuktirey \"Tuk\" Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 8-year-old daughter and their youngest child.[36][37][40]\n* Jack Champion as Miles \"Spider\" Socorro, the 16-year-old son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was raised by scientists who stayed back on Pandora and wears Na'vi attire and an oxygen mask when outside a building. He is inseparable from Jake and Neytiri's children.[36][37][41]\n* Bailey Bass as Tsireya (\"Reya\"), a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal's daughter[36][37]\n* Filip Geljo as Aonung, a young male hunter, a free diver of the Metkayina, and Tonowari and Ronal's son[36][37]\n* Duane Evans Jr. as Rotxo, a young male hunter and free diver of the Metkayina[36][37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the former corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation, who appears in a recording made for Quaritch's Recombinant.[42][43][44]\n* Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who worked in the Avatar Program and came to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA in the first film.[45]\n* Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who fought and died in the RDA's battle against the Na'vi in 2154 where he was trampled by a Hammerhead titanothere. Following the RDA's return to Pandora, he is revived as a Recombinant and placed under Quaritch's command. Gerald was announced to reprise his role in August 2017.[29]\n\t+ Gerald also reprises his role as the original human Wainfleet from the first film shown in Quaritch's video recording.\n\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears uncredited as Zdinarsk, a Recombinant and member of the 1st Recom Squadron. Vela-Bailey previously portrayed Ikeyni, Saeyla, and a blonde woman in a bar in the original *Avatar*. She is also featured as a stunt performer in both films.[46][47] CJ Jones appears, also uncredited, as a Metkayina interpreter of the Na'vi sign language he created.[48] Keston John plays Tarsem, a member of the Omatikaya clan who succeeds Jake when he and his family flee to the Metkayina territories.\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\nFamily is the central concept featured in *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[49][50][51] *RogerEbert.com* critic Brian Tallerico notes that some of the themes in the film echo themes from earlier films directed by Cameron, including *Titanic*, *Aliens* (1986), *The Abyss* (1989), *The Terminator* (1984) and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991). For example, the film asks whether you should run and hide from a powerful enemy or fight their evil, similar to the *Terminator* films. The film also invokes themes of environmentalism and settler colonialism.[52] Comparing the themes of the sequels to the original, Cameron said \"It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you're gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you're probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you're probably gonna love these\".[53]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron speaking in 2010](image)Director James Cameron in 2010\nIn 2006, Cameron said if *Avatar* (2009) were successful, he would consider making two sequels.[7] In 2010, he said the sequels would proceed as planned as a result of the film's widespread success.[8] The sequels were originally scheduled for release in December 2014 and 2015.[9] He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups.[7][11] Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work \"once the novel is nailed down\".[54] He said the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus.[55] The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest.[56] He intended to capture footage for the sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible.[57] In 2011, Cameron said he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be \"strident\" since the film will concentrate on entertainment.[58] The sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri in December 2009.[12] Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story.[59] In 2011, Cameron said he would film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, to add a heightened sense of reality.[60]\n\n\nIn 2013, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500\u00a0million (approximately US$410\u00a0million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).[61][62]\n\n\nCameron mentioned a possible third sequel for the first time in 2012; and was officially confirmed the following year.[63][64] Cameron was then looking to release *Avatar 2* in 2015, but later that year, production was rescheduled for 2014, with the film to be released in December 2016, and to be followed by the two other sequels in 2017 and 2018.[65] By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year, with the first sequel expected to be released in December 2017; this was due to the writing process, which Cameron called \"a complex job\".[66][67] The following month, Fox announced a further release delay.[68] In February 2016, production of the sequels was scheduled to begin in April 2016 in New Zealand.[69] In April 2016, Cameron announced at CinemaCon that there will be four *Avatar* sequels, all of which will be filmed simultaneously.[70]\n\n\nNew crew members include cinematographer Russell Carpenter, who worked with Cameron on *True Lies* (1994) and *Titanic* (1997), and Aashrita Kamath, who will act as art director on all four sequels.[71][72][73] Kirk Krack, founder of Performance Freediving International, worked as a free-diving trainer for the cast and crew for the underwater scenes.[74] Several creatures that were first introduced in the Walt Disney World theme park attraction *Avatar Flight of Passage* were featured in the film.[75]\n\n\nIn 2019, after several media outlets shared rumors of potential titles for the *Avatar* sequels, including the name *Avatar: The Way of Water*, Cameron confirmed that the titles mentioned were \"among titles that are in consideration\" but had not been finalized at the time.[76]\n\n\nIn 2022, Cameron said that about ten minutes of \"gunplay action\" were cut from the film as he was no longer inclined to \"fetishize the gun\", although he is known as an \"action filmmaker\".[77]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron said the sequels were being written as \"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the second, and Shane Salerno for the third.[65] However, Friedman later clarified and said Jaffa and Silver were writing the first of the four sequels and he was writing the second.[78] In April 2014, Cameron expected to finish the (then) three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases.[79][80] He said although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first worked together on all three scripts: \"I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie.\"[65][81][82][18][78][83] Cameron added that they had \"worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga\", a creative process that was inspired by his experiences in the writing room of his television series *Dark Angel*.[84] The writing took longer than expected, forcing Cameron to delay the release of the films further in 2015.[66]\n\n\nHe spent a year writing the script for the first sequel titled *Avatar: The High Ground*, a 130-page treatment and then threw it out and started over because \"it didn't go enough into the unexpected,\" which is one of the critical elements about sequels, according to Cameron. At one point, he threatened to fire his writers because they would only focus on the new stories, rather than first figuring out what made the original movie a success.[85][86] In December 2015, in an interview with *Entertainment Weekly* Cameron said: \"I'm in the process of doing another pass through all three scripts [...] Just refining. That's in parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for about a year and a half. All the characters, settings and creatures are all pretty much [set].\"[87] On February 11, 2017, Cameron announced that the writing of all four sequels was complete.[88] In a November 26 interview the same year, he estimated that the scripts had taken four years to write overall.[53] One element in *The High Ground*, showing an outer space battle between Na'vi, humans and spaceships was cut; this was later used in the prequel novel of the same name. Cameron cited the omission of the sequel's core aspects, which were insufficient, as reasons for the removal.[89][90]\n\n\n\nDiscussing the character of Tuk in a February 2019 interview, Cameron mentioned that she was eight years old, and that the film would feature a scene between Jake and Neytiri taking place from Tuk's perspective: \"There's a three-page argument scene between Jake and Neytiri, a marital dispute, very, very critical to the storyline. I wound up shooting it all from the point of view of the 8-year-old hiding under the structure and peeking in. Having gone through the experience with [Sam Worthington] on *Avatar*, I now knew how to write the Jake character going forward across the emotional rollercoaster of the next four movies.\"[40][91] Cameron said the film addresses the implications of Jake and Neytiri becoming parents in the time that elapsed since the first film.[92] He said:\n\n\n> Becoming a parent changes so much of your behavior and your value system...What we saw in the first film were people who were fearless. Jake would throw himself off his ikran onto a leonopteryx (creatures featured in *Avatar*) but is a father of four going do that?...He's trying to keep his kids alive and trying to adjust his own life. Is he still a warrior? Are these young boys who are 14, 15, 16, coming up, getting all excited about wanting to go to war and fight for their people and for their land? How's [Jake] going to be a hypocrite and hold them back when he has to go do it?[92]\n> \n> \n\n In a December 2019 interview, Lang said his character was always meant to return in the sequels, as Cameron had shared with him \"that Quaritch had a future\" while shooting the original film.[93]\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Producer Landau, Worthington, Salda\u00f1a, Cameron, Weaver and Lang promoting the film in Tokyo\nSam Worthington and Zoe Salda\u00f1a were confirmed in January 2010 to have signed on to reprise their roles in the sequels.[11] Later that year, Cameron confirmed that both Weaver and Stephen Lang would return despite the demise of their characters.[18][15] Cameron also said Weaver would be featured in all three sequels (the fourth one was not planned at the time), and that her character, Grace Augustine, would be alive.[16] In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.[6] Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return as Quaritch in the first three sequels, stating, \"I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga.\"[18][19] In September 2015, Michelle Rodriguez said unlike Weaver and Lang, whose characters had also died in the first film, she would not return in *Avatar 2*.[94]\n\n\nSeveral new cast announcements were made in 2017, with Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Matt Gerald all confirmed to return from the first film.[31][32][29][30] Additionally, Cliff Curtis joined the cast as Tonowari, the leader of the Na'vi reef people clan of Metkayina.[27][29] On September 23, 2017, child actor Filip Geljo was revealed to have been signed in an undisclosed role.[95] On September 27, seven child actors were confirmed as a part of the main cast including Geljo: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as Jake and Neytiri's children; Geljo, Bailey Bass and Duane Evans Jr. as members of the Metkayina (together with Curtis); and Jack Champion, the only one to perform in live action, as a human born on Pandora.[36][37] Cameron later said the child cast had been trained for six months to prepare for the underwater scenes filmed in performance capture, and that they now could all hold their breath \"in the two- to four-minute range\", even then-seven-year-old Trinity Bliss, and were now \"all perfectly capable of acting underwater, very calmly while holding their breath\".[96][97]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2017, it was reported that Winslet, who starred in Cameron's *Titanic*, had joined the cast of *Avatar 2*, and possibly its sequels. Cameron commented: \"Kate and I had been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on *Titanic*, which was one of the most rewarding of my career\", and added that her character was named Ronal.[22][98][23] When asked by ComicBook.com on her reasons to return to work with Cameron, Winslet said he just asked her to play Ronal and she accepted out of a combination of her love for the first *Avatar* film, an attraction to the well-written and strong female role she was offered, a love for being on the water and to work with Cameron and the film's cast.[99] Although the nature of her character was originally unknown, the following month Cameron said Ronal was \"part of the Sea People, the reef people\", in reference to the Na'vi clan of Metkayina, making *Avatar 2* Winslet's first role via performance capture, or motion capture altogether, which she was looking forward to; since she insisted on performing all of her character's movements herself, she, like the child cast, had to learn free diving for the film.[53][24] Winslet, who had been notoriously reluctant about working with Cameron again because of the complicated situations he puts his actors in for their scenes, said Cameron proposed the role to her in July 2017 when he came to help her and their fellow *Titanic* collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio at a fundraiser in France, sending her the scripts shortly after.[24] She commented that her role was \"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\", as she would only have one month of shootings, but also \"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\".[24]\n\n\nOn October 13, 2017, it was announced that Giovanni Ribisi would reprise his role of Parker Selfridge from the first film, in all four upcoming *Avatar* films.[43] On January 25, 2018, Dileep Rao was confirmed to return as Dr. Max Patel. A year later, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell and Jemaine Clement joined the cast in live-action roles.[33][34][35] Marc Maron also auditioned for Clement's part.[100] Edward Norton turned down an undisclosed role in *Avatar 2*, due to only being interested in playing a Na'vi, which his proposed character was not.[101] Joel David Moore's then infant son, Oliver, filmed a brief cameo as an infant Neteyam.[39]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n#### Performance capture[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California, as the main shooting location.[102] Principal photography began on September 25, 2017, on a $350\u2013$460\u00a0million budget; the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.[2][3][103] It was simultaneously filmed with *Avatar 3* (2024).[104] As Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of *Doc Martin* (2004\u2013present).[105]\n\n\nOn November 23, Cameron said the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14, featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss.[53] He said \"we're getting really good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the code\".[96][97] The cast and crew did not use scuba sets as \"air bubbles might interfere with the accuracy of the sensors\". Another problem with underwater scenes was how the infrared light used in performance capture was not registered by the camera sensors as it was absorbed by the water, and so UV-light had to be used instead. Two separate performance capture systems were made; one used underwater, and another above the water, which had to work in sync with one another.[106] Cameron said that tests would last until January 2018, as \"we're still working in our small test tank. We graduate to our big tank in January\".[96] It was \"a dialogue scene\", as according to Cameron, the characters communicate via \"a kind of a sign language\".[53] The underwater fight scene between Worthington and Lang was difficult, based on their interviews. Worthington considered this a risky option because doing choke-outs can cause drowning. Overseen by a safety team during the shoot, the actors ensured their survival.[49][107]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Winslet had \"just a couple days\" of shooting left to do.[108] While filming an underwater scene, Winslet held her breath for over seven minutes, breaking the record for longest breath held while shooting a film scene underwater, a record previously held by Tom Cruise for *Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation* (2015).[14] In May 2018, Salda\u00f1a said filming was \"kind of only halfway done\" and that the crew is \"about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand.\"[109] Salda\u00f1a finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both *Avatar 2* and its sequel, while Cameron said around the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot.[25][26] On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.[21]\n\n\nPart of the movie was shot at 24 frames per second, but many fast scenes were filmed at 48 frames per second. This allows fast objects still to be clearly visible when moving, but it was also said that too detailed a view sometimes causes the viewer to see playing actors rather than story characters. The projector in the movie hall runs at 48 frames per second, for the 24 fps sections frames are duplicated.[110] To avoid the soap opera effect, Lightstorm Entertainment hired Pixelworks in 2020, which used their TrueCut Motion software to create \"motion grading\", a tool that ensure a movie keep its theatrical appearance.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Live-action[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Landau said live-action filming for *Avatar 2* and *3* would commence in New Zealand in the spring of 2019.[112] Cameron confirmed later the same month that they had \"only wrapped for [the motion capture parts]. Now, that is the vast majority of the characters and it is the vast majority of the running time of the film[s]. But that pesky little live action component is going to cost me five months of my life across the two movies.\"[113] Filming for 2019 concluded on November 29, to resume the following year in New Zealand.[114][115][116]\n\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Landau announced that the filming of the *Avatar* sequel films in New Zealand had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also confirmed that production would remain in Los Angeles.[117] However, virtual production continued in Manhattan Beach, California while visual effects continued at Weta Digital in Wellington.[118] In early May, health and safety production protocols had been endorsed by the New Zealand government, allowing filming to resume in the country.[119]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2020, Landau posted a picture of himself and Cameron on Instagram, showing that they had returned to New Zealand to resume filming. After their arrival, Cameron and 55 other crew members who had traveled to New Zealand started a 2-week government-supervised isolation period at a hotel in Wellington before they would resume filming. This would make *Avatar 2* and *3* the first major Hollywood blockbusters to resume production after postponing filming due to the pandemic.[120][121][122][123] On June 16, 2020, Cameron resumed filming and Landau posted a photo of his crew on Instagram filming the production.[124][125] The New Zealand production hired 46 New Zealand cast members including Cliff Curtis (Tonowari) and Duane Evans Jr. (Roxto), 114 local stunt artists, almost 800 extras, and 36 apprentices and interns.[126][127] In September 2020, Cameron confirmed that live action filming in New Zealand had been completed, therefore completing the shooting of the film altogether after over three years; he estimated *Avatar 3* to be \"95%\" completed, due to having live-action parts yet to be filmed outside of New Zealand.[128][129][130]\n\n\nIn July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the *Avatar* sequels had received over NZ$140\u00a0million worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant. By comparison, *The Hobbit* trilogy (2012\u20132014) had received NZ$161\u00a0million in film subsidies. While ACT party deputy leader Brooke van Velden criticised the Government's film subsidy programme for allegedly taking public funding from other areas, the Economic Development and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash argued that New Zealand's film subsidies for major Hollywood products brought much needed overseas investment and jobs to the New Zealand film industry.[131]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It's never been done before and it's very tricky because our motion capture system, like most motion capture systems, is what they call optical base, meaning that it uses markers that are photographed with hundreds of cameras. The problem with water is not the underwater part, but the interface between the air and the water, which forms a moving mirror. That moving mirror reflects all the dots and markers, and ... it creates thousands of false targets, so we've had to figure out how to get around that problem, which we did. ... It's taken us about a year and a half now to work out how we're going to do it.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Cameron, on blending underwater filming and motion capture system[132][133]\n\nOn July 31, 2017, it was announced that W\u0113t\u0101 FX had commenced work on the *Avatar* sequels.[134] The film heavily features underwater scenes, actually filmed underwater with the cast in performance capture.[96][97] Blending underwater filming and performance capture being a feature never accomplished before, it took the team a year and a half to develop a new motion capture system.[133][132] In December 2022, W\u0113t\u0101 FX's VFX producer David Conley describe *Avatar 2* as the biggest visual effects project that the company had ever undertaken, totalling nearly 3.3\u00a0billion thread powers. To cope with the huge amount of data, W\u0113t\u0101 used the services of cloud storage company Amazon Web Services.[135]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Landau said *Avatar 2* would have a number of major technological improvements since the first movie. A lot more of the lighting work on the virtual production stage could be done during production instead of post-production, and like *Alita: Battle Angel* (2019), which is produced and co-written by Cameron, the crew can use two lightweight HD head cams to record the actors' facial performance. In addition they also used two digital puppets instead of just one; one that is an accurate copy of the real actor, and another that is the actor's character, allowing the team to re-target one onto the other to make it as accurate as possible.[136][137]\n\n\nCameron said there was a possibility that the film could be shown in \"glasses-free 3D\", along with the sequels.[138][139] But he later disagreed with these rumors and did not think the technology would be there yet.[140]\n\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic (ILM) also returned to assist the VFX for the film after doing so with Weta for the final battle of the first film. ILM assisted in delivering 48 one-off VFX shots for the film's opening scenes.[141][142]\n\n\nThe film was completed on November 23, 2022.[143]\n\n\n\n### Runtime[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2022, *Empire* revealed the runtime was \"around three hours\" at that stage in production.[144] In November 2022, the film's runtime was revealed to be 192 minutes (three hours and twelve minutes).[1] In the *Empire* interview, Cameron said: \"I don't want anybody whining about length when they sit and binge-watch [television] for eight hours... I've watched my kids sit and do five one-hour episodes in a row. Here's the big social paradigm shift that has to happen: it's okay to get up and go pee.\"[145][146]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* is the second Disney-distributed film and the second 20th Century Studios film, after *Avengers: Endgame* and *Titanic* respectively, to exceed three hours in length.[147]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: The Way of Water* (soundtrack)\n\n*Avatar* composer James Horner was originally reported to score music for the franchise, before his death in a plane crash in June 2015.[148] In December 2019, Simon Franglen, who had previously worked with both Cameron and Horner as record producer and arranger since 1997's *Titanic*, including on *Avatar* (notably completing Horner's score for 2016's *The Magnificent Seven* after his passing), was reported to write music for the film.[149] Landau confirmed his involvement in the project in August 2021, while also associating with the forthcoming *Avatar* sequels.[150][151] Horner's score will be reused in the film, in addition to the original themes produced by Franglen.[151] The scoring for *Avatar: The Way of Water* officially began on July 29, 2022.[152] The soundtrack album was released on December 16, 2022, by Hollywood Records.[153][154] An expanded score album, featuring ten more tracks from the original score, followed four days later.[155]\n\n\nIn November 2022, it was reported that the film would feature an original song titled \"Song Chord\" which will be performed by Franglen and Zoe Salda\u00f1a.[156] The following month, it was announced that Canadian singer the Weeknd would contribute an original song \"Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength)\" to the film, produced by Franglen and Swedish supergroup Swedish House Mafia.[153][157]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nDisney extensively promoted *Avatar: The Way of Water* across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising.[158]\nAt the 2022 CinemaCon,[159] the new title for the sequel was officially announced and the first teaser trailer was debuted at the event,[160] along with four new first look images, showing off the adventures of the Na'vi on and off the coasts of Pandora.[6] It was theatrically showcased at the premiere of *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*,[161][162] and was later released online on May 9.[163] The teaser finished its first 24-hour online window with 148.6\u00a0million views,[164] including 23 million from China alone, according to Disney and 20th Century.[165][166] Grant Ridner of *GQ* commented: \"The trailer features minimal dialogue and primarily focuses on shots of the cerulean Pandora and its residents, as well as indigenous flora and fauna.\"[167] However, Stuart Heritage of *The Guardian* criticized the teaser, saying: \"There isn't a trace of premise here, or character, or any real action to speak of. Instead, we're given a minute and a half of nice-looking scenery. It's like being held hostage to look at someone's holiday photos.\"[168] Louis Chilton of *The Independent* also felt that the trailer \"feels rather too much like a tech demo, or the trailer for a long-gestating video-game sequel\".[169]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the teaser was edited by Disney ahead of the theatrical screenings of Pixar's *Lightyear*, where sequences featuring Sully holding a rifle and few guns were edited. According to Russ Burlingame of *Comic Book Resources*, the trailer was edited due to \"public sentiments to avoid glorifying gun violence\" as *Lightyear* released after the Robb Elementary School shooting incident,[170] while *TheWrap*'s Drew Taylor opined that the change was made on the request of Motion Picture Association for attaching the trailer with PG-rated films.[171] New set photos were released by *Empire* on June 30, showing Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis in their Na'vi forms,[172] and subsequent photos were released on the following day, showing Sigourney Weaver as Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage Na'vi daughter, Kiri.[13] Though the film was not promoted at the San Diego Comic-Con event, Lego released four new sets from the franchise as a part of the promotions.[173]\n\n\nEight minutes of the film's footage were showcased in 3D at the D23 Expo on September 10, 2022.[174][175] McFarlane Toys had launched several action figures based on the characters and creatures, which were unveiled at the event.[176] The collections were officially released on October 1.[177] A second excerpt from the film was shown during the credits of the *Avatar* re-release on September 23, which evidently varies in different versions and screenings.[178][179] The official trailer was released on November 2 at *Good Morning America*.[180][181] New poster characters were released on November 21, and the second and final trailer was also released then.[182][183] An 18-minute clip of \"never-seen-before\" footage from the film was exclusively released at the CCXP convention on December 2.[184] The footage features independent storylines surrounding Jake's character and events occurring several years since the first film.[185]\n\n\nDisney initiated the environmental global campaign, \"Keep Our Oceans Amazing\", to support the Nature Conservancy in the conservation of marine habitats and animal species.[158][186] A concept art book titled *The Art of Avatar: The Way of Water*, written by Tara Bennett with a foreword by Robert Rodriguez, was made available for pre-order in October 2022, and was set to be released simultaneously with the film.[187] Another book titled *Avatar The Way of Water: The Visual Dictionary* by Joshua Izzo is also set to be released with the film.[187]\n\n\n*Deadline Hollywood* estimated that advertisers paid more than $170\u00a0million for promos. Lightstorm Entertainment and Mercedes-Benz revealed the Vision AVTR concept car inspired by the film at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020. Amazon Echo enabled interactions for its Alexa virtual assistant based on the film, the first time it did so for any film. In China, Disney partnered with JD.com and Alipay for advertising, while Razer Inc. launched the Yaqi Orochi V2 Avatar computer mouse in the country themed after the film. NYX Professional Makeup owned by L'Or\u00e9al promoted a lineup of makeup products inspired by the film. Kellogg's launched an estimated 53 million *Avatar*-themed packages across its three labels. Motorola Mobility and Deutsche Telekom partnered with Disney to promote the film in Latin America and EMEA respectively.[188]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water's* world premiere was held on December 6, 2022, at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London.[189] The film began rolling out in theaters in some countries on December 14, 2022,[190] and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16, with distribution by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through the 20th Century Studios label.[191][192][193] The film is the first in the series to be released under Disney, since its acquisition of both 20th Century Studios and the rights to *Avatar* in 2019.[194][195] The film was released in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX and IMAX 3D formats. Select showings also had support for a dynamic high frame rate of up to 48 frames per second.[196] *The Way of Water,* alongside the forthcoming sequels, was released in Dolby Vision.[53] *The Way of Water* is one of the widest releases ever given for a Disney film, debuting on over 12,000 screens in the United States and Canada and 40,000 internationally.[197]\n\n\nThe 2023 Hollywood Professional Association Tech Retreat revealed that 1,065 individual Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) were created for the film's theatrical release. This includes specific variations of the film presented in formats such as 2D, 3D, HDR, 4K, varying light levels, aspect ratios and various audio formats, as well as 51 subtitled languages and 28 dubbed language variations. According to Disney's Motion Pictures Operations VP Kim Beresford, the film was divided into 15 reels (resulting in 6,338 portions) to be completed in time; allowing the DCP mastering team to begin creating delivery elements before the complete film was locked. Roughly 800 DCPs were reviewed for quality control five days prior to the film's release date. Walt Disney Studios' VP of Distribution Technology Mark Arana said: \"We had to turn our operation into a 24/7 support model.\" Additionally, Disney's distribution team invented a new system to create and keep track of the numerous versions as well as a cloud-based DCP mastering tool.[198][*excessive detail?*]\n\n\nThe film was subjected to eight delays, as the crew took more time on the writing, pre-production and visual effects process. Initially in late-2010, the film was scheduled for release in December 2014.[9] By mid-2013, Cameron originally intended *Avatar 2* to be released in December 2015,[65] which was subsequently delayed to 2016 and then to 2017.[67][66] In April 2016, Cameron announced four *Avatar* sequels which would be released in December 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023;[70] but, in March 2017, he said this film would not be released in 2018, due to extensive production and the visual effects process.[199]\n\n\nIn April 2017, a new release date of December 18, 2020, was announced, with all the other sequels: *Avatar* *3*, *4* and *5* releasing on December 17, 2021, December 20, 2024, and December 19, 2025, respectively.[200] However, following the announcement of the three upcoming *Star Wars* films,[201] in May 2019, the sequels were delayed another two years, with this film being scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021.[202] The release date was again deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in August 2020, a new release date of December 16, 2022, was announced.[196][203][191] Mentioning the delays, Cameron felt optimistic that they would not harm the films' success, likening *Avatar 2* to his films *Aliens* (1986) and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.[53][204] The film was also approved for release in China, making it one of the few Hollywood blockbusters to be greenlit for distribution in the country in 2022.[205]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* was released for digital download on March 28, 2023. It contains behind-the-scenes featurettes.[206] The film was released on June 7, 2023, on Disney+ and Max.[207][208] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (under the 20th Century Home Entertainment label) distributed *Avatar: The Way of Water* on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on June 20, 2023.[209] Disney will release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[210]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Theater attendees watching the film in 3D in Barcelona\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* grossed $684.1\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.636\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.320\u00a0billion.[4][5] It had a worldwide opening of $441.7 million, the eleventh-biggest of all time, and the third largest in the COVID-19 pandemic era, behind *Spider-Man: No Way Home* ($601\u00a0million) and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* ($452.4\u00a0million). IMAX accounted for $48.8\u00a0million, the second-highest global weekend ever for a film released in IMAX cinemas.[211][212] It is the highest-grossing film of 2022, the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[213][214] and the highest-grossing film of the pandemic era.[215]\n\n\nIt is the fourth film to reach the $1\u00a0billion milestone in the pandemic era after *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, *Top Gun: Maverick* and *Jurassic World Dominion*, as well as the sixth-fastest overall to reach the milestone at 14 days.[216][217] It crossed the $2\u00a0billion milestone on January 22, becoming the first film in the pandemic era and the sixth in history to reach the milestone. It is also the second-fastest to gross over $2\u00a0billion, reaching the milestone in 40 days.[218][219] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $531.7\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2022's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[220]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nBy December 14, 2022, prior to the film's release in the United States and Canada, *Boxoffice Pro* projected an opening weekend of $145\u2013179\u00a0million, and a total final gross of $574\u2013803\u00a0million.[221] The film made $53.2\u00a0million on its first day, including $17\u00a0million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to a $134.1\u00a0million weekend, nearly double the original's opening of $77\u00a0million, but coming in below expectations while finishing first at the box office.[222][223] *Deadline Hollywood* and *Variety* wrote that strong audience exit scores, the small day-to-day drop, limited competition from other films and the upcoming Christmas holiday all indicated likely strong legs at the box office.[3][224]\n\n\nThe film made $63.3\u00a0million in its second weekend, a drop of 53%,[225] and $95.6\u00a0million over the four-day Christmas weekend, remaining atop the box office.[226] Box office analysts partially attributed the December 2022 North American winter storm for the drop.[227][228] In the third weekend, it grossed $67.4\u00a0million for an increase of 6%, and also grossed $88.8\u00a0million through the four-day New Year weekend,[229][230] while becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2022 in the region.[231] It remained the highest-grossing film at the box office throughout its first seven weekends of release, the highest number of consecutive weekends for any film since the original *Avatar*.[232][233] It is also the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time in the US and Canada.[234]\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nOn the release day of *Avatar: The Way of Water*, Tianjin Maoyan Weiying Culture Media estimated that the film would make $357\u00a0million (\u00a52.5\u00a0billion) and $100\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[235] It grossed $57\u00a0million in the first week in China, according to Artisan Gateway. This included a gross of $51.3\u00a0million during the weekend. The box-office gross of the film was impacted by the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in the country. IMAX meanwhile reported that the film marked its best weekend ever in China, with a $15.8\u00a0million opening.[236] In the second weekend, the film grossed $25.9\u00a0million, for a drop of 55%,[237] and an increase of 42% during the New Year weekend with $36.9\u00a0million.[238] *Variety* predicted that it would continue to dominate the region due to lack of titles offering it competition.[239][240]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $307.6\u00a0million in 52 countries in its first week of release. The largest openings for the film by the end of the week were in China ($56.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($24.9\u00a0million), France ($21.7\u00a0million), Germany ($19.4\u00a0million) and India ($19.2\u00a0million).[211][212] In the second weekend, it grossed $168.6\u00a0million for a drop of 42%.[241] In the third weekend, it grossed $186.7\u00a0million, an increase of 6% from the previous weekend.[242] In the fourth weekend, it grossed $132.6\u00a0million for a drop of 30%, while becoming the highest-grossing film of the pandemic era outside the US and Canada.[243] The five largest-running total countries by February 26, 2023, are China ($249.8\u00a0million), France ($148.3\u00a0million), Germany ($138.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million) and the United Kingdom ($91\u00a0million). It became the highest-grossing film of all time in twenty box office territories, including Germany, France, Austria, Turkey and New Zealand.[244][245][246][247]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 436 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Narratively, it might be fairly standard stuff\u2014but visually speaking, *Avatar: The Way of Water* is a stunningly immersive experience.\"[248] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 68 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[249] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the first *Avatar*, while PostTrak reported 91% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 82% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3]\n\n\nPositive reviews focused on the visual spectacle of the film, and advocated seeing it in as large a format as possible.[10][250] *Chicago-Sun Times* critic Richard Roeper gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four stars, highlighting the film's visuals as \"some of the most dazzling, vibrant, and gorgeous images ever seen on screen.\"[251] *Variety* critic Owen Gleiberman praised the film as a \"dizzyingly spectacular sequel\" with \"miraculously sustained\" combat sequences, \"scenes that will make your eyes pop, your head spin and your soul race\" and \"state-of-the-art 3D (never in-your-face, just images that look and feel sculpted) [that] makes the film's every underwater glide feel as experiential as one that you're literally on.\" On the other hand, Gleiberman felt that the story is \"basic\" with a \"string of serviceable clich\u00e9s,\" \"bare-bones dialogue\" and little dimensionality to the characters.[252] *The Atlantic* critic David Sims said that the film will wow audiences and exhibit \"new delights...in the alien world of Pandora\" while noting that the film gets off to a slow start that is \"busy with plot details as the film updates the audience on the past decade-plus of Pandoran life.\"[253] Science writer Darren Naish praised the creature design and detailed alien world, saying the series would remain a \"mainstay of discussions in creature design and speculative biology for some time yet\".[254]\n\n\n*Los Angeles Times* critic Justin Chang hailed Cameron as \"one of the few Hollywood visionaries who actually merits that much-abused term\" and said the film will \"stun most of his naysayers into silence\", while also praising the film's tenderness and sentimentality.[255] *Entertainment Weekly* critic Leah Greenblatt summarized her review of *The Way of Water* saying that it \"created its own whole-cloth reality, a meticulous world-building as astonishing and enveloping as anything we've ever seen on screen \u2014 until that crown is passed, inevitably, in December 2024, the projected release date for *Avatar 3*.\"[256]\n\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the film was excessively long, and that the story was not substantial enough to justify the length.[10] *The New Yorker* critic Anthony Lane opined: \"The film is more than three hours long, some of it dangerously close to dawdling; not until the final third does Cameron apply the whip and remind us that, in the choreographing of action sequences, he remains unsurpassed.\"[257] *The Guardian* critic Peter Bradshaw was critical of the \"scathingly bland plot\" and noted that, despite the shift in setting, \"there isn't a single interesting visual image\".[258]\n\n\n*San Francisco Chronicle* reviewer Mick LaSalle called it \"a one-hour story rattling around in a 192-minute bag,\" while acknowledging that \"it looks pretty good,\" incorporating \"one of the best uses of 3-D to date, with visuals that seem to have been conceived in three dimensions.\"[259] *The Telegraph* critic Robbie Collin said that the film \"has no plot, no stakes and atrocious dialogue\" and that \"for all its world-building sprawl, *The Way of Water* is a horizon-narrowing experience \u2013 the sad sight of a great filmmaker reversing up a creative cul-de-sac.\"[260]\n\n\nThe *Toronto Star* commented that the film was poorly received by some indigenous peoples in Canada, being viewed as trying to portray the colonial struggles of an indigenous population, with reviewer Drew Hayden Taylor noting: \"It's also rather conventional in its own way and somewhat boring. Predictable. I've been involved in crooked card games with a less foreseeable storyline.\"[261]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar: The Way of Water*\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, *Avatar: The Way of Water* received nominations for Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Production Design; and won Best Visual Effects.[262] Its other nominations include two Annie Awards (winning both),[263] two British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[264] five Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[265] and two Golden Globe Awards.[266] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *The Way of Water* one of the ten-best films of 2022.[267][268]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar 3* and *Avatar 4*\n\n*The Way of Water* is the first of four planned sequels to *Avatar*. *Avatar 3* started filming simultaneously with this film in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Cast members from previous films, including Worthington, Salda\u00f1a, Lang, Weaver, Pounder, Winslet, Curtis, Ribisi, Moore, Rao, Gerald, Dalton, Bliss, Champion, Bass, and Geljo, have all been announced to return while Oona Chaplin, Michelle Yeoh, and David Thewlis will be playing new characters.[269][270][271][272]\n\n\nAccording to Kirk Krack, Cameron said that Avatar 3 will be 30% water, half of The Way of Water's 60%, and 4 and 5 15%.[106] The ocean scenes for the sequels were filmed simultaneously during the production of The Way of Water.[273]\n\n\nAlthough the last two sequels have been reportedly greenlit, in a November 2017 interview Cameron said\u00a0: \"Let's face it, if *Avatar 2* and *3* don't make enough money, there's not going to be a *4* and *5*\".[53] Thewlis later confirmed this in February 2018, stating \"they're making *2* and *3*, they're gonna see if people go and see them, and then they'll make *4* and *5*\".[274] Conversely in November 2018, Weaver said, after the first two sequels had completed main photography, that she was currently \"busy doing *Avatar 4* and *5*\", which several media outlets interpreted as confirmation that the last two sequels had started filming.[275][276][277]\n\n\nIn January 2019, in face of the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that both *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5* are being developed but have not been officially greenlit.[278] According to producer Landau in February 2019, Iger may have been misinterpreted. He said that *Avatar 4* and *5* \"are not only [greenlit]\" but also a third of *Avatar 4* has already been filmed.[279]\n\n\nFollowing the box-office success of *The Way of Water*, Cameron confirmed that the sequels are effectively greenlit. \"It looks like with the momentum that the film has now that we'll easily pass our break even in the next few days, so it looks like I can't wiggle out of this and I'm gonna have to do these other sequels,\" Cameron said in January 2023, adding: \"I know what I'm going to be doing the next six or seven years.\"[280] It was also confirmed that Brendan Cowell will reprise his role as Captain Mick Scoresby and will also feature the return of Payakan, the Tulkun who befriends Lo'ak.[281] Giovanni Ribisi will reprise his role as Parker Selfridge, with his character having a bigger role in the film after his brief cameo in *The Way of Water*.[282]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films with longest production time\n* List of most expensive films\n* List of highest-grossing films\n* List of underwater science fiction works\n* Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Avatar* (2009)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McClintock, Pamela; Couch, Aaron (October 29, 2022). \"'Avatar: The Way of Water' Runtime Sails Past Three Hours\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Abrams. The sequel to *Return of the Jedi* (1983), it is the seventh film in the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set thirty years after *Return of the Jedi*, *The Force Awakens* follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire. The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.\n\n\nThe film was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18. It was positively received by critics, who found it an action-packed film with the mix of new and familiar actors capturing the nostalgia of the original trilogy and giving the franchise new energy.[4] The film grossed $2.07\u00a0billion worldwide, breaking various box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release. It was nominated for five awards at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The film was followed by *The Last Jedi* (2017) and *The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), rounding out the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThirty years after the Battle of Endor,[a] the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to end the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who is missing.\n\n\nOn the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke's location from an old ally. First Order stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village, capture Poe, and kill the villagers. Poe's droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters Rey, a lone scavenger. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned with the First Order, saves Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name \"Finn\". As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and assumes Poe was killed after finding his jacket in the wreck. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the *Millennium Falcon* and escape Jakku.\n\n\nThe *Falcon* is discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the *Falcon*. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke approves General Hux's request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.\n\n\nAboard the *Falcon*, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed Luke's temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travel to the planet Takodana and meet with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds Luke's lightsaber. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz's offering, and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\n\n\nStarkiller Base destroys the New Republic and its four neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey, having realized that she had seen the map, and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper guard.\n\n\nAt the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been in low-power mode since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the *Falcon*, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth-name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han. Chewbacca shoots Kylo, injuring him, and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator.\n\n\nKylo pursues Rey and Finn into the woods. He incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is quickly defeated. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and defeats Kylo in a duel. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca saves Rey and the injured Finn, and they escape aboard the *Falcon*. As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes and erupts into a star. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which points to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.\n\n\nRey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 travel to Ahch-To on the *Falcon*. Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island and silently presents him with his lightsaber.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Star Wars* characters and List of *Star Wars* cast members\n\n![](image)The cast of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con International\n* Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A smuggler and captain of the *Millennium Falcon*[5][6]\n* Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: The last Jedi, who has gone into hiding[7][8]\n* Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: A leader of the Resistance[9][10]\n* Adam Driver as Kylo Ren: A leader of the Knights of Ren and a warlord of the First Order, who is the son of Han and Leia[11][12][13]\n* Daisy Ridley as Rey: A Force-sensitive scavenger[14]\n\t+ Cailey Fleming as young Rey[15]\n* John Boyega as Finn: A reformed First Order stormtrooper[14]\n* Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: A high-ranking X-wing fighter pilot of the Resistance[14][16]\n* Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata: A centuries-old and perceptive alien who owns a castle on the peaceful forest planet Takodana[17][18]\n* Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke: An enigmatic, genetically artificial leader of the First Order[14][19]\n* Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux: The commander of the First Order's Starkiller Base[14]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A humanoid protocol droid[20]\n* Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: Han's loyal Wookiee friend and co-pilot[21][22]\n\t+ Joonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems[23][24]\n* Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: A galactic explorer searching for Luke Skywalker[25][26]\n\n\nTim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb from *Return of the Jedi*, with Erik Bauersfeld and Kipsang Rotich returning their respective voices.[15] Kenny Baker, originally announced as part of the cast, was credited as \"consultant\" for R2-D2,[27][15] with Jimmy Vee performing some of the work for R2-D2.[28] Ewan McGregor has an uncredited vocal cameo as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Rey's vision sequence, while archival audio of Frank Oz and Alec Guinness as Yoda and Kenobi, respectively, are also used in the same scene; Oz recorded new dialogue for the film, but it was replaced with preexisting audio from *The Empire Strikes Back*.[29] *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* voice actor James Arnold Taylor, who has voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi in different *Star Wars* media, originally recorded Kenobi's dialogue, but his recordings were replaced with McGregor's.[30]\n\n\nGwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma, the commander of the First Order's legions of stormtroopers.[31][32] Dave Chapman and Brian Herring served as puppeteers for BB-8,[33] with Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz credited as \"Vocal Consultants\".[34] Ken Leung appears as Statura, an admiral in the Resistance.[35] Simon Pegg appears as Unkar Plutt, the Junk parts dealer on Jakku.[36][37] Greg Grunberg plays Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley, an X-wing pilot.[38][39] Kiran Shah plays Teedo, a scavenger on Jakku who rides a semi-mechanical Luggabeast.[15][40] Jessica Henwick appears as Jess \"Testor\" Pava or Jess Testor, an X-wing pilot.[41][42][43] Brian Vernel appears as Bala-Tik, the leader of the Guavian Death Gang.[44] Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais appear as Tasu Leech and Razoo Qin-Fee, members of the Kanjiklub Gang, a criminal organization.[15] Warwick Davis appears as Wollivan, a tavern-dweller in Maz Kanata's castle.[45][46] Anna Brewster appears as Bazine Netal, a First Order spy, also at Maz Kanata's castle.[15] Hannah John-Kamen appears as a First Order officer.[15] Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Kate Fleetwood play First Order Petty Officers, Thanisson and Unamo, respectively.[47][48] Billie Lourd, daughter of Carrie Fisher, appears as Connix, a lieutenant in the Resistance.[49][50] Members of the Resistance include Emun Elliott as Brance[51] and Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Korr Sella[52] while Harriet Walter appears as Kalonia, the doctor who tends to Chewbacca.[53][54] Mark Stanley appears as a Knight of Ren.[54] Sebastian Armesto portrays Lieutenant Mitaka and Pip Torrens portrays Colonel Kaplan, both serving the First Order.[15]\n\n\nDaniel Craig, Michael Giacchino, and Nigel Godrich cameo as stormtroopers.[55][56] Abrams' assistant, Morgan Dameron, appears as a Resistance officer,[57] while his father, Gerald W. Abrams, appears as Captain Cypress.[58] Dialect coach Andrew Jack portrays Resistance Major Caluan Ematt.[59] Additionally, Crystal Clarke, Pip Andersen,[60] Christina Chong,[61] Miltos Yerolemou,[62] Amybeth Hargreaves,[63] Leanne Best,[64] Judah Friedlander,[65] and Kevin Smith appear in minor roles.[66] Riot control stormtrooper FN-2199, who calls Finn a traitor during the battle on Takodana, was portrayed by stunt performer Liang Yang and voiced by sound editor David Acord.[67]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* creator George Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it.[68] In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company.[69] Speaking alongside Lucasfilm's new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: \"I always said I wasn't going to do any more and that's true, because I'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.\"[70]\n\n\nAs creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the *Star Wars* universe.[69] Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for *Episodes VII\u2013IX*, which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan F. Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer.[69] Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film.[71][72][73] Lucas' son Jett told *The Guardian* that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation\".[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: producer Kathleen Kennedy, writer and director J. J. Abrams, and writer Lawrence Kasdan speaking at 2015 San Diego Comic-Con\n*The Force Awakens*' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.[75] At the time of his hiring, Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments.[76] Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg, Lawrence Kasdan, Pablo Hidalgo, and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy.[77] Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\"[78] The writers decided to use Luke as the film's MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene.[78] Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel *Star Wars: Bloodline*).[79]\n\n\nSeveral directors were considered, including David Fincher,[80] Brad Bird,[81] Jon Favreau,[82] and Guillermo del Toro.[83] Bird was reportedly the \"top choice\" to helm the film, but his commitments to *Tomorrowland* forced him to withdraw.[84] Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job, even dropping out of *X-Men: Days of Future Past* in favor for the film.[85] Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio, while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project.[86][87][88][89] After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy,[90] J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013,[91] with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.[92] Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer.[93][94] Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.[95] The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013. That same day, Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties,[96] both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, California, New York City, Paris, and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks.[97] Abrams said the key to the film was that it return to the roots of the first *Star Wars* films and be based more on emotion than explanation.[98] In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.[99] In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that *Episodes VII\u2013IX* would not feature storylines from the *Star Wars* expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series *Star Wars Rebels*.[100]\n\n\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from *The Force Awakens*, such as Rey and Finn's last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams was collaborating with *The Last Jedi* director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with *The Rise of Skywalker*'s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that \"everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\".[101] Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.[102]\n\n\nA fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\"; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.[103]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been \"keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\"[104] He also said, \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different\u00a0[...] I made them completely different\u2014different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\"[105][106] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told *The Hollywood Reporter* that Lucas had seen the movie and \"liked it\".[107] In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, \"I think the fans are going to love it, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for.\"[108] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous *Star Wars* films.[109]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that *The Force Awakens* would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce *The Force Awakens* in the UK.[110] Osborne committed \u00a325\u00a0million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry.[111] According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, *The Force Awakens* ultimately received a total of \u00a331.6\u00a0million ($47.4\u00a0million) from the government.[112][113]\n\n\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of *The Force Awakens* for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[114] The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films *Star Trek* (2009) and *Star Trek Into Darkness* (2013).[115] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[116] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[117] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.[118]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nOpen auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of \"Rachel\" and \"Thomas\".[119] Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.[120] Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement.[121] Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013,[69] their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.[27]\n\n\nAbrams set out to have a more diverse cast than previous installments.[122] A very early report claimed the studio wanted Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron for roles.[123][124] In September 2013, Michael B. Jordan, Saoirse Ronan, and David Oyelowo were among the first to meet with the director.[125] In January 2014, *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed Benedict Cumberbatch, Jack O'Connell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alex Pettyfer, Jesse Plemons, Sullivan Stapleton, Tye Sheridan, Hugo Weaving, Michael Fassbender, and Adam Driver all met with Abrams for the film. The role Sheridan met for was ultimately rewritten to be played by a 40 year old actor, while Weaving was in talks for an \"Imperial commander\".[126] Ronan, Jordan, Frida Gustavsson, and later Miles Teller would go on to confirm their auditions for the film.[127][128][129][130] Industry publications speculated that Plemons could possibly be playing Luke Skywalker's son.[131] In February, Driver was in final negotiations for an unnamed villain, while Gary Oldman revealed he was approached for an undisclosed role.[132][133] In March, John Boyega, Plemons, Ray Fisher, Matthew James Thomas and Ed Speleers were Abrams' top choice for the lead role.[122] Boyega began talks after dropping out of the Jesse Owens biopic *Race*.[121] That same month, Lupita Nyong'o was said to have met also met with Abrams for the female lead.[134] In April 2014, Plemons and Thomas were no longer in contention for the film.[135] That same month, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, an \"unknown Oxford actress\", and Dev Patel were up for unknown roles.[136][137] Ronan, Richardson-Sellers, Eiza Gonzalez, Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Henwick auditioned for Rey.[138][139][140][141] Joseph David-Jones, Tom Holland, and Daryl McCormack were later reported to have auditioned for Finn while McCormack made it to the final round of auditions for the part.[142][143][144] Eddie Redmayne and Joel Kinnaman tested for Kylo Ren.[145][146]\n\n\nDaisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his *Girls* schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April.[121] Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have \"bored\" him.[147]\n\n\nIn April, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow were announced as part of the cast; while Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Baker reprised their roles from the original trilogy.[27] In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.[31] To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.[148] Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.[148] Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO,[149] but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him.[150] A flashback scene was cut from Rey's vision (following her discovery of Luke's lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in *The Empire Strikes Back*.[151]\n\n\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the *Star Wars* set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.[152] In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in *Return of the Jedi*, as well as Wald and Weazle in *The Phantom Menace* (1999), announced that he would appear in *The Force Awakens*, but did not reveal his role.[153] In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film.[49] Lourd first auditioned for the role of Rey prior to her casting.[154]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rub' Al Khali desert around Liwa Oasis in the United Arab Emirates was used as filming location for planet Jakku.\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.[98] The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[155] That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.[156] In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,[157] filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit.[158] Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35\u00a0mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format.[159] In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.[160]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.[161] The budget was initially estimated to be between $259\u00a0million and $306\u00a0million,[112][162] but in 2023 the actual cost was revealed to be $447 million.[2] Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built on location\u2014including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market\u2014and where explosives were used to create a \"blast crater\". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.[163] Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.[164]\n\n\n\n![view over Skellig Michael showing stone beehive structures and Small Skellig island in the distance](image)\n![concrete missile silo covered in grass](image)\nSkellig Michael in Ireland (top) and former RAF Greenham Common in England served as filming locations.\n\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the *Millennium Falcon* set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle\".[95] Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford's injury.[165] Ford's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.[166] A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly.[167] Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident,[95] but he kept this to himself for over a month.[168] In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.[169] Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95\u00a0million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.[170]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.[171] Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England.[172] Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August.[173][174] In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships.[175][176] Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes.[177] Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.[178]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, where Abrams supervised post-production of the film\nKennedy said *The Force Awakens* would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery.[179] Johnson reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\"[180] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original *Star Wars*.[181] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research,[182] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[183][184] The Holochess sequence was created using stop-motion, which was supervised by Tippett Studio and overseen by Phil Tippett, who also worked on the stop-motion sequence in the original *Star Wars* film.[185][186]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's *Star Wars* films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.[187] Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.[95] In August 2015, he gave the film's estimated running time of 124 minutes.[188] Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value [...] So we ended up leaving those things out.\"[189] The final cut of the film runs for 138 minutes.[190]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[191] In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the *Star Wars* universe, revealed that the working title for the film was *Shadow of the Empire* \"for the longest time\".[192]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (soundtrack)\n\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with *The Force Awakens*.[193] He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.[194][195] In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that \"there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.[196]\n\n\nRecording sessions for *The Force Awakens* began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.[197] The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.[198] Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.[199]\n\n\nThe score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score's part for nearly an hour. Williams' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus.[200] Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.[201] Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.[202] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.[203] Williams' score is more than two hours long.[195]\n\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical *Hamilton*, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.[204]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nDisney backed *The Force Awakens* with extensive marketing campaigns.[205][206] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the media value was $175\u00a0million;[207] its costs alongside home media revenues had later risen to $423\u00a0million by *The Guardian*.[208] On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store,[209] generating 58.2\u00a0million views on YouTube in its first week.[210] Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. *The Hollywood Reporter* called the trailer \"perfectly potent nostalgia\", praising its mix of old and new.[211] *Empire* was impressed by the continuity with the first films\u2014\"the *feel* of classic *Star Wars*\"\u2014but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters.[212] *The Guardian* wrote that the use of the *Star Wars* fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Large-scale outdoor advertising for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* in the city center of Nuremberg, Germany\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters.[214] On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the *Star Wars* Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was \"staggering [...] the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to\u2014other than a rock concert\u2014that felt quite like that\".[215] The trailer was viewed over 88\u00a0million times within the first 24 hours of release.[216] The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. *The Huffington Post*'s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer \"was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.\"[217]\n\n\n*Vanity Fair* was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to *The Force Awakens*. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz.[218] At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of *The Guardian* writing: \"The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.\" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, *Super 8*, saying \"the promos [...] are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.\"[219]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at *The Force Awakens* at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015.[220] Drew Struzan\u2014who designed the poster artwork for the previous *Star Wars* films\u2014produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees.[221] In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like \"orb\".[222] The trailer debuted during the halftime break of *Monday Night Football*, before being released online.[223] The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was \"frenzied\", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that \"perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals.\"[224] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* felt the trailer was \"a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned *Star Wars* aesthetic\".[225] The trailer received 128\u00a0million views in 24 hours. 16\u00a0million of the views came from its airing on *Monday Night Football*.[226] At the end of October, Air France announced a \"Flight and Cinema\" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film.[227] On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.[228]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a *Star Wars* marathon, airing the six previous *Star Wars* episode films in 2D, followed by *The Force Awakens* in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.[229]\n\n\n\n### Tie-in literature and merchandise[edit]\n\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, \"Journey to *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film's premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the *Star Wars* universe.[230] Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of *The Force Awakens* which was released in e-book form on December 18.[231] In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016.[231] Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of *The Force Awakens* between June and November 2016.[232]\n\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed \"Force Friday\" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for *The Force Awakens*. Beginning at 12:01\u00a0am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world.[233] Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015.[234][235] Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero.[182] Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling.[236][237] Many retailers, such as Toys \"R\" Us, were unable to meet demand for *Star Wars* products due to the event.[238]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSelect characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other *Star Wars* video games: Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts;[239] free downloadable content for Electronic Arts' *Star Wars Battlefront* reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku;[240] an update to the mobile game *Star Wars Commander*, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era;[241] and a condensed version of the film's plot becomes an add-on \"playset\" in the toys-to-life game *Disney Infinity 3.0*, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters.[242] Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled *Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.[243]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The premiere tent, with the film's poster above\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* premiered on December 14, 2015, at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[244] A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the \"massive\" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests.[245] The film was originally scheduled for a mid-2015 release, but in November 2013, it was pushed back to December 18, 2015.[246] It was also released in 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats.[247]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters,[248] of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations,[249][250] as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema.[251] Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record.[250] On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros.' *The Hobbit* trilogy to receive such a release.[252] The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of *The Revenant* (2015) and *The Finest Hours* (2016) in mid-January 2016.[253]\n\n\nAdvance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015,[254] and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing.[255][256] Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater.[257] In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5\u00a0million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1\u00a0million in pre-sales on a single day.[258] In total, it sold over $50\u00a0million in pre-sales, breaking the record.[259][260] This number was raised to $100\u00a0million including $50\u201360\u00a0million in advance ticket sales by December 14.[260][261] However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening [...] We have people buying *Star Wars* [*The Force Awakens*] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.\"[259] Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK,[262] Canada,[263] and Germany.[264]\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* is the first live-action *Star Wars* film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.[265] Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[3] and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles.[266] Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was \"for the fans\".[267]\n\n\nA poster from mainland China was criticized for being racist due to shrinking the size of the Black character Finn compared to non-Chinese posters.[268][269][270]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* through digital download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 5. Physical copies include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews,[271] and additional footage with eight bonus features.[272] In its first week, *The Force Awakens* sold 669,318 DVDs and 3.4\u00a0million Blu-rays as the most sold film on both formats in the United States.[273] That same week, *The Force Awakens* topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart with 83% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray.[274] Overall, *The Force Awakens* sold 2.1\u00a0million DVDs and 5.9\u00a0million Blu-rays, adding them up to get a total of 8\u00a0million copies, and made $191\u00a0million through home media releases.[273]\n\n\nA Blu-ray 3D \"collector's edition\" of the film was released on November 15, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by director J. J. Abrams.[275] The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features.[275]\n\n\nThe movie was rereleased on DVD in 2019 as part of the 9-disc \"Skywalker Saga\" boxed set. It received a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release on March 31, 2020. This 4K release was then included in the 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set on April 20, 2020.[276]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast syndication[edit]\n\n\nThe premium cable network Starz had U.S. broadcast syndication rights for *The Force Awakens* in January 2016,[277] just before the end of Starz's output deal covering most Disney films through 2015.[278] That September, *The Force Awakens* began broadcasting on all Starz networks.[279]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* grossed $936.7\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $1.132\u00a0billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068\u00a0billion,[3] making it the highest-grossing film of 2015[280] and the third highest-grossing film of all time.[281] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110\u00a0million tickets in the United States and Canada.[282] *The Force Awakens* earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by *Titanic* in 1997.[283] It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1\u00a0billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days.[284] It was also the third film in history to surpass $2\u00a0billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.[285] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $780.1\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[162]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first *Star Wars* film made more when this adjustment is made.[286] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[286]\n\n\nWhile *The Force Awakens* was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as India, other certain parts of Asia and Latin America. This was attributed to it being \"a retro film\" and how overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in North America.[287][288][289] The *Star Wars* franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for *The Force Awakens* heavily focused on appealing to that market.[288][290]\n\n\nNancy Tartaglione of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, *The Force Awakens* did well overseas.[289] While the film had special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also stated that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done.[288] Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [*The Force Awakens*] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\"[287] Moreover, Mike Fleming Jr. of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.00\".[291]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *The Force Awakens* was released on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57\u00a0million from Thursday night previews,[b] of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7\u00a0million from 391 screens.[295] On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1\u00a0million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record[296] and the first time a film has earned more than $100\u00a0million in a single day.[297] Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross[298] and a record of $247.9\u00a0million for its opening weekend.[273] The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders *The Avengers* (2012) ($207\u00a0million) and *Jurassic World* (2015) ($208\u00a0million).[299] The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1\u00a0million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters,[300][301] which nearly amounts to the $252.5\u00a0million total earned by *Return of the Jedi*\u2014the second-lowest-grossing film in the series\u2014in its original run.[302] 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78\u00a0million of the opening gross, setting a new record.[300] At that time, the film had the biggest December opening weekend, breaking the previous record held by *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012).[303] It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021) six years later.[304] Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2\u00a0million, to remain in first place at the box office[305] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.[306]\n\n\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following *Avatar*) to gross over $700\u00a0million in the United States and Canada,[307] and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.[308] On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800\u00a0million domestically unadjusted for inflation.[309] On February 5, *The Force Awakens* became the first film to earn over $900\u00a0million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada.[310][311] The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26\u201328, 2016,[312][313] and did not achieve $1\u00a0million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.[314]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.[315] It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1\u00a0million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.[316] It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6\u00a0million for a two-day international total of $72.7\u00a0million, reaching first place in all 44 markets.[317] It grossed a total of $129.5\u00a0million in three days after adding $56.8\u00a0million on its third day,[317] and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6\u00a0million.[318] It broke opening-day records in the United Kingdom ($14.4\u00a0million), Germany ($7.1\u00a0million), Australia ($6.8\u00a0million),[295] Sweden ($1.7\u00a0million), Norway ($1.1\u00a0million),[316] and in 12 other countries.[318] Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5\u00a0million) and Japan ($3\u00a0million).[317] After the five days, *The Force Awakens* had a total international opening gross of $281\u00a0million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening[315][319] and the third-biggest international opening of all time.[320] International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10\u00a0million were the United Kingdom ($50.6\u00a0million), Germany ($27.5\u00a0million), France ($22.5\u00a0million), Australia ($19.6\u00a0million), Japan ($13.4\u00a0million), and Russia ($12.3\u00a0million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.[315][321]\n\n\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529\u00a0million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history\u2014after *Jurassic World*\u2014that a film had opened to more than $500\u00a0million globally.[319][322] This included an IMAX opening record of $48\u00a0million.[322] Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19\u00a0million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70\u00a0million in 11 days.[323] IMAX generated $17.9\u00a0million from 276 IMAX theaters.[301] The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9\u00a0million.[324] The film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51\u00a0million.[325] As of February 2016, the highest-grossing markets outside of the United States and Canada were the United Kingdom ($180.7\u00a0million), China ($124.5\u00a0million), Germany ($109.7\u00a0million), Japan ($92.6\u00a0million), and France ($88.2\u00a0million).[326] On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1\u00a0billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.[327] It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by *The Revenant* in its sixth weekend.[328] In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.[328]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.[329] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 453 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, *The Force Awakens* successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy\".[4] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[330] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it either an \"A\" or a \"B\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% \"definite recommend\" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.[331]\n\n\nRobbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* said the film \"sets out to shake *Star Wars* from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past\", and \"it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\"[332] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* said that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot\", and it was \"ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\"[333] *Variety*'s Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans.\"[334] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* described it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure\".[335] Ann Hornaday, writing for *The Washington Post*, thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans\", and the film struck \"all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\"[336] *The Charlotte Observer*'s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\"[337] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best *Star Wars* sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015\".[338] Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best *Star Wars* film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike\".[339]\n\n\nTom Long of *The Detroit News* wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original *Star Wars*, it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind\", and \"the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured\".[340] The Tribune-Star called it \"basically the same\" as the original film but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"[341] Stephanie Zacharek of *Time* wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted\".[342] Reviewing for *Forbes*, Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture.\"[343] Brian Merchant of *Motherboard* said that the film \"is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod\", and that \"one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"[344] *RogerEbert.com*'s Gerardo Valero said the movie \"plagiarized\" *A New Hope* and resorted to nostalgia. He felt that it \"didn't [justify] a return to the universe\" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.[345]\n\n\n\n#### From *Star Wars* filmmakers[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a \"divorce\" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of *The Force Awakens*. Lucas described the previous *Star Wars* films as his \"children\" and criticized the \"retro feel\" of *The Force Awakens*, saying: \"I worked very hard to make [my films] completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships\u2014you know, to make it new.\" Lucas also likened Disney to \"white slavers\", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized.[346][347] In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas \"couldn't even hide his disappointment\" towards J. J. Abrams' interpretation. According to Iger, Lucas said, \"there's nothing new\" after seeing the film, and that \"there weren't enough visual or technical leaps forward\".[348][349] Lucas preferred Rian Johnson's sequel *The Last Jedi* and the anthology film *Rogue One* (2016).[350][351]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of *The Force Awakens*, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies.[352] However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards' slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors,[353] and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of *The Force Awakens*,[352] where it was named one of the top-ten films of 2015.[354]\n\n\nAt the 88th Academy Awards, *The Force Awakens* received nominations for Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects.[355] The film's other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.[356][357]\n\n\n\n### Fan backlash[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(June 2023)*\n |\n\n\nThe release of the first film trailer for *The Force Awakens* in 2015 spurred a racial backlash against the casting of Boyega, a Black British actor, in such a prominent role.[358] Some social media users called for a boycott of the film, which they accused of being \"anti-white\"[359] and of promoting \"white genocide\".[360] One such account promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory.[361] The character of Rey was also criticized as a too-perfect \"Mary Sue\" character by a group of fans who became known as the \"Fandom Menace\", who focused their ire at Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, whom they accused of spoiling the film franchise by including \"forced diversity\" and pro-feminist politics.[362]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* and *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*\n\n*The Force Awakens* was followed by *The Last Jedi* in 2017.[363] The film's plot follows the Resistance escaping from the First Order.[364] Like the previous film, *The Last Jedi* was a financial success and fared well with critics.[365]\n\n\nA sequel to *The Last Jedi* was released in 2019, titled *The Rise of Skywalker*.[366] As the conclusion to the Skywalker narrative,[367] it focuses on the Resistance assault on the Final Order, a reorganized First Order.[364] Critics' reactions to *The Rise of Skywalker* were mixed.[368][369]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Return of the Jedi* (1983)\n2. **^** The $57 million figure incorporates revenues generated from the \"*Star Wars* Marathon Event\" from 135 theaters in which all previous six *Star Wars* films were shown along with *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*. Ticket prices cost $59.99 for all the films (including *The Force Awakens*) at an average of $8.57 per movie.[292][293][294]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\".

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men \u2013 Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBox office\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Box office territory\n* Box-office bomb\n\t+ list\n* Fastest-grossing films\n* Second weekend box office\n\t+ highest-grossing second weekends\n* Sequels\n* Lists of box office number-one films\n\t+ most weekends at number one in North America\n* Four-wall distribution\n |\n| Highest-grossing | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Avatar (2009)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Palmeri, Christopher; Sakoui, Anousha (November 7, 2014). \"More Disney Fun and Games With 'Toy Story 4' in 2017\". *Bloomberg News*.

DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total: \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2\u00a0billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2\u00a0billion it grossed in theatres.

Leading the pack of postwar sex hygiene films was *Mom and Dad* (1944), which would become not only the most successful sex hygiene film in history but the biggest pre-1960 exploitation film of any kind. At the end of 1947, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that *Mom and Dad* had grossed $2\u00a0million. By 1949 *Time* had estimated that *Mom and Dad* had taken in $8\u00a0million from twenty\u00a0million moviegoers. And publicity issuing from *Mom and Dad*'s production company indicated that by the end of 1956 it had grossed over $80\u00a0million worldwide. Net rentals of around $22\u00a0million by 1956 would easily place it in the top ten films of the late 1940s and early 1950s had it appeared on conventional lists. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Spider-Verse | $1,066,057,504\n | 2\n | $533,028,752\n | *Across the Spider-Verse* ($690,516,673)\n |\n| 1\n | *Across the Spider-Verse* (2023) | $690,516,673 |\n| 2\n | *Into the Spider-Verse* (2018) | $375,540,831\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3\n | *Star Wars* | $10,324,504,714\n | 12\n | $860,375,393\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Skywalker Saga | $8,805,876,676\n | 9\n | $978,430,742\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Sequel trilogy | $4,474,907,761\n | 3\n | $1,491,635,920\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| 1\n | *VII \u2013 The Force Awakens* (2015) | $2,068,223,624 |\n| 2\n | *VIII \u2013 The Last Jedi* (2017) | $1,332,539,889 |\n| 3\n | *IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker* (2019) | $1,074,144,248\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4\n | Wizarding World | $9,656,055,269\n | 11\n | $877,823,206\n | *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* ($1,342,139,727)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Harry Potter *series** | $7,780,010,016\n | 8\n | $972,501,252\n | *Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* ($1,342,139,727)\n |\n| 1\n | *Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* (2011) | $1,342,139,727 |\n| 2\n | *Philosopher's Stone* (2001) | $1,009,046,830 |\n| 3\n | *Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1* (2010) | $977,070,383 |\n| 4\n | *Order of the Phoenix* (2007) | $942,201,710 |\n| 5\n | *Half-Blood Prince* (2009) | $934,483,039 |\n| 6\n | *Goblet of Fire* (2005) | $896,815,106 |\n| 7\n | *Chamber of Secrets* (2002) | $880,684,614 |\n| 8\n | *Prisoner of Azkaban* (2004) | $797,568,607\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Lego Batman Movie* (2017) | $311,950,384\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Catwoman* (2004) | $82,102,379\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Mask of the Phantasm* (1993) | $5,617,391\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | DC Universe Animated Original Movies | $4,501,125\n | 2\n | $2,250,563\n | *The Killing Joke* ($4,462,034)\n |\n| 1\n | *The Killing Joke* (2016) | $4,462,034 |\n| 2\n | *Batman and Harley Quinn* (2017) | $39,091\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1960s TV series | $3,957,343\n | 2\n | $1,978,672\n | *Batman: The Movie* ($3,900,000)\n |\n| 1\n | *Batman: The Movie* (1966)*\\*R* | $3,900,000 |\n| 2\n | *Return of the Caped Crusaders* (2016) | $57,343\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Quo Vadis*: p. 15 Archived April 4, 2023, at the Wayback Machine. \"MGM's most expensive film of the period, *Quo Vadis* (1951) also did extremely well.

Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhatever the foreign gross was, it seems unlikely that it was great enough to earn a profit for the picture.\n114. **^** Feaster, Felicia. \"Frankenstein (1931)\".
