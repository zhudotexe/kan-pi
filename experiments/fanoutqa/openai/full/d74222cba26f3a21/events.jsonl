Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)NATO member states as of 2023.\nNATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international military alliance consisting of 31 member states from Europe and North America. It was established at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949. Article 5 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be considered an attack against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary.[1] Article 6 of the treaty limits the scope of Article 5 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer, the North American and European mainlands, the entirety of Turkey, and French Algeria, the last of which is moot. Thus, an attack on Hawaii, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Ceuta or Melilla, among other places, would not trigger an Article 5 response.\n\n\nOf the 31 member countries, 29 are in Europe and two are in North America. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n\n\nAll members have militaries, except for Iceland, which does not have a typical army (but it does have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are nuclear weapons states: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO has 12 original founding member states. Three more members joined between 1952 and 1955, and a fourth joined in 1982. After the end of the Cold War, NATO added 15 more members from 1999 to 2023.[2]\n\n\n\nNATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden, and Ukraine as aspiring members as part of their Open Doors enlargement policy.[3]\n\n![](image)Map of NATO in Europe:Current members\nCountries in the process of accession\nCountries seeking membership\nCountries where membership is not a goal\nCSTO\n\n\n## Founding members and enlargement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Enlargement of NATO\n\nNATO was established on 4 April 1949 via the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty). The 12 founding members of the Alliance were: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[4]\n\n\nThe various allies all sign the Ottawa Agreement,[5] which is a 1951 document that acts to embody civilian oversight of the Alliance.[5][6]\n\n\nCurrent membership consists of 31 countries. In addition to the 12 founding countries, four new members joined during the Cold War: Greece and Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. NATO further expanded after the Cold War, adding the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (1999), Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004), Albania and Croatia (2009), Montenegro (2017), North Macedonia (2020), and Finland (2023).[4] Of the territories and members added between 1990 and 2023, all were either formerly part of the Warsaw Pact (including the formerly Soviet Baltic states) or territories of the former Yugoslavia except for Finland. No countries have left NATO since its founding.\n\n\nCurrently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now covers a total area of 27,131,087 km2 (10,475,371 sq mi), since the accession of Finland on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n### Membership aspirations[edit]\n\n\nAs of April 2023[update], four additional states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden and Ukraine.[3]\n\n\n\n* NATO members agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia and Ukraine \"will become members of NATO in the future\".[7]\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited by NATO to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in April 2010.[7]\n* In May 2022, Finland and Sweden simultaneously submitted official application letters to become NATO members.[8][9]\n\t+ Finland became a member on April 4, 2023.\n\t+ As of July 10, 2023, all members except Hungary and Turkey had ratified Sweden's accession protocol, with both committing to complete their approval by October.[10]\n\n\n## List of member states[edit]\n\n\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag | Map | Name | Capital\n | Date ofAccession[11] |

arrangements[edit]\n\n\nThe three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members, Denmark, Iceland and Norway, chose to limit their participation in three areas: there would be no permanent peacetime bases, no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity (unless invited) permitted on their territory. However, Denmark allowed the U.S. to maintain an existing base, Thule Air Base (now Pituffik Space Base), in Greenland.[17]\n\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\".[18] Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009, the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Military personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Comparison of military personnel per 1,000 capita.\n |\n| 50\n\n\n100\n\n\n150\n\n\n200\n\n\n250\n\n\n300\n\nCountries (see legend)\n\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* Greece\n* Portugal\n* Montenegro\n* Lithuania\n* Norway\n* Turkey\n* Latvia\n* Denmark\n* Croatia\n* North Macedonia\n* Romania\n* Hungary\n* United States\n* Bulgaria\n* Italy\n* France\n* Poland\n* Spain\n* Slovenia\n* United Kingdom\n* Slovakia\n* Canada\n* Germany\n* Netherlands\n* Albania\n* Belgium\n* Czech Republic\n* Luxembourg\n* Iceland\n |\n\n\nThe following list is constructed from *The Military Balance*, published annually by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers of military personnel\n| Country[21] | Active\n | Reserve | Para­mili­tary | Total\n | Per 1,000 capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| total | active\n |\n| ![Albania](image) | Albania | 10,500\n | 0\n | 500\n | 11,000\n | 3.6\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) | Belgium | 29,400\n | 5,900\n | 0\n | 35,300\n | 3\n | 2.5\n |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) | Bulgaria | 42,663\n | 3,000\n | 0\n | 45,663\n | 6.6\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Canada](image) | Canada | 70,500\n | 35,600\n | 5,500\n | 111,600\n | 2.9\n | 1.9\n |\n| ![Croatia](image) | Croatia | 16,700\n | 21,000\n | 3,000\n | 40,700\n | 9.7\n | 4\n |\n| ![Czech Republic](image) | Czech Republic | 27,400\n | 4,200\n | 0\n | 31,600\n | 3\n | 2.6\n |\n| ![Denmark](image) | Denmark | 20,440\n | 45,800\n | 0\n | 66,240\n | 11.2\n | 3.5\n |\n| ![Estonia](image) | Estonia | 7,600\n | 230,000\n | 15,800\n | 253,400\n | 207.7\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Finland](image) | Finland | 24,250\n | 900,000\n | 14,321\n | 938,571\n | 168.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| ![France](image) | France | 208,750\n | 141,050\n | 175,050\n | 524,850\n | 7.7\n | 3.1\n |\n| ![Germany](image) | Germany | 184,100\n | 50,050\n | 0\n | 234,150\n | 2.9\n | 2.3\n |\n| ![Greece](image) | Greece | 143,300\n | 221,350\n | 4,000\n | 368,650\n | 34.8\n | 13.5\n |\n| ![Hungary](image) | Hungary | 41,600\n | 20,000\n | 12,000\n | 73,600\n | 7.6\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Iceland](image) | Iceland | 250\n | 250\n | 250\n | 750\n | 2.1\n | 0.7\n |\n| ![Italy](image) | Italy[p] | 175,100\n | 18,300\n | 182,350\n | 375,750\n | 6\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Latvia](image) | Latvia | 16,700\n | 36,000\n | 0\n | 52,700\n | 28.3\n | 9\n |\n| ![Lithuania](image) | Lithuania | 23,000\n | 90,000\n | 14,150\n | 127,150\n | 46.9\n | 8.5\n |\n| ![Luxembourg](image) | Luxembourg | 940\n | 0\n | 600\n | 1,540\n | 2.4\n | 1.5\n |\n| ![Montenegro](image) | Montenegro | 2,350\n | 2,800\n | 10,100\n | 15,250\n | 25.1\n | 3.9\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) | Netherlands | 41,543\n | 6,643\n | 6,500\n | 54,686\n | 3.2\n | 2.4\n |\n| ![North Macedonia](image) | North Macedonia | 8,000\n | 26,850\n | 7,600\n | 42,450\n | 19.9\n | 3.8\n |\n| ![Norway](image) | Norway | 25,400\n | 40,000\n | 0\n | 65,400\n | 11.9\n | 4.6\n |\n| ![Poland](image) | Poland | 164,500\n | 200,000\n | 75,400\n | 439,900\n | 11.5\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) | Portugal | 33,200\n | 211,700\n | 24,700\n | 269,600\n | 26.3\n | 3.2\n |\n| ![Romania](image) | Romania | 72,000\n | 55,000\n | 79,900\n | 206,900\n | 9.7\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Slovakia](image) | Slovakia | 19,500\n | 0\n | 0\n | 19,500\n | 3.6\n | 3.6\n |\n| ![Slovenia](image) | Slovenia | 7,500\n | 26,200\n | 5,950\n | 39,650\n | 18.9\n | 3.6\n |\n| ![Spain](image) | Spain | 133,282\n | 15,450\n | 75,800\n | 224,532\n | 4.8\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Turkey](image) | Turkey | 640,811\n | 378,700\n | 156,800\n | 1,176,311\n | 14.3\n | 7.8\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) | United Kingdom | 196,453\n | 78,600\n | 0\n | 275,053\n | 4.2\n | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image) | United States | 1,456,870\n | 870,760\n | 0\n | 2,327,630\n | 6.9\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![NATO](image) | NATO | 3,845,002\n | 3,735,203\n | 870,271\n | 8,450,476\n | 8.9\n | 4\n |\n\n\n## Military expenditures[edit]\n\n\nMilitary spending of the US compared to 29 other NATO member countries (all except Finland) (US$ millions).[q]\n\n\n\nUnited States (70.46%)\nAll other NATO countries total[r] (29.53%)\n\nTotal military spending of NATO member countries except the United States and Finland (US$ millions).[q][s]\n\n\n\nGreece (1.58%)\nEstonia (0.21%)\nPortugal (1.09%)\nMontenegro (0.03%)\nLithuania (0.35%)\nNorway (2.34%)\nTurkey (4.54%)\nLatvia (0.23%)\nDenmark (1.55%)\nCroatia (0.35%)\nNorth Macedonia (0.035%)\nRomania (1.64%)\nHungary (0.67%)\nBulgaria (0.35%)\nItaly (7.99%)\nFrance (16.55%)\nPoland (3.91%)\nSpain (4.29%)\nSlovenia (0.18%)\nUnited Kingdom (19.72%)\nSlovakia (0.62%)\nCanada (7.15%)\nGermany (17.68%)\nNetherlands (4.05%)\nOther (2.895%)\n\n*United States and Finland omitted -

The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if it were to get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Roughly half or fewer in six of the eight countries surveyed say their country should use military force if Russia attacks a neighboring country that is a NATO ally. And at least half in three of the eight NATO countries say that their government should not use military force in such circumstances. The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany (58%), followed by France (53%) and Italy (51%). More than half of Americans (56%) and Canadians (53%) are willing to respond to Russian military aggression against a fellow NATO country. A plurality of the British (49%) and Poles (48%) would also live up to their Article 5 commitment. The Spanish are divided on the issue: 48% support it, 47% oppose.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Population data is based on a July 2021 estimate by the Central Intelligence Agency in *The World Factbook*.[12]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** Founding member of NATO.\n3. **^** Officially referred to by the name **Czechia**. *(See Czech Republic#Name.)*\n4. **^** Denmark consists of Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n5. **^** including Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n6. **^** Excluding all overseas territories of France apart from Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n7. **^** Germany initially joined NATO as West Germany.

The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows for the invitation of \"other European States\" only and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join must meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialog and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body. NATO was formed in 1949 with twelve founding members and has added new members nine times. The first additions were Greece and Turkey in 1952. In May 1955, West Germany joined NATO, which was one of the conditions agreed to as part of the end of the country's occupation by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own collective security alliance (commonly called the Warsaw Pact) later that month. Following the end of the Franco regime, newly democratic Spain chose to join NATO in 1982.\n\n\nIn 1990, the negotiators reached an agreement that a reunified Germany would be in NATO under West Germany's existing membership. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states sought to join NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became NATO members in 1999, amid much debate within NATO itself and Russian opposition. NATO then formalized the process of joining the organization with \"Membership Action Plans\", which aided the accession of seven Central and Eastern Europe countries shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Two countries on the Adriatic Sea—Albania and Croatia—joined on 1 April 2009 before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit. The next member states to join NATO were Montenegro on 5 June 2017, and North Macedonia on 27 March 2020.\n\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022 after Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, falsely claimed that NATO military infrastructure was being built up inside Ukraine and that Ukraine's potential future membership was a threat. Russia's invasion prompted Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership in May 2022.[1] Finland joined on 4 April 2023, while the ratification process for Sweden is ongoing.[2][3] Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 after Russia proclaimed the annexation of its territory.[1] Two other states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia.[4] Kosovo also aspires to join NATO.[5] Joining the alliance is a debate topic in several other European countries outside the alliance, including Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, Malta, Moldova, and Serbia.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Past enlargements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Member states of NATO\n\n### Cold War[edit]\n\n\n![Four men stand behind podiums with their country names of France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States, in front of a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower.](image)Negotiations in London and Paris in 1954 ended the allied occupation of West Germany and allowed for its rearmament as a NATO member.\nTwelve countries were part of NATO at the time of its founding: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of Eastern Europe, backed by the Soviet Union. As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952.[7][8]\n\n\nThe US, France, and the UK initially agreed to end its occupation of Germany in May 1952 under the Bonn–Paris conventions on the condition that the new Federal Republic of Germany, commonly called West Germany, would join NATO, because of concerns about allowing a non-aligned West Germany to rearm. The allies also dismissed Soviet proposals of a neutral-but-united Germany as insincere.[9] France, however, delayed the start of the process, in part on the condition that a referendum be held in Saar on its future status, and a revised treaty was signed on 23 October 1954, allowing the North Atlantic Council to formally invite West Germany. Ratification of its membership was completed in May 1955.[10] That month the Soviet Union established its own collective defense alliance, commonly called the Warsaw Pact, in part as a response to West German membership in NATO.[11] In 1974, Greece suspended its NATO membership over the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.[12]\n\n\nRelations between NATO members and Spain under dictator Francisco Franco were strained for many years, in large part because Franco had cooperated with the Axis powers during World War II.[13] Though staunchly anti-communist, Franco reportedly feared in 1955 that a Spanish application for NATO membership might be vetoed by its members at the time.[14] Franco however did sign regular defense agreements with individual members, including the 1953 Pact of Madrid with the United States, which allowed use of its air and naval bases in Spain.[15][16] Following Franco's death in 1975, Spain began a transition to democracy, and came under international pressure to normalize relations with other western democracies. Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez, first elected in 1976, proceeded carefully on relations with NATO because of divisions in his coalition over the US's use of Spanish bases. In February 1981, following a failed coup attempt, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo became Prime Minister and campaigned strongly for NATO membership, in part to improve civilian control over the military, and Spain's NATO membership was approved in June 1982.[16][17] A Spanish referendum in 1986 confirmed popular support for remaining in NATO.[18]\n\n\nDuring the mid-1980s the strength and cohesion of the Warsaw Pact, which had served as the main institution rivaling NATO, began to deteriorate. By 1989 the Soviet Union was unable to stem the democratic and nationalist movements which were rapidly gaining ground. Poland held multiparty elections in June 1989 that ousted the Soviet allied Polish Workers' Party and the peaceful opening of the Berlin Wall that November symbolized the end of the Warsaw Pact as a way of enforcing Soviet control. The fall of the Berlin Wall is recognized to be the end of the Cold War and ushered in a new period for Europe and NATO enlargement.[19]\n\n\n\n### German reunification[edit]\n\n\n![Eight men in suits stand in a hall facing forward.](image)Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other negotiators during the first round of talks for the Two Plus Four Treaty\nNegotiations to reunite East and West Germany took place throughout 1990, resulting in the signing of the Two Plus Four Treaty in September 1990 and East Germany officially joining the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, the treaty prohibited foreign troops and nuclear weapons from being stationed in the former East Germany,[20] though an addendum signed by all parties specified that foreign NATO troops could be deployed east of the Cold War line after the Soviet departure at the discretion of the government of a united Germany.[21][22] There is no mention of NATO expansion into any other country in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification.[23] Whether or not representatives from NATO member states informally committed to not enlarge NATO into other parts of Eastern Europe during these and contemporary negotiations with Soviet counterparts has long been a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars.[24][25]\n\n\nWith several countries threatening to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet military relinquished control of organization in March 1991, allowing it to be formally dissolved that July.[26][27]\nThe so-called \"parade of sovereignties\" declared by republics in the Baltic and Caucasus regions of the Soviet Union and their War of Laws with the government in Moscow further fractured its cohesion. Following the failure of the New Union Treaty, the leadership of the remaining constituent republics of the Soviet Union, starting with Ukraine in August 1991, declared their independence and initiated the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which was completed in December of that year. Russia, led by President Boris Yeltsin, became the most prominent of the independent states.[28] The Westernization trend of many former Soviet allied states led them to privatize their economies and formalize their relationships with NATO countries, the first step for many towards European integration and possible NATO membership.[29][30]\n\n\n\n![An older white male in a dark suit speaks at a wide wooden podium.](image)In December 1997, Russian President Boris Yeltsin described NATO expansion as a threat to Russia.\nBy August 1993, Polish President Lech Wałęsa was actively campaigning for his country to join NATO, at which time Yeltsin reportedly told him that Russia did not perceive its membership in NATO as a threat to his country. Yeltsin however retracted this informal declaration the following month,[31] writing that expansion \"would violate the spirit of the treaty on the final settlement\" which \"precludes the option of expanding the NATO zone into the East.\"[32][33] During one of James Baker's 1990 talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Baker did suggest that the German reunification negotiations could have resulted in an agreement whereby \"there would be no extension of NATO's jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east,\"[34] and historians like Mark Kramer have interpreted it as applying, at least in the Soviets' understanding, to all of Eastern Europe.[35][36][25] Gorbachev later stated that NATO expansion was \"not discussed at all\" in 1990, but, like Yeltsin, described the expansion of NATO past East Germany as \"a violation of the spirit of the statements and assurances made to us in 1990.\"[23][33][37]\n\n\nThis view, that informal assurances were given by diplomats from NATO members to the Soviet Union in 1990, is common in countries like Russia,[25][20] and, according to political scientist Marc Trachtenberg, available evidence suggests that allegations made since then by Russian leadership about the existence of such assurances \"were by no means baseless.\"[24] Yeltsin was succeeded in 2000 by Vladimir Putin, who further promoted the idea that guarantees about enlargement were made in 1990, including during a 2007 speech in Munich.[38][37] This impression was later used by him as part of his justification for Russia's 2014 actions in Ukraine and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[39][23]\n\n\n\n### Visegrád Group[edit]\n\n\n![Three men in dark suits sit at a table covered in a red tablecloth signing documents, around them stand others in dark suits.](image)Václav Havel, József Antall, and Lech Wałęsa signed the treaty establishing the Visegrád Group in February 1991.\nIn February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia formed the Visegrád Group to push for European integration under the European Union and NATO, as well as to conduct military reforms in line with NATO standards. Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts. Debate within the American government as to whether enlargement of NATO was feasible or desirable began during the George H.W. Bush administration.[40] By mid-1992, a consensus emerged within the administration that NATO enlargement was a wise realpolitik measure to strengthen Euro-American hegemony.[40][41] In the absence of NATO enlargement, Bush administration officials worried that the European Union might fill the security vacuum in Central Europe, and thus challenge American post-Cold War influence.[40] There was further debate during the Presidency of Bill Clinton between a rapid offer of full membership to several select countries versus a slower, more limited membership to a wide range of states over a longer time span. Victory by the Republican Party, who advocated for aggressive expansion, in the 1994 US congressional election helped sway US policy in favor of wider full-membership enlargement, which the US ultimately pursued in the following years.[42] In 1996, Clinton called for former Warsaw Pact countries and post-Soviet republics to join NATO, and made NATO enlargement a part of his foreign policy.[43]\n\n\nThat year, Russian leaders like Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev indicated their country's opposition to NATO enlargement.[44] While Russian President Boris Yeltsin did sign an agreement with NATO in May 1997 that included text referring to new membership, he clearly described NATO expansion as \"unacceptable\" and a threat to Russian security in his December 1997 National Security Blueprint.[45] Russian military actions, including the First Chechen War, were among the factors driving Central and Eastern European countries, particularly those with memories of similar Soviet offensives, to push for NATO application and ensure their long-term security.[46][47] Political parties reluctant to move on NATO membership were voted out of office, including the Bulgarian Socialist Party in 1997 and Slovak HZDS in 1998.[48] Hungary's interest in joining was confirmed by a November 1997 referendum that returned 85.3% in favor of membership.[49] During this period, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.[50]\n\n\nWhile the other Visegrád members were invited to join NATO at its 1997 Madrid summit, Slovakia was excluded based on what several members considered undemocratic actions by nationalist Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar.[51] Romania and Slovenia were both considered for invitation in 1997, and each had the backing of a prominent NATO member, France and Italy respectively, but support for this enlargement was not unanimous between members, nor within individual governments, including in the US Congress.[52] In an open letter to US President Bill Clinton, more than forty foreign policy experts including Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Gary Hart, Paul Nitze, and Robert McNamara expressed their concerns about NATO expansion as both expensive and unnecessary given the lack of an external threat from Russia at that time.[53] Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined NATO in March 1999.[54]\n\n\n\n### Vilnius Group[edit]\n\n\nUS President George W. Bush at the NATO Accession Ceremony for Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia\nAt the 1999 Washington summit NATO issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\" for Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in order to standardize the process for new members.[55] In May 2000, these countries joined with Croatia to form the Vilnius Group in order to cooperate and lobby for common NATO membership, and by the 2002 Prague summit seven were invited for membership, which took place at the 2004 Istanbul summit.[56] Slovenia had held a referendum on NATO the previous year, with 66% approving of membership.[57]\n\n\nRussia was particularly upset with the addition of the three Baltic states, the first countries that were part of the Soviet Union to join NATO.[58][56] Russian troops had been stationed in Baltic states as late as 1995,[59] but the goals of European integration and NATO membership were very attractive for the Baltic states.[60] Rapid investments in their own armed forces showed a seriousness in their desire for membership, and participation in NATO-led post-9/11 operations, particularly by Estonia in Afghanistan, won the three countries key support from individuals like US Senator John McCain, French President Jacques Chirac, and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder.[59] A 2006 study in the journal *Security Studies* argued that the NATO enlargements in 1999 and 2004 contributed to democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe.[61]\n\n\n\n### Adriatic Charter[edit]\n\n\nCroatia also started a Membership Action Plan at the 2002 summit, but was not included in the 2004 enlargement. In May 2003, it joined with Albania and Macedonia to form the Adriatic Charter to support each other in their pursuit of membership.[62] Croatia's prospect of membership sparked a national debate on whether a referendum on NATO membership needed to be held before joining the organization. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader ultimately agreed in January 2008, as part of forming a coalition government with the HSS and HSLS parties, not to officially propose one.[63] Albania and Croatia were invited to join NATO at the 2008 Bucharest summit that April, though Slovenia threatened to hold up Croatian membership over their border dispute in the Bay of Piran.[64] Slovenia did ratify Croatia's accession protocol in February 2009,[65] before Croatia and Albania both officially joined NATO just before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit, with little opposition from Russia.[66]\n\n\nMontenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006; the new country subsequently joined the Partnership for Peace program at the 2006 Riga summit and then applied for a Membership Action Plan on 5 November 2008,[67] which was granted in December 2009.[68] Montenegro also began full membership with the Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants in May 2009.[69][70] NATO formally invited Montenegro to join the alliance on 2 December 2015,[71] with negotiations concluding in May 2016;[72] Montenegro joined NATO on 5 June 2017.[73]\n\n\n\n![Two adult white men in dark suits signing documents on an outdoor table in front of two other men similarly dressed and two flags.](image)Prime Minister Zoran Zaev supported the 2018 Prespa Agreement, which allowed North Macedonia to complete accession to NATO.\nNorth Macedonia joined the Partnership for Peace in 1995, and commenced its Membership Action Plan in 1999, at the same time as Albania. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Greece blocked a proposed invitation because it believed that its neighbor's constitutional name implies territorial aspirations toward its own region of Greek Macedonia. NATO nations agreed that the country would receive an invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute.[74] Macedonia sued Greece at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over Greece's veto of Macedonia's NATO membership. Macedonia was part of the Vilnius Group, and had formed the Adriatic Charter with Croatia and Albania in 2003 to better coordinate NATO accession.[75]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled he would consider alternative names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. The naming dispute was resolved with the Prespa Agreement in June 2018 under which the country adopted the name North Macedonia, which was supported by a referendum in September 2018. NATO invited North Macedonia to begin membership talks on 11 July 2018;[76] formal accession talks began on 18 October 2018.[77] NATO's members signed North Macedonia's accession protocol on 6 February 2019.[78] Most countries ratified the accession treaty in 2019, with Spain ratifying its accession protocol in March 2020.[79] The Sobranie also ratified the treaty unanimously on 11 February 2020,[80] before North Macedonia became a NATO member state on 27 March 2020.[81][82]\n\n\n\n### Finland[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Finland–NATO relations\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Sanna Marin and President Sauli Niinistö announced Finland's intent to apply to NATO on 15 May 2022.\nFor much of the Cold War, Finland's relationship with NATO and the Soviet Union followed the Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine, whereby the country joined neither the Western nor Eastern blocs. Finland joined the Partnership for Peace in 1994, and provided peacekeeping forces to both NATO's Kosovo and Afghanistan missions in the early 2000s.[83]\n\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, opinion polling for the first time showed a clear majority of Finns supported joining NATO.[84][85][86] On 15 May, Prime Minister Marin announced at a joint press conference with President Niinistö that Finland would apply for NATO membership.[87] On 17 May, the Parliament of Finland voted 188–8 in favor of joining NATO,[88] and a formal application was submitted for NATO membership on 18 May 2022.[89] On 1 March 2023, the Parliament of Finland approved Finland's accession to NATO by a vote of 184 in favor and 7 opposed.[90] Most countries approved Finland's application throughout 2022, but Hungary and Turkey held out over disputes until early 2023, with the Hungarian parliament approving the application on 27 March, and the Turkish parliament approved the application on 31 March 2023. Finland became a member of the alliance on 4 April 2023, the 74th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty being signed.[91]\n\n\nAccording to the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Finland's accession to NATO had significantly increased the risk of a wider conflict in Europe. Russia has 'threatened counter measure' by increasing the announced placement of nuclear weapons in Belarus. The move had doubled the length of the border that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization shares with Russia.[92][93] Putin however consistently dismissed Finland's and Sweden's accession to NATO[94] stating it poses \"no threat to Russia\".[95]\n\n\n\n### Summary Table and Map[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date\n | Enlargement\n | Country\n | ![A map of Europe with nine colors that refer to the year different countries joined the alliance.](image) |\n| 18 February 1952\n |  | First\n | ![](image) Greece |\n| ![](image) Turkey |\n| 9 May 1955\n |  | Second\n | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 30 May 1982\n |  | Third\n | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3 October 1990\n |  | —\n | ![](image) German reunification |\n| 12 March 1999\n |  | Fourth\n | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| ![](image) Hungary |\n| ![](image) Poland |\n| 29 March 2004\n |  | Fifth\n | ![](image) Bulgaria |\n| ![](image) Estonia |\n| ![](image) Latvia |\n| ![](image) Lithuania |\n| ![](image) Romania |\n| ![](image) Slovakia |\n| ![](image) Slovenia |\n| 1 April 2009\n |  | Sixth\n | ![](image) Albania |\n| ![](image) Croatia |\n| 5 June 2017\n |  | Seventh\n | ![](image) Montenegro |\n| 27 March 2020\n |  | Eighth\n | ![](image) North Macedonia |\n| 4 April 2023\n |  | Ninth\n | ![](image) Finland |\n\n\n## Criteria and process[edit]\n\n\n### Article 10 and the Open Door Policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: NATO open door policy\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty is the basis of the organization, and, as such, any changes including new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty. The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join NATO:\n\n\n\n\n> The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty. Any State so invited may become a Party to the Treaty by depositing its instrument of accession with the Government of the United States of America. The Government of the United States of America will inform each of the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.[96]\n> \n> \n\n\nArticle 10 poses two general limits to non-member states. First, only European states are eligible for new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward that have to be attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria. However, for instance, Greece blocked the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO for many years because it disagreed with the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.[97]\n\n\nSince the 1991 Rome summit, when the delegations of its member states officially offered cooperation with Europe's newly democratic states, NATO has addressed and further defined the expectations and procedure for adding new members. The 1994 Brussels Declaration reaffirmed the principles in Article 10 and led to the \"Study on NATO Enlargement\". Published in September 1995, the study outlined the \"how and why\" of possible enlargement in Europe,[98] highlighting three principles from the 1949 treaty for members to have: \"democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law\".[99]\n\n\nAs NATO Secretary General Willy Claes noted, the 1995 study did not specify the \"who or when,\"[100] though it discussed how the then newly formed Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council could assist in the enlargement process,[101] and noted that on-going territorial disputes could be an issue for whether a country was invited.[102] At the 1997 Madrid summit, the heads of state of NATO issued the \"Madrid Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation\" which invited three Central European countries to join the alliance, out of the twelve that had at that point requested to join, laying out a path for others to follow.[98] The text of Article 10 was the origin for the April 1999 statement of a \"NATO open door policy\".[103]\n\n\n\n### Membership Action Plan[edit]\n\n\nThe biggest step in the formalization of the process for inviting new members came at the 1999 Washington summit when the Membership Action Plan (MAP) mechanism was approved as a stage for the current members to regularly review the formal applications of aspiring members. A country's participation in MAP entails the annual presentation of reports concerning its progress on five different measures:[104]\n\n\n\n* Willingness to settle international, ethnic or external territorial disputes by peaceful means, commitment to the rule of law and human rights, and democratic control of armed forces\n* Ability to contribute to the organization's defense and missions\n* Devotion of sufficient resources to armed forces to be able to meet the commitments of membership\n* Security of sensitive information, and safeguards ensuring it\n* Compatibility of domestic legislation with NATO cooperation\n\n\nNATO provides feedback as well as technical advice to each country and evaluates its progress on an individual basis.[105] Once members agree that a country meets the requirements, NATO can issue that country an invitation to begin accession talks.[106] The final accession process, once invited, involves five steps leading up to the signing of the accession protocols and the acceptance and ratification of those protocols by the governments of the current NATO members.[107]\n\n\nIn November 2002, NATO invited seven countries to join it via the MAP: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.[108] All seven invitees joined in March 2004, which was observed at a flag-raising ceremony on 2 April. After that date, NATO numbered 26 allies.[109] Other former MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, Montenegro between December 2009 and June 2017, and North Macedonia between April 1999 and March 2020, when it joined NATO. As of 2022[update], there was only one country participating in a MAP, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[110]\n\n\n\n### Intensified dialogue[edit]\n\n\nIntensified Dialogue was first introduced in April 2005 at an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Vilnius, Lithuania, as a response to Ukrainian aspirations for NATO membership and related reforms taking place under President Viktor Yushchenko, and which followed the 2002 signing of the NATO–Ukraine Action Plan under his predecessor, Leonid Kuchma.[105] This formula, which includes discussion of a \"full range of political, military, financial and security issues relating to possible NATO membership ... had its roots in the 1997 Madrid summit\", where the participants had agreed \"to continue the Alliance's intensified dialogs with those nations that aspire to NATO membership or that otherwise wish to pursue a dialog with NATO on membership questions\".[111]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Georgia became the second to be offered the Intensified Dialogue status, following a rapid change in foreign policy under President Mikhail Saakashvili[112] and what it perceived as a demonstration of military readiness during the 2006 Kodori crisis.[113] Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia similarly received offers at the April 2008 Bucharest summit.[114] While its neighbors both requested and accepted the dialog program, Serbia's offer was presented to guarantee the possibility of future ties with the alliance.[115]\n\n\n\n## Current status[edit]\n\n\n![Map of Europe with countries in six different colors based on their affiliation with NATO](image)|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Members of NATO\nAccession protocol signed\nMembership Action Plan\n | Enhanced Opportunity Partner\nIndividual Partnership Action Plan\nPartnership for Peace[Note 1]\n |\n\nAs of 2023, four states have formally expressed their desire to join NATO. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only country with a Membership Action Plan, which together with Georgia, were named NATO \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting on 7 December 2011.[116] Ukraine was recognized as an aspirant country after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. In 2022, NATO signed protocols with Finland and Sweden on their accession following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine applied for membership in 2022. Finland joined NATO on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO Aspirant Countries[117]\n| Country[4] | Partnership for Peace[118] | Individualized Action Plan[119] | Intensified Dialogue\n | Membership Action Plan[120] | Application\n | Accession Protocol\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Bosnia and Herzegovina](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina[121] | 2006–12 December 2006\n | 2008-01IPAP September 2008\n | 2008-04 April 2008[122] | 2010-04 December 2018[123][Note 2] |  |  |\n| ![Georgia (country)](image) Georgia[125] | 1994-03 March 1994\n | 2004–10IPAP October 2004\n | 2006–09 September 2006[126] |  |  |  |\n| ![Sweden](image) Sweden | 1994-05 May 1994\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | 18 May 2022[127] | 5 July 2022[3](29/31 ratified[128])\n |\n| ![Ukraine](image) Ukraine | 1994-02 February 1994\n | 2002–11 Action Plan November 2002[Note 3] | 2005-04 April 2005[130] | —[Note 4] | 30 September 2022[132] |  |\n\n\n1. **^** Membership Action Plan and Individual Partnership Action Plan countries are also Partnership for Peace members.

Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country. Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Partnership for Peace in 2006, and signed an agreement on security cooperation in March 2007.[133] Bosnia and Herzegovina began further cooperation with NATO within its Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008.[121] The country then started the process of Intensified Dialogue at the 2008 Bucharest summit.[122] The country was invited to join the Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants in September 2008.[134]\n\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina within Bosnia and Herzegovina has expressed willingness to join NATO, however, it faces consistent political pressure from Republika Srpska, the other political entity in the country, alongside its partners in Russia. On 2 October 2009, Haris Silajdžić, the Bosniak Member of the Presidency, announced official application for Membership Action Plan. On 22 April 2010, NATO agreed to launch the Membership Action Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but with certain conditions attached.[124] Turkey is thought to be the biggest supporter of Bosnian membership, and heavily influenced the decision.[135]\n\n\nThe conditions of the MAP, however, stipulated that no Annual National Programme[*clarification needed*] could be launched until 63 military facilities are transferred from Bosnia's political divisions to the central government, which is one of the conditions for the OHR closure.[136][137] The leadership of the Republika Srpska has opposed this transfer as a loss of autonomy.[138] All movable property, including all weapons and other army equipment, is fully registered as the property of the country starting 1 January 2006.[139] A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 decided that a disputed military facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[140] Despite the fact that all immovable property is not fully registered, NATO approved the activation of the Membership Action Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and called on Bosnia to submit an Annual National Programme on 5 December 2018.[123]\n\n\nA February 2017 poll showed that 59% of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very divided depending on ethnic groups. While 84% of those who identified as Bosniak or Croat supported NATO membership, only 9% of those who identified as Serb did.[141] Bosnian chances of joining NATO may depend on Serbia's attitude towards the alliance, since the leadership of Republika Srpska might be reluctant to go against Serbian interests.[142] In October 2017, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska passed a nonbinding resolution opposing NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina.[143] On 2 March 2022, Vjosa Osmani, the President of Kosovo, called on NATO to speed up the membership process for Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Osmani also criticized Aleksandar Vučić, the President of Serbia, accusing him of using Milorad Dodik to \"destroy the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina\".[144]\n\n\n\n### Sweden[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sweden–NATO relations\n\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine led to Finland and Sweden applying for membership on 18 May 2022.[145] The move met opposition from Turkey, which called for the Nordic countries to lift their non-existent arms sales ban on Turkey and to stop any support for groups which Turkey and others have labeled as terrorists, including the Kurdish militant groups Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) (that Sweden banned in 1984) and Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK) and Democratic Union Party (Syria) (PYD) and People's Defense Units (YPG), and of the followers of Fethullah Gülen, a US-based cleric accused by Turkey of orchestrating the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.[146][147] NATO leadership and the United States have said they were confident Turkey would not hold up the two countries' accession process. Additionally, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly also held talks with Turkey to convince the Turkish government of the need for the two Nordic nations' integration.[148]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Madrid summit in June 2022, Turkey agreed to support the membership bids of Finland and Sweden,[149][150] leading to NATO immediately inviting both countries to join the organization without going through the Membership Action Plan process.[2] The ratification process for Sweden and Finland began on 5 July 2022.[3] As of 15 October 2022[update], all NATO member states except for Hungary and Turkey have approved the accession of the two countries and deposited their instruments of accession with the Government of the US.[151]\nOn 1 February 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that he had a positive view of Finland's membership, and a negative view of Sweden's membership due to the Qur'an burning incidents in Sweden.[152]\n\n\n\n![A man in a white naval uniform salutes two men, one in camouflage and one in a blue uniform, who walk towards him while a large blue and yellow Swedish flag is held next to them.](image)Sweden has close relations with NATO and its member states, and participates in annual training exercises like the BALTOPS exercise in the Baltic Sea.\nIn 1949, Sweden chose not to join NATO and declared a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war.[153] A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war.[*clarification needed*] This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War era.[154] These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force.[155][156] Sweden has been an active participant in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).[157]\n\n\nRussia's military actions in Ukraine, first in 2014 and later in 2022, have caused most major political parties in Sweden to at least re-evaluate their positions on NATO membership, and many moved to support Swedish membership. The Centre Party, for example, was officially opposed to NATO membership until September 2015, when party leadership under Annie Lööf announced that it would move to change the party policy to push for Sweden to join NATO at its next party conference. The Christian Democrats likewise voted to support NATO membership at their October 2015 party meeting.[158] The center-right Moderate Party and center-left Liberal Party have both generally supported NATO membership since the end of the Cold War, with the Moderates even making it their top election pledge in 2022.[159][160] When the eurosceptic nationalist Sweden Democrats adjusted their stance in December 2020 to allow for NATO membership if coordinated with neighboring Finland, a majority of the members of the Swedish Riksdag for the first time belonged to parties that were open to NATO membership,[161] and a motion to allow for future NATO membership passed the parliament that month by 204 votes to 145.[162][163][164]\n\n\n\n![Two women in dark blue coats stand behind a podium looking to the left.](image)Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson held talks in March 2022 with her Finnish counterpart Sanna Marin about potential NATO memberships for both countries.\nSupport for NATO membership over this period steadily increased, with polling by the SOM Institute showing it growing from 17% to 31% between 2012 and 2015.[165] Events like the annexation of Crimea and reports of Russian submarine activity in 2014, as well as a 2013 report that Sweden could hold out for only a week if attacked, were credited with that rise in support.[166] A May 2017 poll by Pew also showed that 48% supported membership, and in November 2020, it showed that 65% of Swedes viewed NATO positively, the highest percent of any non-NATO member polled.[167][168] A Novus poll conducted in late February 2022 found 41% in favor of NATO membership and 35% opposed.[169] On 4 March 2022, a poll was released that showed 51% support NATO membership, the first time a poll has shown a majority supporting this position.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken deposits the US Instruments of Ratification with the Depositary for the North Atlantic Treaty in August 2022\nThe ruling Swedish Social Democratic Party, however, had remained in favor of neutrality and non-alignment for many years,[171] but following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the party debated the issue internally in April 2022[172] and announced on 15 May 2022 that it would now support an application to join the organization.[173] Among its coalition partners, the Green Party remain opposed,[174] while the Left Party would like to hold a referendum on the subject, something Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has rejected.[175] Andersson announced Sweden would indeed apply for NATO membership on 16 May 2022, in coordination with neighboring Finland,[176] and a formal application was submitted on 18 May 2022,[145] despite Russian threats of \"military and political consequences.\"[177] As with neighboring Finland, the application was at least initially opposed by Turkey, which accused the two countries of supporting Kurdish groups PKK, PYD and YPG that Turkey views as terrorists,[178] and of the followers of Fethullah Gülen, whom Turkey was accused of orchestrating the alleged unsuccessful 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.[179] On 20 May, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Ann Linde pushed back against Erdoğan's claim they support PKK, calling it \"disinformation\", and pointing out Sweden listed PKK as a terrorist organization in 1984, while the EU followed suit in 2002.[180] Turkey later agreed, on 28 June 2022, to support Sweden's membership bid.[149][150] In January 2023 and in view of the continued Turkish refusal to agree to Swedish NATO membership Jimmie Åkesson of the Sweden Democrats reasoned that there were limits to how far Sweden would go to appease Turkey \"because it is ultimately an anti-democratic system and a dictator we are dealing with\".[181] Just prior a NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023, Erdoğan linked Sweden's accession to NATO membership to Turkey's application for EU membership. Turkey had applied for EU membership in 1999, but talks made little progress since 2016.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### Georgia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Georgia–NATO relations\n\n![A woman with dark hair and a white suit jacket speaks behind a podium and in front of a blue NATO flag and red and white Georigan flag.](image)Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili speaking following meetings with NATO representatives in 2021\nGeorgia moved quickly following the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties with NATO[184] (although the previous administration had also indicated that it desired NATO membership a year before the revolution took place[185]). Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit, where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the organization.[186] Complications in the relationship between NATO and Georgia includes the presence of Russian military forces in internationally recognized Georgian territory as a result of multiple recent conflicts, like the 2008 Russo-Georgian War over the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are home to a large number of citizens of Russia. On 21 November 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev while addressing soldiers in Vladikavkaz near the Georgian border stated that Russia's 2008 invasion had prevented any further NATO enlargement into the former Soviet sphere.[186]\n\n\nA nonbinding referendum in 2008 resulted in 77 percent of voters supporting NATO accession.[187] In May 2013, Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili stated that his goal was to get a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for his country from NATO in 2014.[188] In June 2014, diplomats from NATO suggested that while a MAP was unlikely, a package of \"reinforced cooperation\" agreements was a possible compromise.[189] Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed that this could include the building of military capabilities and armed forces training.[190]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that \"NATO approaching our borders is a threat to Russia.\"[191] He was quoted as saying that if NATO accepts Georgian membership with the article on collective defense covering only Tbilisi-administered territory (i.e., excluding the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are currently an unrecognized breakaway republics supported by Russia), \"we will not start a war, but such conduct will undermine our relations with NATO and with countries who are eager to enter the alliance.\"[192]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on Georgia to use every opportunity to move closer to the Alliance and speed up preparations for membership. Stoltenberg stressed that earlier that year, the Allies agreed to further strengthen the NATO-Georgia partnership, and that NATO welcomed the progress made by Georgia in carrying out reforms, modernizing its armed forces and strengthening democracy.[193] Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who took office in 2018, has conceded that NATO membership might not be possible while Russia occupies Georgian territory, and has sought to focus on European Union membership,[194] which Georgia submitted its application for in May 2022.[195]\n\n\n\n### Ukraine[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ukraine–NATO relations\n\n![Two men in suits sit talking around a low wooden table.](image)As president, Viktor Yanukovych pursued closer relations with Russia.\nUkraine's present and future relationship with NATO has been politically divisive, and is part of a larger debate over Ukraine's political and cultural ties to both the European Union and Russia. Ukraine established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan in November 2002,[129][196] joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in February 2005,[197] then entered into the Intensified Dialogue program with NATO in April 2005.[198]\n\n\nThe position of Russian leaders on Ukraine-NATO relations has changed over time. In 2002, Russia's president Vladimir Putin declared no objections to Ukraine's growing relations with NATO and said it was a matter for Ukraine and NATO.[199] From 2008, Russia began stating its opposition to Ukraine's membership. That March, Ukraine applied for a Membership Action Plan (MAP), the first step in joining NATO. At the April 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared that Ukraine and Georgia would someday join NATO, but neither would begin Membership Action Plans.[200] At this summit, Putin called Ukrainian membership \"a direct threat\".[201]\n\n\nWhen Viktor Yanukovych became Ukraine's president in 2010, he said that Ukraine would remain a \"European, non-aligned state\",[202][203] and would remain a member of NATO's outreach program.[204] In June 2010 the Ukrainian parliament voted to drop the goal of NATO membership in a bill drafted by Yanukovych.[205] The bill forbade Ukraine's membership in any military bloc, but allowed for co-operation with alliances such as NATO.[206]\n\n\n\n![Dozens of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags are held aloft in a wide crowd.](image)The Euromaidan protests that ousted Viktor Yanukovych from presidential office attracted large numbers of Ukrainians in support of better ties with European countries.\nThe February 2014 Ukrainian Revolution brought another change in direction. Following months of protests that began because of his refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the EU in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled to Russia, and Ukraine's parliament voted to remove him from his post. This was followed by pro-Russian unrest in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea was annexed by Russia. In March 2014, new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership.[207]\n\n\nHowever, because of Russian military intervention in Ukraine,[208] Yatsenyuk announced the resumption of the NATO membership bid,[209] and in December 2014, Ukraine's parliament voted to drop non-aligned status.[210] NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said membership was still an option,[211] and support for membership rose to 64 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll.[212] Polls had shown that the rise in support for membership was linked to Russia's ongoing military intervention.[213]\n\n\n\n![Two men in business suits stand at silver podiums, with a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag to their left and a blue and white NATO flags to their right.](image)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in 2019.\nIn June 2017, Ukraine's parliament passed a law making NATO integration a foreign policy priority,[214] and President Petro Poroshenko announced he would negotiate a Membership Action Plan.[215] Ukraine was acknowledged as an aspiring member by March 2018.[216] In September 2018, Ukraine's parliament approved amendments to the constitution, making NATO membership the main foreign policy goal.[217]\n\n\nDuring 2021, there were massive Russian military build-ups near Ukraine's borders. In April 2021, Zelenskyy said that NATO membership \"is the only way to end the war in Donbas\" and that a MAP \"will be a real signal for Russia\".[218] Putin demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining NATO. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that Ukraine's relationship with NATO are a matter for Ukraine and NATO, adding that \"Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors\".[219]\n\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In his speech announcing the invasion, Putin falsely claimed that NATO military infrastructure was being built up inside Ukraine, threatening Russia.[220] Russia's invasion drove Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership. In June 2022, Putin said their membership wasn't a problem for Russia, but Ukraine's membership is a \"completely different thing\" because of \"territorial disputes\".[221] However, after eight years of Russia denying any involvement in war in Donbas and denying any \"territorial disputes\" with Ukraine, this position has been interpreted as nothing but a pretext: Peter Dickinson from Atlantic Council wrote Putin dislike of NATO is likely genuine but not perceived as an actual threat to Russia. Instead, \"Putin objects to NATO because it prevents him from bullying Russia’s neighbours\".[94]\n\n\nSince the invasion, calls for Ukrainian NATO membership have grown.[222] On 30 September 2022, Ukraine submitted an application for NATO membership.[132] According to *Politico*, NATO members are reluctant to discuss Ukraine's entry because of Putin's \"hypersensitivity\" on the issue.[223] At NATO's 2023 Vilnius summit it was decided that Ukraine would no longer be required to participate in a Membership Action Plan before joining the alliance.[131]\n\n\n\n## Membership debates[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Foreign relations of NATO\n\nThe Soviet Union was the primary ideological adversary for NATO during the Cold War. Following its dissolution, several states which had maintained neutrality during the Cold War or were post-Soviet states increased their ties with Western institutions; a number of them requested to join NATO. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reignited debate surrounding NATO membership in several countries.\n\n\nAustria, Ireland, Switzerland, and Malta have maintained their Cold War–era neutrality. All are now members of the Partnership for Peace, and all except Switzerland are now members of the European Union.[224] The defence ministry of Switzerland, which has a long-standing policy of neutrality, initiated a report in May 2022 analyzing various military options, including increased cooperation and joint military exercises with NATO. That month, a poll indicated 33% of Swiss supported NATO membership for Switzerland, and 56% supported increased ties with NATO.[225] Cyprus is also a member state of the European Union, but it is the only one that is neither a full member state nor participates in the Partnership for Peace. Any treaty concerning Cyprus' participation in NATO would likely be blocked by Turkey because of the Cyprus dispute.[226]\n\n\nRussia, Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are all members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a post-Soviet alternative military alliance. Azerbaijan was a member of the CSTO but has committed to a policy of neutrality since 1999.[227] In 2000, Russian President Vladimir Putin floated the idea of Russia potentially joining NATO.[228] However these prospects went nowhere and he began developing anti-NATO sentiment and espouses hostile views towards NATO today.[229] In 2009, Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin did not rule out joining NATO at some point, but stated that Russia was currently more interested in leading a coalition as a great power.[230]\n\n\n\n### Austria[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Austria–NATO relations\n\n![Four soldiers in green military attire walk in a line in front of a green military vehicle holding guns.](image)Austria's neutrality is enshrined in law and treaty, but it participates in peacekeeping missions like Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAustria was occupied by the four victorious Allied powers following World War II under the Allied Control Council, similar to Germany. During negotiations to end of the occupation, which were ongoing at the same time as Germany's, the Soviet Union insisted that the reunified country adopt the model of Swiss neutrality. The US feared that this would encourage West Germany to accept similar Soviet proposals for neutrality as a condition for German reunification.[231] Shortly after West Germany's accession to NATO, the parties agreed to the Austrian State Treaty in May 1955, which was largely based on the Moscow Memorandum signed the previous month between Austria and the Soviet Union. While the treaty itself did not commit Austria to neutrality, this was subsequently enshrined into Austria's constitution that October with the Declaration of Neutrality. The Declaration prohibits Austria from joining a military alliance, from hosting foreign military bases within its borders, and from participating in a war.[232]\n\n\nMembership of Austria in the European Union (or its predecessor organizations) was controversial because of the Austrian commitment to neutrality. Austria only joined in 1995, together with two Nordic countries that had also declared their neutrality in the Cold War (Sweden and Finland). Austria joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1995, and participates in NATO's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The Austrian military also participates in the United Nations peacekeeping operations and has deployments in several countries as of 2022[update], including Kosovo, Lebanon, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it has led the EUFOR mission there since 2009.[232] Several politicians from the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), including Andreas Khol, the 2016 presidential nominee, have argued in favor of NATO membership for Austria in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine,[233] and Chancellor from 2000 to 2007, Wolfgang Schüssel and his defense minister, Werner Fasslabend, both of the ÖVP, supported NATO membership as part of European integration during their tenure.[234] Current Chancellor Karl Nehammer, however, has rejected the idea of reopening Austria's neutrality and membership is not widely popular with the Austrian public.[235] According to a survey in May 2022 by the Austria Press Agency, only 14% of Austrians surveyed supported joining NATO, while 75% were opposed.[236]\n\n\n\n### Cyprus[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cyprus–NATO relations\n\nPrior to gaining its independence in 1960, Cyprus was a crown colony of the United Kingdom and as such the UK's NATO membership also applied to British Cyprus. The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus remained under British control as a British Overseas Territory following independence.[237] Neighbouring Greece and Turkey competed for influence in the newly independent Cyprus, with intercommunal rivalries and movements for union with Greece or partition and partial union with Turkey. The first President of the independent Republic of Cyprus (1960–1977), Archbishop of Cyprus Makarios III, adopted a policy of non-alignment and took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade.\n\n\nThe 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and ongoing dispute, in which Turkey continues to occupy Northern Cyprus, complicates Cyprus' relations with NATO. Any treaty concerning Cyprus' participation in NATO, either as a full member, PfP or Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, would likely be vetoed by Turkey, a full member of NATO, until the dispute is resolved.[226] NATO membership for a reunified Cyprus has been proposed as a solution to the question of security guarantees, given that all three of the current guarantors under the Treaty of Guarantee (1960) (Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom) are already NATO members.[238]\n\n\nThe Parliament of Cyprus voted in February 2011 to apply for membership in the PfP program, but President Demetris Christofias vetoed the decision as it would hamper his attempts to negotiate an end to the Cyprus dispute and demilitarize the island.[239][240] The winner of Cyprus' presidential election in February 2013, Nicos Anastasiades, stated that he intended to apply for membership in the PfP program soon after taking over.[241] His foreign minister and successor Nicos Christodoulides dismissed Cypriot membership of NATO or Partnership for Peace, preferring to keep Cyprus' foreign and defence affairs within the framework of the European Union.[242] In May 2022, Cyprus Defence Minister, Charalambos Petrides, confirmed that the country would not apply to NATO despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[243]\n\n\n\n### Ireland[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ireland–NATO relations\n\n![Male and female soldiers wearing camouflage marching behind the Irish tri-color flag.](image)Ireland currently does not seek to join NATO, but does work to improve the Defence Forces' interoperability with NATO.[244]\nIreland was neutral during World War II, though the country cooperated with Allied intelligence and permitted the Allies use of Irish airways and ports. Ireland continued its policy of military neutrality during the Cold War, and after it ended, joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) in 1999.[245] Ireland participates in the alliance's PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which aims to increase the interoperability of the Irish military, the Defence Forces, with NATO member states and bring them into line with accepted international standards so as to successfully deploy with other professional military forces on peacekeeping operations overseas.[246] Ireland supplied a small number of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan (2001–2014) and supports the ongoing NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).[247][248] Former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during a visit to the country in 2013 that the \"door is open\" for Ireland to join NATO at any time.[249]\n\n\nThere are a number of politicians who do support Ireland joining NATO, mainly within the center-right Fine Gael party, but the majority of politicians still do not.[250][251] The republican party Sinn Féin proposed a constitutional amendment to prohibit the country from joining a military alliance like NATO, but the legislation failed to pass the Dáil Éireann in April 2019.[252][253] While Taoiseach Micheál Martin said in 2022 that Ireland would not need to hold a referendum in order to join NATO, Irish constitutional lawyers have pointed to the precedent set by the 1987 case *Crotty v. An Taoiseach* as suggesting it would be necessary, and that any attempt to join NATO without a referendum would likely be legally challenged in the country's courts in a similar way.[254] Currently no major political party in Ireland fully supports accession to NATO, a reflection on public and media opinion in the country.[255] A poll in early March 2022 found 37% in favor of joining NATO and 52% opposed,[256] while one at the end of March 2022, found a sharp rise of approval with 48% supporting NATO membership and 39% opposing it.[257] An August 2022 poll found 52% in favor of joining and 48% opposed,[258] while a June 2023 poll found 34% in favour and 38% opposed.[259]\n\n\n\n### Kosovo[edit]\n\n\n![Three men and one woman in suits stand on a red carpet in front of two blue flags.](image)Kosovo President Hashim Thaçi meeting with US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison at NATO Headquarters in 2017\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008.[260] Kosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012,[261] and Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022.[262] In December 2018, Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj stated that Kosovo will apply for NATO membership after the formation of the Kosovo Armed Forces.[263] Kosovo's lack of recognition by four NATO member states—Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia—could impede its accession.[264][261] United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.[265]\n\n\nIn February 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Minister of Defense Armend Mehaj requested a permanent US military base in the country and an accelerated accession process to the organization, citing an \"immediate need to guarantee peace, security and stability in the Western Balkans\".[5] On 3 March 2022, a resolution was passed by Kosovo's Parliament requesting that the government \"take all necessary steps to join NATO, European Union, Council of Europe and other international organizations\".[266]\n\n\n\n### Malta[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malta–NATO relations\n\n![A sea-side cliff topped by a small white, spherical structure.](image)During the Cold War, NATO used radar facilities in Malta, which, like other non-NATO member European states, has generally cooperative relations with the organization.[267]\nWhen the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, one of the treaty's original signatories. As such, the Crown Colony of Malta shared the UK's international memberships, including NATO. Between 1952 and 1965, the headquarters of the Allied Forces Mediterranean was based in the town of Floriana, just outside Malta's capital of Valletta. When Malta gained independence in 1964, prime minister George Borg Olivier wanted the country to join NATO. Olivier was concerned that the presence of the NATO headquarters in Malta, without the security guarantees that NATO membership entailed, made the country a potential target. However, according to a memorandum he prepared at the time he was discouraged from formally submitting a membership application by Deputy Secretary General of NATO James A. Roberts. It was believed that some NATO members, including the United Kingdom, were opposed to Maltese NATO membership. As a result Olivier considered alternatives, such as seeking associate membership or unilateral security guarantees from NATO, or closing the NATO headquarters in Malta in retaliation.[268][269][270] Ultimately, Olivier supported the alliance and signed a defense agreement with the UK for use of Maltese military facilities in exchange for around £2 million a year.[271][272]\n\n\nThis friendly policy changed in 1971, when Dom Mintoff, of the Labour Party, was elected as prime minister. Mintoff supported neutrality as his foreign policy,[273] and the position was later enshrined into the country's constitution in 1974 as an amendment to Article 1.[274] The country joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1979, at the same time when the British Royal Navy left its base at the Malta Dockyard. In 1995, under Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami of the Nationalist Party, Malta joined the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council multilateral defense forum and NATO's Partnership for Peace program. When the Labour Party regained power the following year, however, it withdrew Malta from both organizations. Though the Nationalists resumed the majority in parliament in 1998, Malta didn't rejoin the EAPC and PfP programs again until 2008, after the country had joined the European Union in 2004. Since re-joining, Malta has been building its relations with NATO and getting involved in wider projects including the PfP Planning and Review Process and the NATO Science for Peace and Security Program.[275][276]\n\n\nNATO membership is not supported by any of the country's political parties, including neither the governing Labour Party nor the opposition Nationalist Party. NATO's secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has stated that the alliance fully respects Malta's position of neutrality, and put no pressure for the country to join the alliance.[275] Polling done by the island-nation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs found in February 2022 that 63% of those surveyed supported the island's neutrality, and only 6% opposed the policy, with 14% undecided.[277] A Eurobarometer survey in May 2022 found that 75% of Maltese would however support greater military cooperation within the European Union.[278]\n\n\n\n### Moldova[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Moldova–NATO relations\n\n![Two older European men in suits and ties stand in front of flags.](image)Former Defense Minister Anatol Șalaru (left) attending a NATO meeting in Warsaw in 2016\nMoldova gained independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country's current constitution was adopted in 1994, and forbids the country from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as former Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO as part of a larger European integration. Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010.[279] Moldova also participates in NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo.[280] Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region.[281] This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.[279]\n\n\nThe current Prime Minister of Moldova, Dorin Recean, supports European Union membership, but not NATO membership.[282] Moldova's President Maia Sandu stated in January 2023 that there was \"serious discussion\" about joining \"a larger alliance\", though she didn't specifically name NATO.[280] The second largest alliance in the parliament of Moldova, the Electoral Bloc of Communists and Socialists, strongly opposes NATO membership.[283] A poll in December 2018 found that, if given the choice in a referendum, 22% of Moldovans would vote in favor of joining NATO, while 32% would vote against it and 21% would be unsure.[284] Some Moldova politicians, including former Prime Minister Iurie Leancă, have also supported the idea of unifying with neighboring Romania, which Moldova shares a language and much of its history with, and a poll in April 2021 found that 43.9% of those surveyed supported that idea. Romania is a current member of both NATO and the European Union.[285]\n\n\n\n### Serbia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Serbia–NATO relations\n\n![A sidewalk with the words \"SERBIA YES NATO NO YANKEE GO HOME!\" spray painted in red.](image)Anti-NATO graffiti on a bridge in Novi Sad\nYugoslavia's communist government sided with the Eastern Bloc at the beginning of the Cold War, but pursued a policy of neutrality following the Tito–Stalin split in 1948.[286] It was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Since that country's dissolution most of its successor states have joined NATO, but the largest of them, Serbia, has maintained Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality.\n\n\nThe NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 against Bosnia-Serbian forces and the NATO bombing of targets in Serbia (then part of FR Yugoslavia) during the Kosovo War in 1999 resulted in strained relations between Serbia and NATO.[287] After the overthrow of President Slobodan Milošević Serbia wanted to improve its relations with NATO, though membership in the military alliance remained highly controversial among political parties and society.[288][289] In the years under Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić the country (then Serbia and Montenegro) did not rule out joining NATO, but after Đinđić's assassination in 2003 Serbia increasingly started preferring a course of military neutrality.[290][291] Serbia's Parliament passed a resolution in 2007 which declared Serbia's military neutrality until such time as a referendum could be held on the issue.[292] Relations with NATO were further strained following Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008, while it was a protectorate of the United Nations with security support from NATO.\n\n\nSerbia was invited to and joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program during the 2006 Riga summit, and in 2008 was invited to enter the intensified dialog program whenever the country was ready.[115] On 1 October 2008, Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Šutanovac signed the Information Exchange Agreement with NATO, one of the prerequisites for fuller membership in the Partnership for Peace program.[293] In April 2011 Serbia's request for an IPAP was approved by NATO,[294] and Serbia submitted a draft IPAP in May 2013.[295] The agreement was finalized on 15 January 2015.[296] Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, in office since 2017, reiterated in March 2022 that his government was not interested in NATO membership.[297] A poll that month suggested that 82% of Serbians opposed joining NATO, while only 10% supported the idea.[298] The minor Serbian Renewal Movement, which has two seats in the National Assembly, and the Liberal Democratic Party, which currently has none, remain the most vocal political parties in favor of NATO membership.[299] The Democratic Party abandoned its pro-NATO attitude, claiming the Partnership for Peace is enough.\n\n\nSerbia maintains close relations with Russia, which are due to their shared Slavic and Eastern Orthodox culture and their stances on the Kosovo issue. Serbia and Belarus are the only European states that refused to impose sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.[300][301][302]\n\n\n\n## Other proposals[edit]\n\n\nSome individuals have proposed expanding NATO outside of Europe, although doing so would require amending Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which specifically limits new membership to \"any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\"[303]\n\n\nChristopher Sands of the Hudson Institute proposed Mexican membership of NATO in order to enhance NATO cooperation with Mexico and develop a \"North American pillar\" for regional security,[304] while Christopher Skaluba and Gabriela Doyle of the Atlantic Council promoted the idea as way to support democracy in Latin America.[305] In June 2013, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated his hope that Colombia's cooperation with NATO could result in NATO membership, though his Foreign Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzon, quickly clarified that Colombia is not actively seeking NATO membership.[306] In June 2018, Qatar expressed its wish to join NATO,[307] but its application was rejected by NATO.[308] In March 2019, US President Donald Trump made Brazil a major non-NATO ally, and expressed support for the eventual accession of Brazil into NATO.[309] France's Foreign Ministry responded to this by reiterating the limitations of Article 10 on new membership, and suggested that Brazil could instead seek to become a Global Partner of NATO, like Colombia.[310]\n\n\nSeveral other current NATO Global Partners have been proposed as candidates for full membership. In 2006, Ivo Daalder, later the US Ambassador to NATO, proposed a \"global NATO\" that would incorporate democratic states from around the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, who all signed on as Global Partners in the 2010s, as well as Brazil, South Africa, and India.[303] In 2007, then-US presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani suggested including Singapore and Israel, among others.[311] In 2020, Trump stated that Middle Eastern countries should be admitted to NATO.[312] Because of its close ties to Europe, Cape Verde has been suggested as a future member and the government of Cape Verde suggested an interest in joining as recently as 2019.[313][314]\n\n\nInternal enlargement is the process of new member states arising from the break-up of or secession from an existing member state. There have been and are a number of active separatist movements within member states. After a long history of opposition to NATO, the separatist Scottish National Party agreed at its conference in 2012 that it wished for Scotland to retain its NATO membership were it to become independent from the United Kingdom.[315] In 2014, in the run up to the self-determination referendum, the Generalitat de Catalunya published a memo suggesting an independent Catalonia would want to keep all of Spain's current foreign relationships, including NATO, though other nations, namely Belgium, have questioned whether quick membership for breakaway regions could encourage secessionist movements elsewhere.[316]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* NATO open door policy\n* Enlargement of the European Union\n* Withdrawal from NATO\n* Partnership for Peace\n* Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council\n* Major non-NATO ally\n* List of countries in Europe by military expenditures\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Harding, Luke; Koshiw, Isobel (30 September 2022). \"Ukraine applies for Nato membership after Russia annexes territory\". *The Guardian*.

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include – being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central – someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n\n\n![](image)The underlying principles behind the Human Development Index.[5]\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and calculation[edit]\n\n\n### New method (2010 HDI onwards)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1990 and 2021 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| World\n OECD countries\n |  Developing countries: Arab States\n East Asia and the Pacific\n Europe and Central Asia\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nPublished on 4 November 2010 (and updated on 10 June 2011), the 2010 Human Development Report calculated the HDI combining three dimensions:[7][8]\n\n\n\n* A long and healthy life: Life expectancy at birth\n* Education: Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling\n* A decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP international dollars)\n\n\nIn its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI. The following three indices are used:\n\n\n1.

last used in its 2009 report:\n\n\n\n* Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI\n* Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).\n* Standard of living, as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity.\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1975 and 2004 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| OECD\n Europe (not in the OECD), and CIS\n Latin America and the

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[12] In general, to transform a raw variable, say \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), into a unit-free index between 0 and 1 (which allows different indices to be added together), the following formula is used:\n\n\n\n* x\n\n index\n\n=\n\n\n\nx\n−\na\n\n\nb\n−\na\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x{\\text{ index}}={\\frac

They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[17]\n\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to *The Economist* in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded[18] to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine[19] which discusses the Wolff *et al.* paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff *et al.* in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\n\nIn 2013, Salvatore Monni and Alessandro Spaventa emphasized that in the debate of GDP versus HDI, it is often forgotten that these are both external indicators that prioritize different benchmarks upon which the quantification of societal welfare can be predicated. The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### Indices[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Modern history portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Gross National Happiness\n* Broad measures of economic progress\n* Corruption Perceptions Index\n* Democracy indices\n* Fragile States Index\n* Gender Inequality Index\n* Gender Development Index\n* Genuine progress indicator (GPI)\n* Global Peace Index (GPI)\n* Green gross domestic product (Green GDP)\n* Green national product\n* Gross domestic product\n* Gross National Well-being (GNW)\n* Happy Planet Index (HPI)\n* Human Poverty Index\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)\n* Legatum Prosperity Index\n* List of countries by Human Development Index\n* Living Planet Index\n* Multidimensional Poverty Index\n* OECD Better Life Index (BLI)\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI)\n* World Press Freedom Index\n* Rule of Law Index\n* Social Progress Index\n* Where-to-be-born Index\n* World Happiness Report\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n* Developing country\n* Economic development\n* Ethics of care\n* Happiness economics\n* Human Development and Capability Association\n* Humanistic economics\n* International development\n* List of sovereign states by percentage of population living in poverty\n* List of countries by share of income of the richest one percent\n* Right to an adequate standard of living\n* Life satisfaction\n* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A.

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\nThe HDI is the most widely used indicator of human development and has changed how people view the concept.[3][4] However, several aspects of the index have received criticism. Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\nTo reflect developmental differences within countries, a subnational HDI (SHDI) featuring data for more than 1,600 regions was introduced in 2018 by the Global Data Lab at Radboud University in the Netherlands.[10] In 2020, the UNDP introduced another index, the planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), which decreases the scores of countries with a higher ecological footprint.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and indicators[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![World map](image)Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 published in 2022* ≥ 1.4%\n* 1.2%…1.4%\n* 1%…1.2%\n* 0.8%…1%\n* 0.6%…0.8%\n* 0.4%…0.6%\n* 0.2%…0.4%\n* 0%…0.2%\n* −0.5%…0%\n* −1%…−0.5%\n* < −1%\n* No data\n\nThe Human Development Report includes all 193[16] United Nations member states, as well as Palestine and Hong Kong SAR. However, the Human Development Index is not calculated for four of the UN member states: DPR Korea (North Korea), Monaco, Nauru, and Somalia. Some components of the index may be calculated for these countries. The Holy See (Vatican City), the Cook Islands, and Niue are the only state parties within the United Nations System that are not included in the report.[17] In total, the HDI is available for 191 nations.[2]\n\n\nGlobal Data Lab also provides data on the HDI of Somalia, putting it at 0.361 (2019), the lowest in the world.[18]\n\n\nCountries ranked from 1 to 66 in 2021 are designated \"very high\" HDI; those ranked from 67 to 115 are designated \"high\" HDI; those ranked from 116 to 159 are denoted \"medium\" HDI; and those ranked from 160 to 191 are designated \"low\" HDI.[19][13]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of countries by HDI\n| Rank\n | Nation\n | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Change since 2015​[20] | 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Average

groups of countries. These include regional groupings based on the UNDP regional classifications,[21] HDI groups including the countries currently falling into a given HDI bracket, OECD members and various other UN groupings.[22] The aggregate HDI values are calculated in the same way as for individual countries with the input data being the weighted average for all countries with available data in the group.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of regions and groups by HDI[24]\n| Region or group | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2015 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OECD | 0.795 | 0.840 | 0.875 | 0.893 | 0.901 | 0.905 | 0.897 | 0.899\n |\n| *Very high human development* | 0.784 | 0.826 | 0.868 | 0.889 | 0.898 | 0.902 | 0.895 | 0.896\n |\n| Europe and Central Asia | 0.664 | 0.681 | 0.746 | 0.783 | 0.798 | 0.802 | 0.793 | 0.796\n |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 0.633 | 0.689 | 0.733 | 0.758 | 0.766 | 0.768 | 0.755 | 0.754\n |\n| *High human development* | 0.557 | 0.625 | 0.700 | 0.734 | 0.751 | 0.756 | 0.753 | 0.754\n |\n| East Asia and the Pacific | 0.507 | 0.592 | 0.684 | 0.722 | 0.741 | 0.748 | 0.748 | 0.749\n |\n| World\n | 0.601 | 0.645 | 0.697 | 0.724 | 0.736 | 0.739 | 0.735 | 0.732\n |\n| Small Island Developing States | 0.601 | 0.649 | 0.693 | 0.723 | 0.734 | 0.738 | 0.732 | 0.730\n |\n| Arab states | 0.555 | 0.618 | 0.676 | 0.697 | 0.711 | 0.715 | 0.708 | 0.708\n |\n| Developing countries | 0.513 | 0.569 | 0.638 | 0.673 | 0.687 | 0.691 | 0.687 | 0.685\n |\n| *Medium human development* | 0.453 | 0.506 | 0.582 | 0.627 | 0.643 | 0.645 | 0.642 | 0.636\n |\n| South Asia | 0.442 | 0.500 | 0.576 | 0.623 | 0.640 | 0.641 | 0.638 | 0.632\n |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | 0.407 | 0.430 | 0.503 | 0.534 | 0.547 | 0.552 | 0.549 | 0.547\n |\n| Least developed countries | 0.357 | 0.408 | 0.487 | 0.520 | 0.537 | 0.542 | 0.542 | 0.540\n |\n| *Low human development* | 0.356 | 0.399 | 0.477 | 0.506 | 0.518 | 0.522 | 0.519 | 0.518\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by Human Development Index by region\n\t+ Africa\n\t+ Asia and Oceania\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ Latin America\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index (HDI) | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\nThe HDI is the most widely used indicator of human development and has changed how people view the concept.[3][4] However, several aspects of the index have received criticism. Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\nTo reflect developmental differences within countries, a subnational HDI (SHDI) featuring data for more than 1,600 regions was introduced in 2018 by the Global Data Lab at Radboud University in the Netherlands.[10] In 2020, the UNDP introduced another index, the planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), which decreases the scores of countries with a higher ecological footprint.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and indicators[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![World map](image)Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 published in 2022* ≥ 1.4%\n* 1.2%…1.4%\n* 1%…1.2%\n* 0.8%…1%\n* 0.6%…0.8%\n* 0.4%…0.6%\n* 0.2%…0.4%\n* 0%…0.2%\n* −0.5%…0%\n* −1%…−0.5%\n* < −1%\n* No data\n\nThe Human Development Report includes all 193[16] United Nations member states, as well as Palestine and Hong Kong SAR. However, the Human Development Index is not calculated for four of the UN member states: DPR Korea (North Korea), Monaco, Nauru, and Somalia. Some components of the index may be calculated for these countries. The Holy See (Vatican City), the Cook Islands, and Niue are the only state parties within the United Nations System that are not included in the report.[17] In total, the HDI is available for 191 nations.[2]\n\n\nGlobal Data Lab also provides data on the HDI of Somalia, putting it at 0.361 (2019), the lowest in the world.[18]\n\n\nCountries ranked from 1 to 66 in 2021 are designated \"very high\" HDI; those ranked from 67 to 115 are designated \"high\" HDI; those ranked from 116 to 159 are denoted \"medium\" HDI; and those ranked from 160 to 191 are designated \"low\" HDI.[19][13]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of countries by HDI\n| Rank\n | Nation\n | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Change since 2015​[20] | 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Average

groups of countries. These include regional groupings based on the UNDP regional classifications,[21] HDI groups including the countries currently falling into a given HDI bracket, OECD members and various other UN groupings.[22] The aggregate HDI values are calculated in the same way as for individual countries with the input data being the weighted average for all countries with available data in the group.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of regions and groups by HDI[24]\n| Region or group | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2015 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OECD | 0.795 | 0.840 | 0.875 | 0.893 | 0.901 | 0.905 | 0.897 | 0.899\n |\n| *Very high human development* | 0.784 | 0.826 | 0.868 | 0.889 | 0.898 | 0.902 | 0.895 | 0.896\n |\n| Europe and Central Asia | 0.664 | 0.681 | 0.746 | 0.783 | 0.798 | 0.802 | 0.793 | 0.796\n |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 0.633 | 0.689 | 0.733 | 0.758 | 0.766 | 0.768 | 0.755 | 0.754\n |\n| *High human development* | 0.557 | 0.625 | 0.700 | 0.734 | 0.751 | 0.756 | 0.753 | 0.754\n |\n| East Asia and the Pacific | 0.507 | 0.592 | 0.684 | 0.722 | 0.741 | 0.748 | 0.748 | 0.749\n |\n| World\n | 0.601 | 0.645 | 0.697 | 0.724 | 0.736 | 0.739 | 0.735 | 0.732\n |\n| Small Island Developing States | 0.601 | 0.649 | 0.693 | 0.723 | 0.734 | 0.738 | 0.732 | 0.730\n |\n| Arab states | 0.555 | 0.618 | 0.676 | 0.697 | 0.711 | 0.715 | 0.708 | 0.708\n |\n| Developing countries | 0.513 | 0.569 | 0.638 | 0.673 | 0.687 | 0.691 | 0.687 | 0.685\n |\n| *Medium human development* | 0.453 | 0.506 | 0.582 | 0.627 | 0.643 | 0.645 | 0.642 | 0.636\n |\n| South Asia | 0.442 | 0.500 | 0.576 | 0.623 | 0.640 | 0.641 | 0.638 | 0.632\n |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | 0.407 | 0.430 | 0.503 | 0.534 | 0.547 | 0.552 | 0.549 | 0.547\n |\n| Least developed countries | 0.357 | 0.408 | 0.487 | 0.520 | 0.537 | 0.542 | 0.542 | 0.540\n |\n| *Low human development* | 0.356 | 0.399 | 0.477 | 0.506 | 0.518 | 0.522 | 0.519 | 0.518\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by Human Development Index by region\n\t+ Africa\n\t+ Asia and Oceania\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ Latin America\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index (HDI) | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\nThe HDI is the most widely used indicator of human development and has changed how people view the concept.[3][4] However, several aspects of the index have received criticism. Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\nTo reflect developmental differences within countries, a subnational HDI (SHDI) featuring data for more than 1,600 regions was introduced in 2018 by the Global Data Lab at Radboud University in the Netherlands.[10] In 2020, the UNDP introduced another index, the planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), which decreases the scores of countries with a higher ecological footprint.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and indicators[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![World map](image)Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 published in 2022* ≥ 1.4%\n* 1.2%…1.4%\n* 1%…1.2%\n* 0.8%…1%\n* 0.6%…0.8%\n* 0.4%…0.6%\n* 0.2%…0.4%\n* 0%…0.2%\n* −0.5%…0%\n* −1%…−0.5%\n* < −1%\n* No data\n\nThe Human Development Report includes all 193[16] United Nations member states, as well as Palestine and Hong Kong SAR. However, the Human Development Index is not calculated for four of the UN member states: DPR Korea (North Korea), Monaco, Nauru, and Somalia. Some components of the index may be calculated for these countries. The Holy See (Vatican City), the Cook Islands, and Niue are the only state parties within the United Nations System that are not included in the report.[17] In total, the HDI is available for 191 nations.[2]\n\n\nGlobal Data Lab also provides data on the HDI of Somalia, putting it at 0.361 (2019), the lowest in the world.[18]\n\n\nCountries ranked from 1 to 66 in 2021 are designated \"very high\" HDI; those ranked from 67 to 115 are designated \"high\" HDI; those ranked from 116 to 159 are denoted \"medium\" HDI; and those ranked from 160 to 191 are designated \"low\" HDI.[19][13]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of countries by HDI\n| Rank\n | Nation\n | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Change since 2015​[20] | 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Average

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include – being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central – someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n\n\n![](image)The underlying principles behind the Human Development Index.[5]\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and calculation[edit]\n\n\n### New method (2010 HDI onwards)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1990 and 2021 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| World\n OECD countries\n |  Developing countries: Arab States\n East Asia and the Pacific\n Europe and Central Asia\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nPublished on 4 November 2010 (and updated on 10 June 2011), the 2010 Human Development Report calculated the HDI combining three dimensions:[7][8]\n\n\n\n* A long and healthy life: Life expectancy at birth\n* Education: Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling\n* A decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP international dollars)\n\n\nIn its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI. The following three indices are used:\n\n\n1. Life Expectancy Index (LEI) \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n\n\n−\n20\n\n\n85\n−\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{85-20}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{85-20}}}](image)\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n\n\n−\n20\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{65}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{65}}}](image)\n\n\n\nLEI is equal to 1 when life expectancy at birth is 85 years, and 0 when life expectancy at birth is 20 years.\n2.

$100.\nFinally, the HDI is the geometric mean of the previous three normalized

incl. young men and women aged 13–17)  \n\nGNIpc: Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Old method (HDI before 2010)[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 report:\n\n\n\n* Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI\n* Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).\n* Standard of living, as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity.\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1975 and 2004 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| OECD\n Europe (not in the OECD), and CIS\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n East Asia\n | Arab League\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nThis methodology was used by the UNDP until their 2011 report.\n\n\nThe formula defining the HDI is promulgated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[12] In general, to transform a raw variable, say \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), into a unit-free index between 0 and 1 (which allows different indices to be added together), the following formula is used:\n\n\n\n* x\n\n index\n\n=\n\n\n\nx\n−\na\n\n\nb\n−\na\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x{\\text{ index}}={\\frac

b}\n\n![{\\displaystyle b}](image) are the lowest and highest values the variable \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image) can attain, respectively.\n\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) then represents the uniformly weighted sum with 1⁄3 contributed by each of the following factor indices:\n\n\n\n* Life Expectancy Index

They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[17]\n\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to *The Economist* in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded[18] to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine[19] which discusses the Wolff *et al.* paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff *et al.* in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\n\nIn 2013, Salvatore Monni and Alessandro Spaventa emphasized that in the debate of GDP versus HDI, it is often forgotten that these are both external indicators that prioritize different benchmarks upon which the quantification of societal welfare can be predicated. The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### Indices[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Modern history portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Gross National Happiness\n* Broad measures of economic progress\n* Corruption Perceptions Index\n* Democracy indices\n* Fragile States Index\n* Gender Inequality Index\n* Gender Development Index\n* Genuine progress indicator (GPI)\n* Global Peace Index (GPI)\n* Green gross domestic product (Green GDP)\n* Green national product\n* Gross domestic product\n* Gross National Well-being (GNW)\n* Happy Planet Index (HPI)\n* Human Poverty Index\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)\n* Legatum Prosperity Index\n* List of countries by Human Development Index\n* Living Planet Index\n* Multidimensional Poverty Index\n* OECD Better Life Index (BLI)\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI)\n* World Press Freedom Index\n* Rule of Law Index\n* Social Progress Index\n* Where-to-be-born Index\n* World Happiness Report\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n* Developing country\n* Economic development\n* Ethics of care\n* Happiness economics\n* Human Development and Capability Association\n* Humanistic economics\n* International development\n* List of sovereign states by percentage of population living in poverty\n* List of countries by share of income of the richest one percent\n* Right to an adequate standard of living\n* Life satisfaction\n* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A.

It covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory of 13,812 square kilometres (5,333 sq mi), and is home to roughly 31% of its total population of 621,000.[14] Cetinje (Cyrillic: Цетиње) is the former royal capital and cultural centre of Montenegro and is the location of several national institutions, including the official residence of the President of Montenegro.[15]\n\n\nDuring the Early Medieval period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and Rascia proper, the north.[16][17][18] The Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the late 14th century to the late 18th century, large parts of southern Montenegro were ruled by the Venetian Republic and incorporated into Venetian Albania.[19] The name *Montenegro* was first used to refer to the country in the late 15th century. After falling under Ottoman Empire rule, Montenegro gained semi-autonomy in 1696 under the rule of the House of Petrović-Njegoš, first as a theocracy and later as a secular principality. Montenegro's independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In 1910, the country became a kingdom. After World War I, the kingdom became part of Yugoslavia. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro together proclaimed a federation. In June 2006 Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia and Montenegro following an independence referendum, creating Montenegro and Serbia as they exist today.[20] Montenegro is therefore one of the newest internationally-recognised countries in the world.[21]\n\n\nMontenegro has an upper-middle-income economy,[22] and ranks 49th in the Human Development Index.[23] It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the Central European Free Trade Agreement.[24] Montenegro is also a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean,[25] and has been in the process of joining the European Union since 2012.[26]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe country's English name derives from a Venetian calque of the Serbian \"Crna Gora\", meaning literally \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of Mount Lovćen which was covered in dense evergreen forests.[27] *Crna Gora,* was mentioned for the first time in edicts issued by Stefan Uroš I to the Serbian Orthodox Zeta Episcopate seat at Vranjina island in Lake Skadar.[28] It came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.[29] \n\n![](image)Ruins of the ancient city of Doclea\nModern-day Montenegro was more and more known by that name in the historical period following the fall of the Serbian Despotate.[30] Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the Paštrovići tribe, but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the Crnojević noble family took power in Upper Zeta.[29] The aforementioned region became known as *Stara Crna Gora* 'Old Montenegro' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of *Brda* '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the Ottoman Empire, which saw the annexation of Old Herzegovina and parts of Metohija and southern Raška. Its borders have changed little since then, losing Metohija and gaining the Bay of Kotor.\n\n\nAfter the second session of the AVNOJ during World War II in Yugoslavia, the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the *Federal State of Montenegro* (Montenegrin: Савезна држава Црне Горе / *Savezna država Crne Gore*) on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the ZAVNOCGB. After the war, Montenegro became a republic under its name, the *People's Republic of Montenegro* (Montenegrin: Народна Република Црна Гора / *Narodna Republika Crna Gora*) on 29 November 1945. In 1963, it was renamed to the *Socialist Republic of Montenegro* (Montenegrin: Социјалистичка Република Црна Гора / *Socijalistička Republika Crna Gora*). As the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred, the SRCG was renamed to the *Republic of Montenegro* (Montenegrin: Република Црна Гора / *Republika Crna Gora*) on 27 April 1992 within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by removing the adjective \"socialist\" from the republic's title. Since 22 October 2007, a year after its independence, the name of the country became simply known as *Montenegro*. The country is known as *Mali i Zi* (lit. black mountain) in Albanian,[31] while it is known as Crna Gora in Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian as well as in Croatian.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Montenegro\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Illyria, Illyricum (Roman province), Dalmatia (Roman province), and Praevalitana\n\nModern-day Montenegro was part of Illyria and populated by the Indo-European-speaking Illyrians.[32][33] The Illyrian kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic in the Illyro-Roman Wars and the region was incorporated into the province of Illyricum (later Dalmatia and Praevalitana).[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n### Arrival of the Slavs[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Duklja, Principality of Zeta, and Tribes of Montenegro\n\n![](image)Constantine Bodin, medieval King and the ruler of Duklja\nThree principalities were located on the territory: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Raška, the north.[16][17] Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042. Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, Mihailo (1046–1081), and his grandson Constantine Bodin (1081–1101).[37]\n\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by Stefan Nemanja and was a part of various state formations ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty for the next two centuries. After the Serbian Empire collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the Balšićs, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\n\nBy the 13th century, *Zeta* had replaced *Duklja* when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as *Crna Gora*.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Left:** Petar I Petrović-Njegoš was the most popular spiritual and military leader from the Petrović dynasty.   \n**Right:** Petar II Petrović-Njegoš was a Prince-Bishop (*vladika*) of Montenegro and the national poet and philosopher. Oil painting of Njegoš as *vladika*, c. 1837\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the Serbian Despotate, but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the Crnojevićs, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the Ottomans in 1496, and got annexed to the *sanjak* of Shkodër. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous *sanjak* in 1514–1528 (Sanjak of Montenegro). Also, Old Herzegovina region was part of Sanjak of Herzegovina.\n\n\n\n### Early modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro and Venetian Albania\n\nFrom 1392, numerous parts of the territory were controlled by Republic of Venice, including the city of Budva, in that time known as \"Budua\". \nThe Venetian territory was centred on the Bay of Kotor, and the Republic introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. Venice controlled territories in present-day Montenegro until its fall in 1797.[19][38][39]\nLarge portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire that permitted Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, repeatedly rebelled, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War at the end of that century.\n\n\nMontenegrin territories were controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (*knez*), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. An assembly of Montenegrin clans (*Zbor*) was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.[40] In 1515, Montenegro became a theocracy led by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral, which flourished after the Petrović-Njegoš of Cetinje became the prince-bishop (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\").\n\n\nPeople from Montenegro in this historical period were described as Orthodox Serbs.[41]\n\n\n\n### Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Principality of Montenegro and Kingdom of Montenegro\n\n![](image)Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918 within present borders\nIn 1858, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the Battle of Grahovac. Grand Duke Mirko Petrović, elder brother of Knjaz Danilo, led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at Grahovac on 1 May 1858. This forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, *de facto* recognizing Montenegro's independence.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBattle of Vučji Do, 1876, major battle of the Montenegrin-Ottoman War\n![](image)\nRoyal family of Montenegro: King Nicholas I with his family including his grandson Alexander I. Karađorđević, future King of Serbia and Yugoslavia. The Petrović-Njegoš dynasty ruled Montenegro continuously for almost 200 years.\n\nIn the Battle of Vučji Do Montenegrins inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.\n\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855. Under Nicholas I (ruled 1860–1918), the principality was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire.[*citation needed*] Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of Abdul Hamid II in 1909.[42]\n\n\nThe political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations.[42] Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning People's Party, who supported the process of democratisation and union with Serbia, and those of the True People's Party, who were monarchist.\n\n\nIn 1910, Montenegro became a kingdom, and as a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, a common border with Serbia was established, with Shkodër being awarded to Albania, though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia. Montenegro became one of the Allied Powers during World War I (1914–18). In the Battle of Mojkovac fought in January 1916 between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Montenegro, Montenegrins achieved a decisive victory even though they were outnumbered five to one. The Austro-Hungarians accepted military surrender on 25 January 1916.[43] From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and established a government-in-exile in Bordeaux.\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kingdom of Yugoslavia\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the Oblast of Cetinje in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, with the addition of the coastal areas around Budva and Bay of Kotor. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger Zeta Banate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that reached the Neretva River.\n\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King Alexander I, dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas that formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n\n\n### World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Italian governorate of Montenegro and Socialist Republic of Montenegro\n\nIn April 1941, Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established a puppet Kingdom of Montenegro.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nCaptured ships of the Yugoslav Navy, Bay of Kotor 1941\n![](image)\nGreat People's Assembly on the occasion of the establishment of the Eighth Montenegrin Brigade in Berane, February 25, 1944.\n![](image)\nOpening of Belgrade–Bar railway. Construction of the line started in the 1950s and completed in 1976. The line was opened in 1976 by the Yugoslavian President Josip Broz Tito.\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for guerrilla warfare. According to some historians, the first armed uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.[44]\n\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nikšić), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included Arso Jovanović, Sava Kovačević, Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, Milovan Đilas, Peko Dapčević, Vlado Dapčević, Veljko Vlahović, and Blažo Jovanović. Those loyal to the Karađorđević dynasty and opposing communism went on to become Chetniks, and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to Mostar, where they fought in the Battle of Neretva against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\n\nDuring German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed many Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon occupied by German forces, and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed Titograd in honour of President Josip Broz Tito. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the University of Montenegro was established. Greater autonomy was established until the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ratified a new constitution in 1974.[45][46]\n\n\n\n### Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Serbia and Montenegro and Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)\n\nAfter the formal dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller Federal Republic of Yugoslavia along with Serbia. In the referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia. The referendum was boycotted by opposition parties such as the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro,[47] the Social Democratic and Socialist Parties,[48] as well as minority parties such as the Democratic League in Montenegro,[49] leading to a relatively low turnout of 66%.[47]\n\n\nDuring the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and Croatian War, Montenegrin police and military forces, under orders of president Momir Bulatovic[50] and Interior Minister Pavle Bulatovic[51] joined Serbian troops in attacks on Dubrovnik, Croatia.[52] These operations, aimed at acquiring more territory, were characterised by large-scale violations of human rights.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the disintegration of Yugoslavia until 2008.\nMontenegrin General Pavle Strugar was convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.[54] Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča, where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.[55]\n\n\nIn 1996, Milo Đukanović's government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia, which was led by Slobodan Milošević. Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the German Deutsche Mark as its currency and subsequently adopted the euro, although not part of the Eurozone. Subsequent governments pursued pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade.\n\n\nTargets in Montenegro were bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999, although the extent of these attacks was limited in both time and area affected.[56]\n\n\nIn 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement for continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This resulted in the Belgrade Agreement, which saw the country's transformation into a more decentralised state union named Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. The Belgrade Agreement also contained a provision delaying any future referendum on the independence of Montenegro for at least three years.\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Serbia and Montenegro and Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006\n\nSee also: 2016 Montenegrin coup d'état attempt allegations and 2019–20 Montenegrin crisis\n\n![](image)Supporters of Montenegrin independence in June 2006 in Cetinje.\nThe status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against.[57] This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council all recognised Montenegro's independence.\n\n\nThe 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an OSCE/ODIHR team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from CDT (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM—in its preliminary report—\"assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation.\" Furthermore, the report stated that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that \"there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights.\"\n\n\nOn 3 June 2006, the Montenegrin Parliament declared the independence of Montenegro,[58] formally confirming the result of the referendum.\n\n\n\n![](image)Montenegro Foreign Minister Srdjan Darmanović presents a document to US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon and Montenegro Prime Minister Duško Marković during a ceremony at the State Department to accept Montenegro's instrument of accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nOn 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the United Nations as its 192nd member state.[59]\n\n\nMontenegro has been dominated since the breakup of Yugoslavia by Milo Đukanović (four-time prime minister and also twice president), accused of having established an authoritarianism and clientelist regime, while maintaining close relations with organized crime.[60] The massive privatizations of the Đukanović era lead to the enrichment of him and oligarchs close to him. His brother Aleksandar, owner of Montenegro's first private bank, oversaw the privatizations, while his sister, Ana Kolarevic, has long controlled the judiciary. The clientelist networks of the ruling party dominated all segments of social life. A party card was required to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. This policy also contributed to the reinforcement of regional disparities and social inequalities. Unemployment climbs to 36.6 per cent in the northern part of the country, compared to 3.9 per cent in the coastal region, while a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line (2018).[61]\n\n\nThe Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011. It rehabilitated the Royal House of Montenegro and recognised limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic.\n\n\nIn 2015, the investigative journalists' network OCCRP named Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister Milo Đukanović \"Person of the Year in Organized Crime\".[62] The extent of Đukanović's corruption led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal.[63][64]\n\n\nIn October 2016, for the day of the parliamentary election, a coup d'état was prepared by a group of persons that included leaders of the Montenegrin opposition, Serbian nationals and Russian agents; the coup was prevented.[65] In 2017, fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, Andrija Mandić and Milan Knežević, were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as \"preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro\" and an \"attempted terrorist act.\"[66]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The controversial 2019 law on religious communities, introduced by the former ruling DPS, proposed the transfer of the majority of religious objects and land owned by the largest religious organization in the country, the SPC, to the Montenegrin state. It sparked a series of massive protests of the Serbian clerical right and pro-Serbian radical parties in Montenegro across the country, which led to the first government change in the country's history.\nMontenegro formally became a member of NATO in June 2017, despite attempts by Russia to sabotage it,[67] an event that triggered a promise of retaliatory actions from Russia's government.[68][69][70]\n\n\nMontenegro has been in negotiations with the EU since 2012. In 2018, the earlier goal of acceding by 2022[71] was revised to 2025.[72] Legislation is being passed bringing Montenegro law in line with EU membership requirements.\n\n\nIn April 2018, Milo Djukanovic, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), won Montenegro's presidential election. The veteran politician had served as Prime Minister six times and as president once before. He had dominated Montenegrin politics since 1991.[73]\n\n\nAnti-corruption protests began in February 2019 against Đukanović and the Prime Minister Duško Marković-led government of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), which had been in power since 1991.[74][75]\n\n\nAs of late December 2019,[update] the newly adopted Law on Religion, which de jure transferred the ownership of church buildings and estates built before 1918 from the Serbian Orthodox Church to the Montenegrin state,[76][77] sparked large[78] protests and road blockages.[79] Seventeen opposition Democratic Front MPs were arrested prior to the voting for disrupting the vote.[80] Demonstrations continued into March[81] 2020 as peaceful protest walks, mostly organised by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral and the Eparchy of Budimlja and Nikšić in the majority of Montenegrin municipalities.[82][83][84]\n\n\nIn its political rights and civil liberties worldwide report in May 2020, Freedom House marked Montenegro as a hybrid regime rather than a democracy because of declining standards in governance, justice, elections, and media freedom.[85][86] For the first time in three decades, in the 2020 parliamentary election, the opposition won more votes than Đukanović's ruling party.[87] In February 2022, that very same government was voted out in the first successful vote of no-confidence in the country's history.[88]\n\n\nIn September 2022 an investigation linked six Russian diplomats with twenty eight Russian citizens holding temporary visas for Montenegro and two local citizens in a spy investigation. The diplomats were expelled.[89] The Russian citizens were later banned from Montenegro and the two locals, one an ex-diplomat, face charges of illegal weapons, organising a criminal organisation and espionage.[90]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Jakov Milatovic, a pro-western candidate of the Europe Now movement, won the presidential election run-off over incumbent Milo Djukanovic to succeed him as the incumbent president of Montenegro.[91] The Europe Now movement won the highest number of seats in the 2023 Montenegrin parliamentary election.[92] [93] On 31 October 2023, Milojko Spajic of the Europe Now Movement became Montenegro's new prime minister, leading a coalition of both pro-European and pro-Serb parties.[94]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Montenegro\n\n![](image)Map of Montenegro.\n![](image)\nProkletije National Park\n![](image)\nLake Skadar National Park is a hotspot of freshwater biodiversity\n![](image)\nBiogradska Gora National Park\n\nMontenegro features high peaks along its borders with Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania, a segment of the Karst of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only 1.5 to 6 kilometres (1 to 4 miles) wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where Mount Lovćen and Mount Orjen plunge into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor.\n\n\nMontenegro's large karst region lies generally at elevations of 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) above sea level; some parts, however, rise to 2,000 m (6,560 ft), such as Mount Orjen (1,894 m or 6,214 ft), the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The Zeta River valley, at an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), is the lowest segment.\n\n\nThe mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrains in Europe, averaging more than 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation. One of the country's notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountains, which reaches a height of 2,522 m (8,274 ft). Owing to the hyperhumid climate on their western sides, the Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.\n\n\n\n![](image)The village of Mala Crna Gora and the Kanjon Sušice.\nInternationally, Montenegro borders Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania and Croatia.

The number of species per area unit index in Montenegro is 0.837, the highest in any European country.[95]\n\n\nBiological estimates suggest that over 1,200 species of freshwater algae, 300 species of marine algae, 589 species of moss, 7,000–8,000 species of vascular plants, 2,000 species of fungi, 16,000–20,000 species of insects, 407 species of marine fish, 56 species of reptile, 333 species of regularly visiting birds and a high species diversity of mammals are found in Montenegro.[96]\n\n\nMontenegro can be divided into two main biogeographic regions, which include the Mediterranean Biogeographic Region and the Alpine Biogeographic Region.[96] It is also home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Illyrian deciduous forests.[97] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.41/10, ranking it 73rd globally out of 172 countries.[98]\n\n\nThe total share of protected areas in Montenegro is 9.05% of the country's area, which mainly comes from the five national parks of Montenegro.[96]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Montenegro\n\n![Milo Đukanović](image)\nJakov Milatović  \nPresident (representative head of state)\nDritan Abazović\nDritan Abazović  \nPrime Minister (head of government)\n\nSince the breakup of the political union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2006, Montenegro has been an independent, sovereign state. \n\n\nMontenegro is a parliamentary representative democratic republic with a codified constitution established in 2007. The constitution describes Montenegro as a \"civic, democratic, ecological state of social justice, based on the reign of Law\".[99] Montenegro is a multi-party system. \n\n\nThe President of Montenegro is the representative head of state, elected for a period of five years through direct election. The President promotes the country internationally through diplomatic engagements, promulgates laws by ordinance, calls elections for the Parliament, and ceremonially proposes candidates for Prime Minister, president and justices of the Constitutional Court to the Parliament. The President also ceremonially proposes the calling of a referendum to Parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences prescribed by the national law, confers decoration and awards and performs other constitutional duties and is a member of the Supreme Defence Council. The official residence of the President is in Cetinje. The incumbent president is Jakov Milatović who has held the position since 2023.\n\n\nThe Government of Montenegro is the executive branch of government authority of Montenegro and led by the Prime Minister.[100] The role of Prime Minister is the most politically powerful office in Montenegro. All of Montenegro's governments since 2006 have been coalitions comprising a minimum of three political parties. The government is primarily based in Podgorica. \n\n\nThe Parliament of Montenegro is the country's unicameral legislature, located in Podgorica. The Parliament has power to appoint the government, pass legislation (parliamentary law) and scrutinise bills (proposed parliamentary law). It also appoints justices of all courts, approves the budget and performs other duties as established by the country's Constitution. Parliament can pass a motion of no confidence in the Government by simple majority vote. One member of the Montenegrin parliament, known as a Deputy, is elected per 6,000 voters.[101] There are currently 81 deputies. Elections to the Parliament are conducted by the D'Hondt method, a form of proportional representation.\n\n\nIn 2019, Montenegro was described as a hybrid regime (a political system which combines democractic and authoritarian features) according to the United States-based Freedom House. The organisation cited state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics by Prime Minister Milo Đukanović (2008-2010 and 2012–2016) as explanations for its description as such. Đukanović held a number of senior government positions, including the Presidency, before and after the dissolution of the union between Serbia and Montenegro. In 2021, the *Economist Democracy Index* (EDI) declared Montenegro as a \"flawed democracy\" and as of 2023,[update] it remains regarded as such by the EDI. \n\n\nĐukanović's pro-European and pro-NATO Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) narrowly lost the 2020 parliamentary election which ended the party's 30-year rule[102] and the pro-Serbia \"For the Future of Montenegro\" (ZBCG) parliamentary group, composed mainly of Serb nationalist parties, formed a government under Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic.[103] Prime Minister Krivokapic's government was toppled in a no-confidence vote after just 14 months in power.[104]\n\n\nIn April 2022, a new minority government, led by Prime Minister Dritan Abazović, brought together moderate parties that are both pro-European and pro-Serb. However, his government lost a confidence vote after only 113 days. Montenegro had been unable to find a government which could command the confidence of the Parliament,[105] Abazović remains in post following the Parliamentary election which took place on 11 June 2023 where the Europe Now! party led by Jakov Milatović won the most seats,[4] Jakov Milatović having won the 2023 Montenegrin presidential election and taken office on 20 May 2023. [106]Milojko Spajić became prime minister designate in August 2023 and new prime minister on 31 October.[5]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of Montenegro\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs was given the task of defining the foreign policy priorities and activities needed for their implementation in cooperation with other state administration authorities, the President, the Speaker of the Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders.[107]\n\n\nThe country joined NATO on 5 June 2017.[108] Integration into the European Union remains a high-priority for Montenegro and has been the focus of Montenegrin foreign policy since its independence from Serbia.[109] In June 2023, newly elected President Milatović stated that he expects Montenegro to join the European Union by 2027 or 2028.[110]\n\n\n\n### Military and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Armed Forces of Montenegro\n\n![](image)Montenegrin army soldiers with NATO allies from United States, Croatia, Albania, Slovenia and North Macedonia during \"Immediate Response 2012\", Slunj, Croatia.\nThe military of Montenegro is a professional standing army under the Ministry of Defence. It is composed of the Montenegrin Ground Army, the Montenegrin Navy, and the Montenegrin Air Force, along with special forces. Conscription was abolished in 2006. The military maintains an active duty force of 2,400. The bulk of its equipment and forces were inherited from the armed forces of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro contained the entire coastline of the former union and retained practically the entire naval force.\n\n\nMontenegro is a NATO member[111] and a member of Adriatic Charter.[112] The government planned to have the army participate in peacekeeping missions through the UN and NATO such as the International Security Assistance Force.[113]\n\n\nCivil law enforcement in Montenegro is primarily the responsibility of the Police Directorate, the national police force. Municipal police, known as Communal Police in Montenegro, enforce local laws in their respective municipalities.[114]\n\n\nAn agreement signed with the EU effective July 2023 permits EU Frontex border management personnel to operate in Montenegro in support of local border police operating on other, non EU, borders in Montenegro.[115]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nSee also: National symbols of Montenegro\n\n![](image)The Mausoleum of Petar II Petrović-Njegoš in Lovćen.\nThe flag includes a border and arms in gold and a golden lion in the center.\n\n\nThe national day of 13 July marks the date in 1878 when the Congress of Berlin recognised Montenegro as the 27th independent state in the world[116] and the start of one of the first popular uprisings in Europe against the Axis Powers on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.\n\n\nIn 2004, the Montenegrin legislature selected a popular Montenegrin traditional song, \"Oh, Bright Dawn of May\", as the national anthem. Montenegro's official anthem during the reign of King Nicholas I was *Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori* (\"To Our Beautiful Montenegro\").\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Municipalities of Montenegro and List of regions of Montenegro\n\nMontenegro is divided into twenty-four municipalities (*opština*). This includes 21 District-level Municipalities and 2 Urban Municipalities, with two subdivisions of Podgorica municipality, listed below. Each municipality can contain multiple cities and towns. Historically, the territory of the country was divided into \"nahije\".\n\n\nRegions of Montenegro—designed for statistical purposes by the Statistical Office—have no administrative function. Note that other organizations (i.e. Football Association of Montenegro) use different municipalities as a part of similar regions.\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities and Statistical regions of Montenegro\nMunicipalities of Montenegro\n* Northern Region\n\n\n\n\n| Municipality\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Km² | Rank\n | Total | Rank\n |\n| Andrijevica | 283 | 12 | 5,117 | 10\n |\n| Berane | 544 | 6 | 28,305 | 3\n |\n| Bijelo Polje | 924 | 2 | 46,676 | 1\n |\n| Gusinje | 486 | 8 | 13,108 | 6\n |\n| Kolašin | 897 | 3 | 8,420 | 8\n |\n| Mojkovac | 367 | 11 | 8,669 | 7\n |\n| Petnjica | 173 | 13 | 6,686 | 9\n |\n| Plav | 486 | 7 | 13,549 | 5\n |\n| Plužine | 854 | 4 | 3,286 | 12\n |\n| Pljevlja | 1,346 | 1 | 31,060 | 2\n |\n| Rožaje | 432 | 10 | 23,312 | 4\n |\n| Šavnik | 553 | 5 | 2,077 | 13\n |\n| Žabljak | 445 | 9 | 3,599 | 11\n |\n\n\n* Central Region\n\n\n\n\n| Municipality\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Km² | Rank\n | Total | Rank\n |\n| Cetinje | 899 | 3 | 16,757 | 4\n |\n| Danilovgrad | 501 | 4 | 17,678 | 3\n |\n| Nikšić | 2,065 | 1 | 72,824 | 2\n |\n| Podgorica | 1,399 | 2 | 187,085 | 1\n |\n| Tuzi | 236 | 5 | 12,096 | 5\n |\n\n\n![](image)\nBudva, a coastal peninsular town on the west coast of Montenegro.\n\n* Coastal Region\n\n\n\n\n| Municipality\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Km² | Rank\n | Total | Rank\n |\n| Bar | 598 | 1 | 42,368 | 1\n |\n| Budva | 122 | 5 | 19,170 | 5\n |\n| Herceg Novi | 235 | 4 | 30,992 | 2\n |\n| Kotor | 335 | 2 | 22,799 | 3\n |\n| Tivat | 46 | 6 | 14,111 | 6\n |\n| Ulcinj | 255 | 3 | 20,265 | 4\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Montenegro\n\n![](image)The de facto currency of Montenegro is the euro\nThe economy of Montenegro is mostly service-based and is in late transition to a market economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, the nominal GDP of Montenegro was $5.424 billion in 2019.[6] The GDP PPP for 2019 was $12.516 billion, or $20,083 per capita.[6] According to Eurostat data, the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 48% of the EU average in 2018.[117]\n\n\nMontenegro joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement in 2007 and the European Free Trade Association in 2011. The Central Bank of Montenegro is not part of the euro system but the country is \"euroised\", using the euro unilaterally as its currency. Montenegro was ranked 75th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[118]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Montenegro\n\nThe Montenegrin road infrastructure is not at Western European standards. No roads meet full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nRoads of Montenegro in service and planned\n![](image)\nA-1 motorway, part of the larger international project between Montenegro and neighboring Serbia that connects to the Belgrade–Bar motorway\n\nThe European routes that pass through Montenegro are E65 and E80.\n\n\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the Belgrade–Bar railway, which provides international connection towards Serbia. A domestic branch line, the Nikšić-Podgorica railway operated as a freight-only line for decades, that opened for passenger traffic after reconstruction and electrification in 2012. The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the Podgorica–Shkodër railway, is not in use.\n\n\nMontenegro has two international airports, Podgorica Airport and Tivat Airport.\n\n\nThe Port of Bar is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Reconstruction began in 1950. It is equipped to handle over five million tons of cargo annually, but has been operating at a loss and well below capacity. The reconstruction of the Belgrade-Bar railway and the proposed Belgrade-Bar motorway are expected to return operating levels to capacity.\n\n\nIn 2023 there is a plan to install an LNG terminal at Bar to receive gas imports.[119]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Montenegro\n\n![](image)\nThe Bay of Kotor, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n![](image)\nDurmitor National Park was founded in 1952, and designated as a World Heritage Site in 1980\n\nA total of 2.1 million visitors visited Montenegro in 2022 spending 12.4m nights there.[120] The majority of foreign visitors to Montenegro come from the neighbouring countries of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, as well as Russia.[121]\n\n\nThe Montenegrin Adriatic coast is 295 km (183 mi) long, with 72 km (45 mi) of beaches and many well-preserved ancient towns. Some of the most popular beaches include Jaz Beach, Mogren Beach, Bečići Beach, Sveti Stefan Beach and Velika Plaža.[122] Meanwhile, some of the most popular ancient towns include Herceg Novi, Perast, Kotor, Budva and Ulcinj.[123]\n\n\n*National Geographic Traveler* (edited once a decade) ranks Montenegro among the \"50 Places of a Lifetime\". Montenegrin seaside town Sveti Stefan was once used as the cover for the magazine.[124] The coast region of Montenegro was considered one of the great \"discoveries\" among world tourists. In January 2010, *The New York Times* ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro, including Velika Plaža, Ada Bojana, and the Hotel Mediteran of Ulcinj, among the \"Top 31 Places to Go in 2010\" as part of a worldwide ranking.[125]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Montenegro and Demographic history of Montenegro\n\n### Ethnic structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThis map represents the spatial distribution of the different Montenegrine cultural communities, definded on the basis of the self-declared ethnicity, religion and mother tongue according to Census 2011\n![](image)\nEthnic structure of Montenegro by settlements, 2011[126]\n![](image)\nReligious structure of Montenegro by settlements, 2011[126]\n\nThe 2011 census reported 620,029 citizens.[127] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2015, 9,486 ethnic Serbs there were born in \"Other Eastern Europe\" countries, overwhelmingly Montenegro.[128] According to the 2000 U.S. census, 2,339 individuals claimed first ancestry in Montenegro, and 189 whose second ancestry was Montenegrin, totaling 2,528 overall.[129]\n\n\nMontenegro is a multiethnic state with no ethnic majority.[130][131] Major ethnic groups include Montenegrins (Црногорци/*Crnogorci*) and Serbs (Срби/*Srbi*); others are Bosniaks (*Bošnjaci*), Muslims (*Muslimani*), Albanians (*Albanci – Shqiptarët*) and Croats (*Hrvati*). The number of \"Montenegrins\" and \"Serbs\" fluctuates widely from census to census due to changes in how people perceive, experience, or choose to express, their identity and ethnic affiliation.[132][133][134] The Montenegrin Roma population is estimated to be 20,000.[135]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Montenegro\n\n![](image)\nThe Mountain Wreath, poetic chronicle of the struggle of people of Montenegro during Montenegrin–Ottoman War, for freedom and independence from Ottoman Empire.\n![](image)\nOstrog Orthodox monastery situated against an almost vertical background, high up in the large rock of Ostroška Greda, it is the most visited religious shrine in the country, which is gladly visited by both Orthodox Christians and Catholics, as well as people of other religions.\n\nThe official language in Montenegro is Montenegrin. Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian are recognised in official usage. Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are mutually intelligible as standard varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language. Montenegrin is the plurality mother-tongue of the under-18 population.[136] Previous constitutions endorsed Serbo-Croatian as the official language in SR Montenegro and Serbian of the Ijekavian standard during the 1992–2006 period.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Montenegro\n\nMontenegro has historically stood at the crossroads of multiculturalism and over centuries this has shaped its unique co-existence between Muslim and Christian populations.[137] Montenegrins have historically been members of the Serbian Orthodox Church (governed by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral). Serbian Orthodox Christianity is the most popular religion. The Montenegrin Orthodox Church was recently founded and is followed by a minority of Montenegrins, although it is not in communion with any other canonical Christian Orthodox Church as it has not been officially recognised.\n\n\nDespite tensions between religious groups during the Bosnian War, Montenegro remained fairly stable, mainly due to its population's perspective on religious tolerance and faith diversity.[138] Religious institutions have guaranteed rights and are separate from the state. The second largest religion is Islam, practiced by 19% of the population. Montenegro has one of the highest proportion of Muslims in Europe and the third highest proportion among Slavic countries, behind only Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. A little more than one-fourth of the country's Albanians are Catholics (8,126 in the 2004 census) while the rest (22,267) are mainly Sunni Muslims; in 2012 a protocol recognised Islam as an official religion, which ensures that halal foods are served at military facilities, hospitals, dormitories and social facilities; and that Muslim women are permitted to wear headscarves in schools and at public institutions, as well as ensuring that Muslims have the right to take Fridays off for the Jumu'ah (Friday)-prayer.[139] Since the time of Vojislavljević dynasty Catholicism is autochthonous in the Montenegrin area.[140] A small Roman Catholic population, mostly Albanians with some Croats, is divided between the Archdiocese of Antivari headed by the Primate of Serbia and the Diocese of Kotor that is a part of the Catholic Church in Croatia.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Montenegro\n\n![](image)\nNational Museum of Montenegro\n![](image)\nBoka Navy, from 2021 part of intangible World Heritage UNESCO\n\nMontenegrin culture has been shaped most importantly by Orthodox, Ottoman (Turk), Slavic, Central European, and seafaring Adriatic cultures (notably parts of Italy, like the Republic of Venice).\n\n\nMontenegro has many significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is known for its religious monuments, including the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon in Kotor[141] (Cattaro under the Venetians), the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rocks (Škrpjela), the Savina Monastery and others. Medieval monasteries contain many artistically important frescoes.\n\n\nOne cultural dimension is the ethical ideal of *Čojstvo i Junaštvo*, \"Humaneness and Gallantry\".[142][143] The traditional folk dance of the Montenegrins is the Oro, the \"eagle dance\" that involves dancing in circles with couples alternating in the centre, and is finished by forming a human pyramid of dancers standing on each other's shoulders.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Montenegro\n\nTelevision, magazines, and newspapers are operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations that depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. The Constitution of Montenegro guarantees freedom of speech. Montenegro's media system is under transformation, along with the rest of the country.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Montenegro\n\nSport in Montenegro revolves mostly around team sports, such as water polo, football, basketball, handball, and volleyball. Other sports involved are boxing, tennis, swimming, judo, karate, athletics, table tennis, and chess.\n\n\nWater polo is the most popular and is considered the national sport.[144] Montenegro men's national water polo team is one of the world's top ranked teams, winning the gold medal at the 2008 Men's European Water Polo Championship in Málaga, Spain, and winning the gold medal at the 2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League, held in Podgorica. The Montenegrin team PVK Primorac from Kotor became a champion of Europe at the LEN Euroleague 2009 in Rijeka, Croatia. Montenegro came fourth in the men's water polo in the 2016 Olympics.\n\n\nFootball is the second most popular sport.[144] Notable players are Dejan Savićević, Predrag Mijatović, Mirko Vučinić, Stefan Savić, Stevan Jovetić, and Stefan Mugoša. The Montenegro national football team, founded in 2006, played in playoffs for UEFA Euro 2012, its highest play appearance. The Montenegro national basketball team is known for good performances and won a lot of medals as part of the Yugoslavia national basketball team. In 2006, the Basketball Federation of Montenegro along with this team joined the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) on its own, following the Independence. Montenegro participated in two EuroBaskets.\n\n\nAmong women sports, the national handball team is the most successful, winning the country's first Olympic medal, claiming silver at the 2012 Summer Olympics. This was followed by the 2012 European Championship which Montenegro won, becoming European champions. ŽRK Budućnost Podgorica has twice won the EHF Champions League. Montenegro was one of the host countries for the 2022 European Women's Handball Championship and came third.\n\n\nChess is another popular sport and notable global chess players such as Slavko Dedić were born there.\n\n\n\n* ![Danka Kovinić, tennis player](image)\n\nDanka Kovinić, tennis player\n* ![Stevan Jovetić, football player](image)\n\nStevan Jovetić, football player\n* ![Football fans at Podgorica City Stadium.](image)\n\nFootball fans at Podgorica City Stadium.\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Montenegrin cuisine\n\n![](image)Foods from Montenegro.\nThe first major influences to Montenegrin cuisine came from the Levant and Turkey: sarma, musaka, pilav, pita, gibanica, burek, ćevapi, kebab, đuveč, and Turkish sweets such as baklava and tulumba. Hungarian cuisine influences stews and sataraš. While Central European cuisine is evident in the prevalence of crêpes, doughnuts, jams, many types of biscuits and cakes, and various kinds of breads. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; with the cuisine in the coastal area differing from that of the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of Mediterranean cuisine, with seafood being a common dish. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's Adriatic coast, unlike its heartland, have been significantly influenced by Italian cuisine.[145]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Montenegro real estate taxes\n* Outline of Montenegro\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Written identically in Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian.\n2. **^** Written identically in Serbian Cyrillic.\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Podgorica is the administrative capital while Cetinje is considered the old royal capital\n2. **^** \"Language and alphabet Article 13\". *Constitution of Montenegro*.

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\nThe HDI is the most widely used indicator of human development and has changed how people view the concept.[3][4] However, several aspects of the index have received criticism. Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\nTo reflect developmental differences within countries, a subnational HDI (SHDI) featuring data for more than 1,600 regions was introduced in 2018 by the Global Data Lab at Radboud University in the Netherlands.[10] In 2020, the UNDP introduced another index, the planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), which decreases the scores of countries with a higher ecological footprint.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and indicators[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![World map](image)Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 published in 2022* ≥ 1.4%\n* 1.2%…1.4%\n* 1%…1.2%\n* 0.8%…1%\n* 0.6%…0.8%\n* 0.4%…0.6%\n* 0.2%…0.4%\n* 0%…0.2%\n* −0.5%…0%\n* −1%…−0.5%\n* < −1%\n* No data\n\nThe Human Development Report includes all 193[16] United Nations member states, as well as Palestine and Hong Kong SAR. However, the Human Development Index is not calculated for four of the UN member states: DPR Korea (North Korea), Monaco, Nauru, and Somalia. Some components of the index may be calculated for these countries. The Holy See (Vatican City), the Cook Islands, and Niue are the only state parties within the United Nations System that are not included in the report.[17] In total, the HDI is available for 191 nations.[2]\n\n\nGlobal Data Lab also provides data on the HDI of Somalia, putting it at 0.361 (2019), the lowest in the world.[18]\n\n\nCountries ranked from 1 to 66 in 2021 are designated \"very high\" HDI; those ranked from 67 to 115 are designated \"high\" HDI; those ranked from 116 to 159 are denoted \"medium\" HDI; and those ranked from 160 to 191 are designated \"low\" HDI.[19][13]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of countries by HDI\n| Rank\n | Nation\n | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Change since 2015​[20] | 2021 data (2022 report)​[2] | Average

groups of countries. These include regional groupings based on the UNDP regional classifications,[21] HDI groups including the countries currently falling into a given HDI bracket, OECD members and various other UN groupings.[22] The aggregate HDI values are calculated in the same way as for individual countries with the input data being the weighted average for all countries with available data in the group.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of regions and groups by HDI[24]\n| Region or group | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2015 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OECD | 0.795 | 0.840 | 0.875 | 0.893 | 0.901 | 0.905 | 0.897 | 0.899\n |\n| *Very high human development* | 0.784 | 0.826 | 0.868 | 0.889 | 0.898 | 0.902 | 0.895 | 0.896\n |\n| Europe and Central Asia | 0.664 | 0.681 | 0.746 | 0.783 | 0.798 | 0.802 | 0.793 | 0.796\n |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 0.633 | 0.689 | 0.733 | 0.758 | 0.766 | 0.768 | 0.755 | 0.754\n |\n| *High human development* | 0.557 | 0.625 | 0.700 | 0.734 | 0.751 | 0.756 | 0.753 | 0.754\n |\n| East Asia and the Pacific | 0.507 | 0.592 | 0.684 | 0.722 | 0.741 | 0.748 | 0.748 | 0.749\n |\n| World\n | 0.601 | 0.645 | 0.697 | 0.724 | 0.736 | 0.739 | 0.735 | 0.732\n |\n| Small Island Developing States | 0.601 | 0.649 | 0.693 | 0.723 | 0.734 | 0.738 | 0.732 | 0.730\n |\n| Arab states | 0.555 | 0.618 | 0.676 | 0.697 | 0.711 | 0.715 | 0.708 | 0.708\n |\n| Developing countries | 0.513 | 0.569 | 0.638 | 0.673 | 0.687 | 0.691 | 0.687 | 0.685\n |\n| *Medium human development* | 0.453 | 0.506 | 0.582 | 0.627 | 0.643 | 0.645 | 0.642 | 0.636\n |\n| South Asia | 0.442 | 0.500 | 0.576 | 0.623 | 0.640 | 0.641 | 0.638 | 0.632\n |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | 0.407 | 0.430 | 0.503 | 0.534 | 0.547 | 0.552 | 0.549 | 0.547\n |\n| Least developed countries | 0.357 | 0.408 | 0.487 | 0.520 | 0.537 | 0.542 | 0.542 | 0.540\n |\n| *Low human development* | 0.356 | 0.399 | 0.477 | 0.506 | 0.518 | 0.522 | 0.519 | 0.518\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by Human Development Index by region\n\t+ Africa\n\t+ Asia and Oceania\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ Latin America\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index (HDI) | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.
