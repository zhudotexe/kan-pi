Such definition excludes non-building structures, such as towers.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the world's tallest buildings\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3800 years[3] until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The Strasbourg Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.\n\n\nThe first skyscraper was pioneered in Chicago with the 138 ft (42.1 m) Home Insurance Building in 1885. The United States would remain the location of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then, two other buildings have gained the title: Taipei 101 in 2004 and Burj Khalifa in 2010.[4] Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Middle East, China, and Southeast Asia have experienced booms in skyscraper construction.[5]\n\n\n\n## Ranking criteria and alternatives[edit]\n\n\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.[6] The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828 m (2,717 ft).[6] However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\n\n\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller,[7] the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:[8]\n\n\n\n* height to structural or architectural top;\n* height to floor of highest occupied floor;\n* height to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009);[9] and\n* height to top of any part of the building.\n\n\nAll categories measure the building from the level of the lowest significant open-air pedestrian entrance.[10]\n\n\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.[8]\n\n\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae.[8] In 1930, this definitional argument led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire, was 282.5 m (927 ft) tall, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1 m (125 ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9 m (1,046 ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\n\n\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at 255 m (837 ft). They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30 m (98 ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.[11]\n\n\nThe Burj Khalifa currently tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Tallest buildings in the world[edit]\n\n\nAs of 13 June 2024, this list includes all 93 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) that reach a height of 340 metres (1,120 ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. The building is considered as architecturally topped out when it is under construction, structurally topped out, fully clad, and the highest finished architectural elements are in place.[10]\n\n\nOf these buildings, almost half are in China. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at 417 metres (1,368 ft) after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001. If the Twin Towers were never destroyed, and One World Trade Center was never built, the WTC towers would rank 35 and 36 on the list today.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **bold** | Denotes building that is or was once the tallest in the world\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Image\n | Coordinates\n | City\n | Country\n | Height[14] | Floors\n | Year\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| m\n | ft\n |\n| 1\n | **Burj Khalifa** | ![](image) | 25°11′50″N 55°16′27″E﻿ / ﻿25.19722°N 55.27417°E﻿ / 25.19722;

However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\n\n\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now named Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\n\n\nIf the World Trade Center towers were still standing, the North (1,368 feet (417 m)) and South Towers (1,362 feet (415.1 m)) would fall between numbers 35 and 36 on the current list (it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| †\n | Denotes building with pinnacle height higher than

Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures including towers, are not included. Some assessments of the tallest building use 'height to roof' to determine tallest building, as 'architectural feature' is regarded as a subjective and an imprecise comparative measure. However, in November 2009, the CTBUH stopped using the roof height as the metric for tall buildings because modern tall buildings rarely have a part of the building that can categorically be deemed the roof.[107]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Building\n | City\n | Country\n | Height (m)\n | Height (ft)\n | Floors\n | Built\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 |

The UAE's economy is the 4th largest in the Middle East (after Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel), with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$498 billion (AED 1.83 trillion) in 2023.[1]\n\n\nThe UAE economy is heavily reliant on revenues from petroleum and natural gas, especially in Abu Dhabi. In 2009, more than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports.[14][15] In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.[16] In recent years, there has been some economic diversification,[17] particularly in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification. Dubai has far smaller oil reserves than its counterparts.[18]\n\n\nTourism is one of the biggest non-oil sources of revenue in the UAE. A massive construction boom, an expanding manufacturing base, and a thriving services sector are helping the country to diversify its economy. Nationwide, there is currently US$350 billion worth of active construction projects.[19]\n\n\nThe UAE is a member of the World Trade Organization and OPEC.\n\n\n\n\n## Economic overview[edit]\n\n\nUAE has the second-largest economy in the Arab world (after Saudi Arabia),[20] with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414 billion (AED 1.52 trillion) in 2018.[21] A third of the GDP is from oil revenues.[20] The economy was expected to grow 4–4.5% in 2013, compared to 2.3–3.5% over the previous five years. Since independence in 1971, UAE's economy has grown by nearly 231 times to AED1.45 trillion in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to AED1.2 trillion, a growth of around 28 times from 1981 to 2012.[20]\n\n\nThe UAE's economy is one of the most open worldwide, and its economic history goes back to the times when ships sailed to India, along the Swahili coast, as far south as Mozambique.[22]\n\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) expected UAE's economic growth to increase to 4.5% in 2015, compared to 4.3% in 2014. The IMF ascribed UAE's potentially strong economic growth in World Economic Outlook Report to the increased contribution of non-petroleum sectors, which registered a growth average of more than 6% in 2014 and 2015. Such contribution includes banking, tourism, commerce and real estate. Increase of Emirati purchasing power and governmental expenditures in infrastructure projects have considerably increased.\n\n\nInternationally, UAE is ranked among the top 20 for global service business, according to AT Kearney, the top 30 on the WEF \"most-networked countries\" and in the top quarter as a least corrupt country per the TI's corruption index.[23]\n\n\nThe government of the United Arab Emirates announced a broad restructuring and merger of more than 50% of its federal agencies, including ministries and departments, in an attempt to deal with and recover from the economic shocks following months-long coronavirus lockdown.[24]\n\n\n\n## Historical background[edit]\n\n\nBefore independence from the United Kingdom and unification in 1971, each emirate was responsible for its own economy. At the time, pearl diving, seafaring and fishing were together the mainstay of the economy, until the development of Japanese cultured pearls and the discovery of commercial quantities of oil.[25] Previous UAE President Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan is credited with bringing the country forward into the 20th century and using the revenue from oil exports to fund all the necessary development. Likewise, former UAE vice-president Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum had a bold vision for the Emirate of Dubai and foresaw the future in not petroleum alone, but also other industries.[26]\n\n\nIn the 1980s Dubai's diversification centred around trade and the creation of shipping and logistics centres, notably Port Rashid and the port and Free Zone of Jebel Ali as well as Dubai International Airport,[27] leading to a number of major global plays in shipping, transportation and logistics (DP World, Emirates, DNATA).\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nThe emergence of Dubai's lively real estate market was briefly checked by the global financial crisis of 2007–8, when Dubai was bailed out by Abu Dhabi.[28] The recovery from the overheated market led to tighter regulation and oversight and a more realistic market for real estate throughout the UAE with many 'on hold' projects restarting. Although the market continues to expand, current market conditions for developers have been characterised as 'tough'.[29]\n\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 pandemic, the UAE’s economy shrank by 6.1% in 2020.[30]  The country’s account balance dropped to six per cent of GDP in 2020 from 8.5 per cent in 2019 due to the underperformance of both hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon exports mitigated by lower imports.[31]\n\n\nIn late 2021, the authority announced that UAE’s banking assets are expected to grow by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent in 2022 as the second-biggest Arab economy continues to recover from the covid-19 pandemic.[32] It was also announced the UAE’s economy might grow at a faster than projected rate, reaching 4.6% in 2022.[33]\n\n\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027).[34] Inflation below 5% is in green. The annual unemployment rate is extracted from the World Bank, although the International Monetary Fund find them unreliable.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | GDP\n(in Bil.

the region. Exports totaled $314 billion, making UAE the second largest exporter in the region.[20]\n\n\nUAE and India are each other's main trading partners, with the latter having many of its citizens working and living in the former. The trade totals over $75 billion (AED275.25 billion).[36]\n\n\nIn 2021, the main export partners of the UAE were India (14.2%), Japan (8.3%), China (mainland) (7.7%), Saudi Arabia (7.5%), Iraq (4.8%), Singapore (4.0%), the European Union (4.0%), Oman (3.8%), Hong Kong (3.4%), and Thailand (3.0%).[12]\n\n\nThe main import partners in 2012 were China (17.3%), the European Union (12.1%), India (9.4%), the United States (5.5%), Saudi Arabia (5.2%), the United Kingdom (2.8%), Mali (2.7%), Japan (2.6%), Turkey (2.1%), and Vietnam (2.0%).[12]\n\n\n\n## Diversification of UAE's economy[edit]\n\n\nAlthough UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE's economy remains extremely reliant on oil.[*citation needed*] With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. More than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009.[14][15] While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy.[18] In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.[16]\n\n\nDubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007–2010 and was bailed out by Abu Dhabi's oil wealth. Dubai's current prosperity has been attributed to Abu Dhabi's petrodollars.[37] In 2014, Dubai owed a total of $142 billion in debt.[38] The UAE government has worked towards reducing the economy's dependence on oil exports by 2030.[39] Various projects are underway to help achieve this, the most recent being the Khalifa Port, opened in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi at the end of 2012. The UAE has also won the right to host the World Expo 2020, which is believed to have a positive effect on future growth, although there are some skeptics which mention the opposite.[40]\n\n\nOver the decades, the Emirate of Dubai has started to look for additional sources of revenue. High-class tourism and international finance continue to be developed. In line with this initiative, the Dubai International Financial Centre was announced, offering 55.5% foreign ownership, no withholding tax, freehold land and office space and a tailor-made financial regulatory system with laws taken from best practice in other leading financial centers like New York, London, Zürich and Singapore.[*citation needed*] A new stock market for regional companies and other initiatives were announced in DIFC. Dubai has also developed Internet and Media free zones, offering 100% foreign ownership, no tax office space for the world's leading ICT and media companies, with the latest communications infrastructure to service them. Many of the world's leading companies have now set up branch offices, and even changed headquarters to, there. Recent liberalization in the property market allowing non citizens to buy freehold land has resulted in a major boom in the construction and real estate sectors, with several signature developments such as the 2 Palm Islands, the World (archipelago), Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Lake Towers, and a number of other developments, offering villas and high rise apartments and office space. Emirates (part of the Emirates Group) was formed by the Dubai Government in the 1980s and is presently one of the few airlines to witness strong levels of growth. Emirates is also the largest operator of the Airbus A380 aircraft. As of 2001[update], budgeted government revenues were about AED 29.7 billion, and expenditures were about AED 22.9 billion. In addition, to finding new ways of sustaining the national economy, the UAE has also made progress in installing new, sustainable methods of generating electricity. This is evidenced by various solar energy initiatives at Masdar City and by other renewable energy developments in parts of the country.[41][42]\n\n\nIn addition, the UAE is starting to see the emergence of local manufacturing as new source of economic development, examples of significant government-led investments such as Strata in aerospace industry, under Mubadala are successful, while there are also small scale entrepreneurial ventures picking up, such as Zarooq Motors in the automotive industry.[43]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the Barakah nuclear power plant, the first nuclear power plant in the Arab world, became operational.[44]\n\n\n\n## Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\nConcerning foreign trade, UAE's market is one of the world's most dynamic markets worldwide, placed among the 16 largest exporters and 20 largest importers of commodities.[45] The top five of the Main Partner Countries of the UAE in 2014 are Iran (3.0%), India (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (1.5%), Oman (1.4%) and Switzerland (1.2%). As for the top five of UAE suppliers are China (7.4%), United States (6.4%), India (5.8%), Germany (3.9%) and Japan (3.5%).\n\n\n\n\n\nUAE's Foreign Trade Indicators[46]\n| Indicator\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Imports of Goods***(million USD)* | 165,000\n | 203,000\n | 226,000\n | 251,000\n | 262,000\n |\n| **Exports of Goods***(million USD)* | 214,000\n | 302,000\n | 349,000\n | 379,000\n | 360,000\n |\n| **Imports of Services***(million USD)* | 41,337\n | 55,702\n | 62,301\n | 66,413\n | 70,279\n |\n| **Exports of Services***(million USD)* | 11,028\n | 12,063\n | 15,276\n | 17,345\n | 19,769\n |\n| **Imports of Goods and Services***(Annual % Change)* | 2.1\n | 18.8\n | 5.2\n | 6.5\n | 6.1\n |\n| **Exports of Goods and Services***(Annual % Change)* | 2.5\n | 20.7\n | 17.0\n | 4.5\n | 8.2\n |\n| **Imports of Goods and Services***(in % of GDP)* | 72.2\n | 72.3\n | 75.3\n | 76.8\n | 77.9\n |\n| **Exports of Goods and Services***(in % of GDP)* | 78.8\n | 90.3\n | 100.6\n | 101.3\n | 98.0\n |\n\n\nIn 2014, the United Arab Emirates managed to export 380.4bn dominated by four products which are Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous...[*permanent dead link*] (19.8%) Diamonds, whether or not worked, but not mounted...[*permanent dead link*] (3.4%) Gold in UAE(3.2%) incl. gold plated with platinum, unwrought...Articles of jewellery and parts thereof, of...[*permanent dead link*](2.8%).

On the other hand, it imported 63.9 bn USD of services imported services dominated by transportation (70.68%), travel (27.70%) and government services (1.62%).\n\n\nIn September 2021, the UAE announced its plans to aggravate its trade ties with other economies, particularly in Asia and Africa. The country indicated that it was looking for inward foreign investments of around $150 billion in the next nine years, that is, by 2030. The Emirates aimed to be one of the world’s ten biggest investment nations. However, it had to face strong competition from its neighbor, Saudi Arabia, creating a broader gap in the once-assumed alliance between the two countries. The Emirati minister of state for foreign trade said, “Let the Saudis increase the competition. It means the pie is going to be bigger and having a bigger pie means that the UAE share out of this pie is going to be bigger.”[47]\n\n\nThe EU identified that the Emirati firms were involved in direct trade of weapon components to Russia. The EU sanctions targeted two UAE-based companies, I Jet Global and Success Aviation Services, which were exporting dual-use goods. The EU warned that countries that will be used for Russia’s benefit could face a total ban on imports from the EU military and high tech kit. Besides, a trade war with UAE was expected, if it continued trade with Russia.[48]\n\n\n\n## Human Resources and Employment[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Human rights in the United Arab Emirates\n\nMany buildings were built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia.[49][50] This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and not private sector employment.[51][52] On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the Burj Khalifa construction site.[53] Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned £4.34 a day, and labourers earned £2.84.[49] According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay.[54][55][56] During construction, only one construction-related death was reported.[57] However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are \"poorly documented\", according to Human Rights Watch.[54]\n\n\nIn March 2006 about 2,500 workers, upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers and construction equipment.[49] A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost £500,000 in damage.[49] Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.[49] Workers at Dubai airport also protested.\n\n\n\n### Emiratisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Two south east Asian blue-collar workers posing for a picture with Burj Khalifa on the background.\nEmiratisation is an initiative by the government of the UAE to employ more UAE Nationals in a meaningful and efficient manner in the public and private sectors.[58][59] While the program has been in place for more than a decade and results can be seen in the public sector, the private sector is still lagging behind with citizens only representing 0.34% of the private sector workforce.[60]\n\n\nWhile there is general agreement over the importance of Emiratisation for social, economic and political reasons, there is also some contention as to the impact of localization on organizational efficiency. It is yet unknown whether, and the extent to which, employment of nationals generates returns for MNEs operating in the Middle East. Recent research cautions that localization is not always advantageous for firms operating in the region, and its effectiveness depends on a number of contingent factors.[61][62]\n\n\nIn December 2009 however, a positive impact of UAE citizens in the workplace was identified in a newspaper article citing a yet unpublished study,[63] this advantage being the use of networks within the evolving power structures.\n\n\nOverall, however, uptake in the private sector remains low regardless of significant investments in education, which have reached record levels with education now accounting for 22.5% – or $2.6 billion – of the overall budget planned for 2010.[64] Multiple governmental initiatives are actively promoting Emiratisation by training anyone from high school dropouts to graduates in a multitude of skills needed for the – essentially Western – work environment of the UAE, these initiatives include Tawteen UAE,[65] ENDP[66] or the Abu Dhabi Tawteen Council.[67]\n\n\nThere are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis – and other GCC nationals – being given preference when it comes to employment.[68] Unions are generally banned and workers with any labour issues are advised to be in touch with the Ministry of Labour, instead of protesting or refusing to work. Migrant employees often complain of poor workplace safety and wages based on nationality, although this is being slowly addressed.[69]\n\n\nBeyond directly sponsoring educational initiatives, the Emirates Foundation for Philanthropy[70] is funding major research initiatives into Emiratisation through competitive research grants, allowing universities such as United Arab Emirates University or Dubai School of Government to build and disseminate expertise on the topic.\n\n\nAcademics working on various aspects of Emiratisation include *Paul Dyer*[12] and *Natasha Ridge* from Dubai School of Government, *Ingo Forstenlechner*[13] from United Arab Emirates University, *Kasim Randaree* from the British University of Dubai and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.\n\n\nIn 2020, economy of the United Arab Emirates became vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, witnessing an economic shutdown. Among the Emirates, Dubai was facing extreme situation, where the expat workers were left jobless. Thousands of the Britons working in the city started selling off their possessions to collect money, as the strict visa regulations forced them to return to the UK.[71]\n\n\nAccording to an April 2021 report published by the Democracy Centre for Transparency on the *Discrimination against foreigners and expatriates living in the UAE versus Emirati citizens*, despite labor reforms in the UAE, foreigners and skilled or unskilled migrant workers face discrimination and racialization[*clarification needed*] from the citizens of the country. Foreigners and expatriates are often subjected to discrimination at work concerning promotions and wages, or gender inequality. The findings of the DCT concern the organization as the UAE’s economy largely relies on foreign workers and thus fulfills a crucial international role. The organization demands that the UAE abide by universal human rights principles.[72][73]\n\n\nThe 31st edition of World Report 2021 released by Human Rights Watch reiterates that labour abuses driven by an exploitative kafala system are persistent in the UAE. During the Covid-19 pandemic, migrant workers faced massive unemployment issues and were also left stranded in dire conditions without legal residencies. Also, many migrants suffered wage theft and were unable to pay rent or buy food.[74]\n\n\n\n## Investment[edit]\n\n\nThe stock market capitalization of listed companies in the UAE was valued at $109.9 billion in October 2012 by Bloomberg.[75]\n\n\n\n### Outward investment[edit]\n\n\nA investment institutions were created by the government to promote manage investments made by the UAE abroad:\n\n\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA)\n\n\n\n* Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC)\n* Mubadala Development Company (MDC)\n* International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC)\n* Dubai World\n* Dubai International Capital (DIC)[76]\n\n\n### Inward investment[edit]\n\n\nThe UAE is in the 17th position in term of the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The report says that the UAE competitiveness stems from \"high quality [...] infrastructure\" and \"highly efficient good markets.\" [77]\n\n\n\n## Corporate Governance Code[edit]\n\n\nThe Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) introduced a new corporate governance regulation (the Corporate Governance Code), which applies to all joint stock companies and institutions whose securities are listed on Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) in 2009.[78]\n\n\n\n## Banking[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 June 2020, rating agency Moody's changed its outlook regarding eight banks in the United Arab Emirates from stable to negative. The change was due to “the potential material weakening in their standalone credit profiles”, where the UAE's economy was facing additional challenges amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices. The eight banks included Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Emirates NBD, HSBC Bank Middle East, Dubai Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, National Bank of Fujairah, National Bank of Ras al-Khaimah and Mashreq Bank.[79]\n\n\nThe Fitch Ratings in its June 22, 2020 report predicted that the Standalone Credit Profiles of UAE-based banks are to possibly weaken in the following year owing to the financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and oil price collapse. As per the Fitch report, despite the implementation of timely measures for supporting the economy, the profitability of banks in the UAE are prone to get affected by a lower non-interest income worsened by a controlled business volume, lower interest rates, and higher loan recovery charges. In addition, the asset quality is expected to weaken, too, following the unbearable impact of the economic downturn that all borrowers may not be able to withstand.[80]\n\n\n\n## Real estate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dubai International Financial Center\nThe development in the real estate and infrastructure sectors during the recent year has contributed in making the country a global touristic destination. The contribution of tourism in the Emirati GDP increased from 3% in the mid-1990s to more than 16.5% by the end of 2010. This trend is supported by the huge public investments in touristic projects (47 Billion Dollars per annum) carried mainly to expend airports, increase their capacity, set up new airports and ports.\n\n\nThe real estate sector have a positive impact on development, job opportunities, investments and tourism as estate projects were launched to meet the needs of market and the increasing demand for housing and commercial units especially in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\nThe UAE has about 37% of the region's petroleum and gas industries, chemical industries, energy and water and garbage projects. The UAE's government have been injecting huge funds in tourism and real estate projects, especially in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Al Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi and Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest tower in the world, world central near “Jebel Ali” are a point in case of the milestones that have given the UAE its high profile of a global tourist destination. According to 2013–2014 Global Competitiveness Report, the UAE ranked fourth worldwide in terms of infrastructure quality.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2020, the Abu Dhabi Media Office announced that the government of United Arab Emirates, ahead of the 49th National Day, granted house loans, land and homes worth $2 billion (7.2 billion dirhams) to their citizens. The package is said to consist 3,099 plots, 2,000 house loans and 601 homes and exempting some families of the deceased citizens and retirees from the repayment of mortgage. The Director General of the Abu Dhabi Housing Society, Basheer Al Mehairbi said the initiative of providing sustainable housing aimed at ensuring a good standard of living for the citizens of the UAE.[81]\n\n\n\n### Real-estate projects[edit]\n\n\nSome of the significant real-estate projects are:\n\n\n\n* Burj Khalifa\n* Creek Tower\n* Mohammed bin Rashid City\n* Falcon City of Wonders\n* International City\n* Dubai Marina\n* Jumeirah Beach Residence\n* Jumeirah Lakes Towers (JLT)\n* Business Bay\n* Dubai Hills\n* Dubai South\n* City Walk\n* Al Furjan\n* Dubai Sports City\n* Dubai Motor City\n* Saadiyat Island\n* The World, the Palms and the Palm (artificial islands)\n* Dubai Miracle Garden, the world's largest natural flower garden.\n* Masdar City, a zero carbon, zero waste city.\n* Yas Island, in Abu Dhabi, featuring attractions such as Ferrari World,\n* Yas Marina\n\n\n## Financial centers[edit]\n\n\nAmong the most prominent financial centers in the UAE are:\n\n\n\n* Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), a Dubai-based federal financial free zone\n* Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial centre located on Al Maryah Island\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Ministry of Finance (United Arab Emirates)\n* Economy of Dubai\n* National Bonds Corporation PJSC\n* List of Free Trade Zones in UAE\n* List of largest companies of the United Arab Emirates\n* Human rights in the United Arab Emirates\n* Israel–United Arab Emirates peace agreement\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** the UAE federal budget does not account for emirate-level spending in Abu Dhabi and Dubai\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** \"Report for Selected Countries and Subjects\". *International Monetary Fund*.

This is due to a fast-growing export-oriented economy, a relatively low national income tax, highly affordable local food and transport fuel, as well as a fully subsidized single-payer public healthcare system. Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, which is relatively open and state-oriented.[27][28] The Malaysian economy is highly robust and diversified with the export value of high-tech products in 2020 standing at US$92.1 billion, the second highest in ASEAN.[29] Malaysia exports the second largest volume and value of palm oil products globally, after Indonesia.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic history of Malaysia\n\nAs one of three countries that control the Strait of Malacca, international trade plays a very significant role in Malaysia's economy.[31] At one time, it was the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world.[32]\nManufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, accounting for over 40% of the GDP.[33] Malaysia is also the world's largest Islamic banking and financial centre.\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Malaysia began to imitate the four Asian Tiger economies (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) and committed itself to a transition from being reliant on mining and agriculture to an economy that depends more on manufacturing. In the 1970s, the predominantly mining and agricultural based Malaysian economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s the industrial sector has led Malaysia's growth. High levels of investment played a significant role in this. With Japanese investment, heavy industries flourished and in a matter of years, Malaysian exports became the country's primary growth engine. Malaysia consistently achieved more than 7% GDP growth along with low inflation in the 1980s and the 1990s.\n\n\nIn 1991, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr Mahathir outlined his ideal, Vision 2020 in which Malaysia would become a self-sufficient industrialised nation by 2020.[34] Tan Sri Nor Mohamed, a government minister, said Malaysia could attain developed country status in 2018 if the country's growth remains constant or increases.[35]\n\n\nMalaysia experienced an economic boom and underwent rapid development during the late 20th century and has GDP per capita (nominal) of US$11,062.043 in 2014, and is considered a newly industrialised country.[36][37][38] In 2009, the PPP GDP was US$383.6 billion, about half the 2014 amount, and the PPP per capita GDP was US$8,100, about one third the 2014 amount.[39]\n\n\nIn 2014, the Household Income Survey undertaken by the government indicated that there were 7 million households in Malaysia, with an average of 4.3 members in each household. The average household income of Malaysia increased by 18% to RM5,900 a month, compared to RM5,000 in 2012.\n\n\nAccording to a HSBC report in 2012, Malaysia will become the world's 21st largest economy by 2050, with a GDP of $1.2 trillion (Year 2000 dollars) and a GDP per capita of $29,247 (Year 2000 dollars). The report also says \"The electronic equipment, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas producer will see a substantial increase in income per capita. Malaysian life expectancy, relatively high level of schooling, and above average fertility rate will help in its rapid expansion.\" Viktor Shvets, the managing director in Credit Suisse, has said \"Malaysia has all the right ingredients to become a developed nation.\"[40]\n\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, Malaysian economy was severely afflicted by COVID-19 pandemic that eventually expanded to the rest of the world, and causing the economic shutdown and downturn in the country, worse since 2008. In early December 2020 during the pandemic, Fitch Ratings downgraded the country’s rating from A− to BBB+. Some, such as Hoo Ke Ping at the Kingsley Strategic Institute, suggested that this was because of a lack of communication between the new government and the ratings agency. Others, such as Carmelo Ferlito, from the Centre for Market Education, said it might require something more substantial as the recent budget lacked a strategy for the recovery as well as addressing the political tensions, and also, Shan Saeed at Juwai IQI suggested that the agency had lots its relevance as the analysis was \"Behind the curve\".[*citation needed*] However, COVID-19 recession in the country was ended by 1 April 2022 as COVID-19 Omicron infection rate continued to fall and ahead of the endemic phase.\n\n\n\n## Economic policies[edit]\n\n\n### Monetary policy[edit]\n\n\nMalaysian ringgit was an internationalised currency, which was freely traded around the world. Just before the crisis, the Ringgit was traded RM2.50 at the dollar. Due to speculative activities, the Ringgit fell to as much as RM4.10 to the dollar in matter of weeks. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad decided to impose capital controls to prevent the outflow of the Ringgit in the open market. The Ringgit became non-internationalised and a traveller had to declare to the central bank if taking out more than RM10,000 out of the country and the Ringgit itself was pegged at RM3.80 to the US dollar.\n\n\nThe fixed exchange rate was abandoned in favour of the floating exchange rate in July 2005, hours after China announced the same move.[41] At this point, the Ringgit was still not internationalised. The Ringgit continued to strengthen to 3.18 to the dollar by March 2008 and appreciated as low as 2.94 to the dollar in May 2011. Meanwhile, many aspects of capital control have been slowly relaxed by Bank Negara Malaysia. However, the government continues to not internationalise the Ringgit. The government stated that the Ringgit will be internationalised once it is ready.[42]\n\n\nBank Negara Malaysia for the time being, uses interest rate targeting. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is their policy instrument, and is used to guide the short term interbank rates which will hopefully influence inflation and economic growth.\n\n\n\n### Affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malaysian New Economic Policy\n\nTun Abdul Razak, who was then the Prime Minister, implemented the affirmative action policy named as New Economic Policy (NEP) soon after 13 May Incident in 1969.[43] Prior to the incident, the poverty rates among Malays were extremely high (at 65%) as was discontent between races, particularly towards the Chinese, who controlled 74% of the economy at the time.[44][45] Through NEP, the Bumiputeras majority were given priority and special privileges in housing developments, scholarship admission and also for ownership of publicly listed companies.\n\n\nThe Malaysian New Economic Policy was created in 1971 with the aim of bringing Malays a 30% share of the economy of Malaysia and eradicating poverty amongst Malays, primarily through encouraging enterprise ownership by Bumiputeras. After 40 years of the program, bumiputra equity ownership rose to 23% worth RM167.7 billion in 2010 against 2.4% in 1970.\n\n\nThe NEP was accused of creating an oligarchy, and creating a 'subsidy mentality'.[46] Political parties such as Parti Keadilan Rakyat and Democratic Action Party proposed a new policy which will be equal for every Malaysian, regardless of race.[47] When the Democratic Action Party was elected in the state of Penang in 2008, it announced that it would do away with the NEP, claiming that it \"... breeds nepotism, corruption and systemic inefficiency\".[48]\n\n\nWolfgang Kasper, a professor of economics at University of New South Wales, and once an adviser to Malaysia's Finance Ministry, criticized the NEP, saying that \"NEP handouts (are) making Malays lazy, corrupt & swell-headed. Worst of all, it keeps them poor.\" He also criticized the Federal Government giving cash-handouts and financial aid instead of providing equal access to education to help the marginalized poor to lift their income status.\n\n\nOn 21 April 2009, the prime minister Najib Tun Razak announced the liberalization of 27 services sub-sector by abolishing the 30% bumiputera requirement. The move was seen as a government effort to increase investment in the service sector of the economy. According to the premier, many more sectors of the economy would be liberalized.[49]\n\n\nOn 30 June 2009, the prime minister announced further liberation moves including the dismantling of the Bumiputera equity quotas and repealing the guidelines of the Foreign Investment Committee, which was responsible to monitor foreign shareholding in Malaysian companies. However, any Malaysian companies that wished to list in Malaysia would still need to offer 50 percent of public shareholding spread to Bumiputera investors.[50]\n\n\n\n### Subsidies and price controls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Petrol prices § Malaysia, and Subsidy reform in Malaysia\n\nThe Malaysian government subsidises and controls prices on a lot of essential items to keep the prices low. Prices of items such as palm oil, cooking oil, petrol, flour, bread, rice and other essentials have been kept under market prices to keep cost of living low.[51] As of 2009, 22 per cent of government expenditures were subsidies, with petrol subsidies alone taking up 12 per cent.[52]\n\n\nSince 2010, the government has been gradually reforming Malaysia's subsidy system, via a series of reductions in subsidies for fuel and sugar to improve government finances and to improve economic efficiency. As a result, in December 2014, the government officially ended all fuel subsidies and implemented a 'managed float' system,[53] taking advantage of low oil prices at the time, potentially saving the government almost RM20 billion ringgit (US$5.97 billion) annually.[54]\n\n\n\n### Sovereign wealth funds[edit]\n\n\nThe government owns and operates several sovereign wealth funds that invest in local companies and also foreign companies. One such fund is Khazanah Nasional Berhad which was established in 1993, and as of 31 December 2013 has US$41 billion worth of assets.[55][56] The fund invests in major companies in Malaysia such as CIMB in the banking sector, UEM Group in the construction sector, Telekom Malaysia and Axiata in the communications industry, Malaysia Airports and Malaysia Airlines in the aerospace industry, as well as Tenaga Nasional in the energy sector[57]\n\n\nAnother fund that is owned by the Malaysian government is the Employees Provident Fund which is a retirement fund that as of 31 March 2014, has an asset size of RM597 billion. (US$184 billion),[58] making it the fourth largest pension fund in Asia and seventh largest in the world.[59] Like Khazanah Nasional, the EPF invests and sometimes owns several major companies in Malaysia such as RHB Bank.[60] EPF investment is diversified over a number of sectors but almost 40% of their investment are in the services sector.[61]\n\n\nPermodalan Nasional Berhad is another major fund manager controlled by the Malaysian Government. It offers capital guaranteed mutual funds such as Amanah Saham Bumiputera and Amanah Saham Wawasan 2020 which are open only to Malaysian and in some cases, Bumiputeras.[62]\n\n\n\n### Government influence[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the federal government promotes private enterprise and ownership in the economy, the economic direction of the country is heavily influenced by the government through five years development plans since independence. The economy is also influenced by the government through agencies such as the Economic Planning Unit and government-linked wealth funds such as Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Employees Provident Fund and Permodalan Nasional Berhad.\n\n\nThe government's development plans, called the Malaysian Plan, currently the Tenth Malaysia Plan, started in 1950 during the British colonial rule.[63] The plans were largely centred around accelerating the growth of the economy by selectively investing in selective sectors of the economy and building infrastructure to support said sectors.[63] For example, in the current national plan, three sectors – agriculture, manufacturing and services, will receive special attention to promote the transition to high value-added activities in the respective areas.[64]\n\n\nGovernment-linked investment vehicles such as Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Employees Provident Fund and Permodalan Nasional Berhad invest in and sometimes own major companies in major sectors of the Malaysian economy.\n\n\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027).

![Negative increase](image)70.6%\n |\n\n\n## Currency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malaysian ringgit\n\nThe only legal tender in Malaysia is the Malaysian ringgit. As of 28 January 2023, the ringgit is traded at MYR 4.24 at the US dollar.[66]\n\n\nThe ringgit has not been internationalised[*clarification needed*] since September 1998, due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis in which the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed capital controls on the currency, due to speculative short-selling of the ringgit.[67] As a part of series of capital controls, the currency was pegged between September 1998 and 21 July 2005 at MYR 3.80 to the dollar after dropping from MYR 2.50 per USD to, at one point, MYR 4.80 per USD.[68]\n\n\nIn recent years, Bank Negara Malaysia has begun to relax certain rules on capital controls, although the currency itself is still not traded internationally. According to the Bank Governor, the ringgit will be internationalised when it is ready.[69]\n\n\nIn September 2010, in an interview with CNBC, Dato' Seri Najib Tun Razak, who was the then Prime Minister of Malaysia and also held the position of Finance Minister, said that the government was open to open up the ringgit to offshore trading if the move would help the economy. He added that before such a move could be made, it would ensure that rules and regulation were in place to avoid abuse of the currency.[70]\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Palm oil estate in Malaysia.\nMalaysia is well-endowed with natural resources in areas such as agriculture, forestry and minerals. It is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, the most valuable exported resource being petroleum.[71] In the agricultural sector, Malaysia is one of the top exporters of natural rubber and palm oil, which together with timber and timber products, cocoa, pepper, pineapple and tobacco dominate the growth of the sector.[72] As of 2011, the percentage arable land in Malaysia is 5.44%. Croplands consists of 17.49% while other land uses consists of 77.07%.[73] As of 2009, irrigated land covers 3,800 km2. Total renewable water resources make up 580 cubic km as of 2011.\n\n\nTin and petroleum are the two main mineral resources that are of major significance in the Malaysian economy. Malaysia was once the world's largest producer of tin until the collapse of the tin market in the early 1980s.[74] In the 19th and 20th century, tin played a predominant role in the Malaysian economy, with Malaysia accounting for over 31% of global output. It was only in 1972 that petroleum and natural gas took over from tin as the mainstay of the mineral extraction sector. Other minerals of some importance or significance include copper, bauxite, iron-ore and coal together with industrial minerals like clay, kaolin, silica, limestone, barite, phosphates and dimension stones such as granite as well as marble blocks and slabs. Small quantities of gold are produced.\n\n\nIn 2019, the country was the 11th largest world producer of manganese;[75] the 11th largest world producer of tin,[76] the 12th largest world producer of bauxite,[77] and the 19th largest world producer of lime.[78]\n\n\n\n### Energy resources[edit]\n\n\nMalaysia holds proven oil reserves of 4 billion barrels as of January 2014, the fourth-highest reserves in Asia-Pacific after China, India, and Vietnam. Nearly all of Malaysia's oil comes from offshore fields. The continental shelf is divided into three producing basins: the basin offshore Eastern Peninsular Malaysia in the west and the Sarawak and Sabah basins in the east. Most of the country's oil reserves are located in the Peninsular basin and tend to be light and sweet crude. Malaysia's benchmark crude oil, Tapis Blend, is a light and sweet crude oil, with an API gravity of 42.7° and a sulphur content of 0.04% by weight.\n\n\nMalaysia also holds 83 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven natural gas reserves as of January 2014, and was the third-largest natural gas reserve holder in the Asia-Pacific region after China and Indonesia. More than half of the country's natural gas reserves are located in its eastern areas, predominantly offshore Sarawak. Most of Malaysia's gas reserves are associated with oil basins, although Sarawak and Sabah have an increasing amount of non-associated gas reserves that have offset some of the declines from mature oil and gas basins offshore Peninsular Malaysia.[79]\n\n\n\n## Business environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Malaysia and the World Bank\n\nIn 2015, Malaysia's economy was one of the most competitive in the world, ranking 14th in the world and 5th for countries with a population of over 20 million, higher than countries like Australia, United Kingdom, South Korea and Japan.[80]\n\n\nIn 2015, Malaysia was the 6th most attractive country for foreign investors, ranked in the Baseline Profitability Index (BPI) published by Foreign Policy Magazine.[81]\n\n\nThe government is moving towards a more business friendly environment by setting up a special task force to facilitate business called PEMUDAH, which means \"simplifier\" in Malay.[82] Highlights includes easing restrictions and requirement to hire expatriates, shorten time to do land transfers and increasing the limit of sugar storage (a controlled item in Malaysia) for companies.[83]\n\n\nMalaysia was ranked 33rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2020, up from 35th in 2019.[84][85][86][87]\n\n\n\n## Taxation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia lowered the effective tax rate to 24% for businesses with capital exceeding 2.5 million ringgit. For the smaller companies, the rate is 19%.[88]\n\n\nThe Malaysian government also imposes government taxes such as the Sales and Services tax and real estate taxes. The current rate of SST is at 6% while disposal of property is subject to a schedule of period holding the property.[89]\n\n\n\n## External trade[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Malaysian states and municipalities by exports\nIn 2021, Malaysia's total external trade totaled RM2,227 billion (approximately US$530 billion), made up of RM1,239 billion (approximately US$295 billion) of exports and RM987 billion (approximately US$235 billion) of imports, making Malaysia the world's 21st largest exporter and the world's 25th largest importer.\n\n\nMalaysia's largest trading partner is China. Malaysia has been China's top trading partner within ASEAN for five years in a row since 2008. The two-way trade volume between China and Malaysia in 2013 reached $106 billion, making Malaysia China's third-largest trade partner in Asia, just behind Japan and South Korea and eighth largest overall.[90] On 31 May 2014, during Najib Razak's visit to China where he was welcomed by China's Premier Li Keqiang, China and Malaysia pledged to increase bilateral trade to US$160 billion by 2017. They also agreed to upgrade economic and financial co-operation, especially in the production of halal food, water processing and railway construction.[91]\n\n\nMalaysia's second largest trading partner is Singapore and Malaysia is Singapore's biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling roughly US$91 billion in 2012, accounting for over a fifth of total trade within ASEAN.[92][93]\n\n\nMalaysia's third largest trading partner is Japan, amounting RM137.45 billion (US$42 billion) of trade in 2014, an increase of 1.4% compared with to 2013. Out of this, exports totalled RM82.71 billion (US$25.6 billion), a growth of 4.4% cent while imports contracted 2.9% to RM54.75 billion (US$16.74 billion). Malaysian Ambassador to Japan Datuk Ahmad Izlan Idris said the main exports from Malaysia to Japan were liquefied natural gas (LNG), electrical and electronics as well as chemical-based products. He said Malaysia's main imports from Japan were electrical and electronics, machines and equipment as well as spare parts and accessories for vehicles and cars.[94]\n\n\nMalaysia is an important trading partner for the United States. In 1999, two-way bilateral trade between the US and Malaysia totalled US$30.5 billion, with US exports to Malaysia totalling US$9.1 billion and US imports from Malaysia increasing to US$21.4 billion. Malaysia was the United States' 10th-largest trading partner and its 12th-largest export market. During the first half of 2000, US exports totalled US$5 billion, while US imports from Malaysia reached US$11.6 billion.\n\n\n\n## Agriculture sector[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rubber plantation in Malaysia\nMain article: Agriculture in Malaysia\n\nAgriculture is now a minor sector of the Malaysian economy, accounting for 7.1% of Malaysia's GDP in 2014 and employing 11.1% of Malaysia's labour force, contrasting with the 1960s when agriculture accounted for 37% of Malaysia's GDP and employed 66.2% of the labour force. The crops grown by the agricultural sector has also significantly shifted from food crops like paddy and coconut to industrial crops like palm oil and rubber, which in 2005 contributed to 83.7% of total agricultural land use, compared to 68.5% in 1960.[95]\n\n\n\n### Palm Oil Industry[edit]\n\n\nDespite its minor contribution to Malaysia's GDP, Malaysia has a significant foothold in the world's agricultural sector, being the world's second largest producer of palm oil in 2012[96] producing 18.79 million tonnes of crude palm oil on roughly 5,000,000 hectares (19,000 sq mi) of land.[97][98] Though Indonesia produces more palm oil, Malaysia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil having exported 18 million tonnes of palm oil products in 2011.[99]\n\n\nIn March 2019, the European Commission concluded that palm oil cultivation results in excessive deforestation and its use in transport fuel should be phased out by 2030. In response, Mahathir Mohamad alleged that the European Union is at risk of starting a trade war with Malaysia regarding its \"grossly unfair\" policies geared towards decreasing the use of palm oil, which Mahathir stated was \"unfair\" and an example of \"rich people...[trying] to impoverish poor people\".[100]\n\n\n\n## Industry sector[edit]\n\n\nScience policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products.[71]\n\n\nMalaysia's industrial sector accounts for 36.8%, over a third of the country's GDP in 2014, and employs 36% of the labour force in 2012. The industrial sector mostly contributed by the electronics industry, automotive industry and construction industry.\n\n\n\n### Electrical and electronics[edit]\n\n\nThe electrical & electronics (E&E) industry is the leading sector in Malaysia's manufacturing sector, contributing significantly to the country's exports (32.8 per cent) and employment (27.2 per cent) in 2013. Malaysia benefits from the global demand in the usage of mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), storage devices (cloud computing, data centres), optoelectronics (photonics, fibre optics, LEDs) and embedded technology (integrated circuits, PCBs, LEDs).[101]\n\n\n\n#### Electronic components[edit]\n\n\nProducts/activities which fall under this sub-sector include semiconductor devices, passive components, printed circuits and other components such as media, substrates and connectors.\n\n\nWithin the electronic components sub-sector, the semiconductor devices is the leading contributor of exports for the E&E industry. Exports of semiconductor devices were RM111.19 billion or 47% of the total E&E products exported in 2013.\n\n\nMalaysia is a major hub for electrical component manufacturing, with factories of international companies like Intel, AMD, Freescale Semiconductor, ASE, Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, Fairchild Semiconductor, Renesas, X-Fab and major Malaysian-owned companies such as Green Packet, Silterra, Globetronics, Unisem and Inari which have contributed to the steady growth of the semiconductor industry in Malaysia. To date, there are more than 50 companies, largely MNCs producing semiconductors devices in Malaysia.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Photovoltaics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Photovoltaics manufacturing in Malaysia\nMalaysia is a major hub for solar equipment manufacturing, with factories of companies like First Solar, Panasonic, TS Solartech, Jinko Solar, JA Solar, SunPower, Hanwha Q Cells, and SunEdison in locations like Kulim, Penang, Malacca, Cyberjaya and Ipoh.[102][103]\n\n![](image)First Solar's factory in Kulim\nIn 2013, Malaysia's total production capacity for solar wafers, solar cells and solar panels totalled 4,042 MW.[104] By 2014, Malaysia was the world's third largest manufacturer of photovoltaics equipment, behind China and the European Union.[102]\n\n\nMany international companies have the majority of production capacity located in Malaysia, such as the American company First Solar which has over 2,000 MW of production capacity located in Kulim and only 280 MW located in Ohio,[105] and formerly German-based Hanwha Q Cells which produces 1,100 MW worth of solar cells in Cyberjaya while producing only 200 MW worth of solar cells in Germany. SunPower's largest manufacturing facility with a capacity of 1,400 MW is also located in Malacca.[102][106]\n\n\n\n### Automotive[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Proton Prevé, a car made by Malaysian car company Proton.\nSee also: Automotive industry in Malaysia\n\nThe automotive industry in Malaysia consists of 27 vehicle producers and over 640 component manufacturers.[107] The Malaysian automotive industry is the third largest in Southeast Asia, and the 23rd largest in the world, with an annual production output of over 500,000 vehicles.[108] The automotive industry contributes 4% or RM 40 billion to Malaysia's GDP, and employs a workforce of over 700,000 throughout a nationwide ecosystem.[107]\n\n\nThe Malaysian automotive industry is Southeast Asia's sole pioneer of indigenous car companies, namely Proton and Perodua. In 2002, Proton helped Malaysia become the 11th country in the world with the capability to fully design, engineer and manufacture cars from the ground up.[109] The Malaysian automotive industry also hosts several domestic-foreign joint venture companies, which assemble a large variety of vehicles from imported complete knock down (CKD) kits.\n\n\nMalaysia's first tech unicorn startup, automotive e-commerce platform Carsome, raised $290 million in a Series E funding round to expand its product, technology and infrastructure in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. This latest funding round values the used-car online marketplace at $1.7 billion.[110]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penang Bridge\nMalaysia has a large construction industry of over RM102.2 billion (US$32 billion). The highest percentage share was contributed by construction of non-residential buildings which recorded 34.6 per cent. This was followed by civil engineering sub-sector (30.6%), residential buildings (29.7%), and special trades (5.1%).[111]\n\n\nSelangor recorded the highest value of construction work done at 24.5% among the states, followed by Johor at 16.5%, Kuala Lumpur at 15.8%, Sarawak at 8.6% and Penang at 6.4%. The contribution of these five states accounted for 71.8% of the total value of construction work in Malaysia.\n\n\nThe expansion of the construction industry has been catalysed by major capital expenditure projects, and a key factor has been the government's Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) and public-private partnership (PPP) mega-projects like Tun Razak Exchange, KVMRT and Iskandar Malaysia.[111]\n\n\n\n### Defence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Kedah-class warship, with another unit being built in the background\nMalaysia has a relatively new defence industry that was created after the government created the Malaysia Defence Industry Council to encourage local companies to participate in the country's defence sector in 1999.\n\n\nThe land sector of the defence industry is dominated by DefTech, a subsidiary of Malaysia's largest automotive manufacturer, DRB-HICOM. The company focuses on manufacturing armoured vehicles and specialised logistics vehicles. The company has supplied ACV-15 infantry fighting vehicles to the Malaysian Army in the past and is currently supplying the DefTech AV8 amphibious multirole armoured vehicle to the Malaysian Army.\n\n\nThe sea sector of the defence industry is dominated by Boustead Heavy Industries, who builds warships for the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) through transfer of technology with foreign companies. The company has built 4 Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels for the RMN in the past and is currently undertaking a project to build 6 more Second Generation Patrol Vessels for the RMN.\n\n\n\n## Services sector[edit]\n\n\n### Finance and banking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of Maybank, Malaysia's largest bank\nKuala Lumpur has a large financial sector, and is ranked the 22nd in the world in the Global Financial Centres Index.[112]\nThere are currently 27 commercial banks (8 domestic and 19 foreign), 16 Islamic banks (10 domestic and 6 foreign), 15 investment banks (all domestic) and 2 other financial institutions (both domestic) operating in Malaysia.\n\n\nCommercial banks are the largest and most significant providers of funds in the banking system. The biggest banks in Malaysia's finance sector are Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank Berhad, RHB Bank and AmBank.\n\n\nMalaysia is currently also the world's largest centre of Islamic Finance. Malaysia has 16 fully-fledged Islamic banks including five foreign ones, with total Islamic bank assets of US$168.4 billion, which accounts for 25% of the Malaysia's total banking assets.[113] This in turn accounts for over 10% of the world's total Islamic banking assets. In comparison, Malaysia's main rival UAE, has US$95 billion of assets.[114]\n\n\nMalaysia is the global leader in terms of the sukuk (Islamic bond) market, issuing RM62 billion (US$17.74 billion)[115] worth of sukuk in 2014 - over 66.7%[116] of the global total of US$26.6 billion[113][117] Malaysia also accounts for around two-thirds of the global outstanding sukuk market, controlling $178 billion of $290 billion, the global total.[118]\n\n\nThe Malaysian government is planning to transform the country's capital Kuala Lumpur into a major financial centre in a bid to raise its profile and spark greater international trade and investment through the construction of the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX). The government believes the project will allow Malaysia to compete with regional financial superpowers such as Singapore and Hong Kong, by leveraging on the country's established strength in the rapidly growing Islamic financial marketplace.[113]\n\n\nBased in Kuala Lumpur, Bursa Malaysia serves as the country's sole national stock exchange. Trading of shares started in 1960 and it is today one of the largest bourses in Southeast Asia.[119][120]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Malaysia\n\n![](image)South Beach at Perhentian Besar\nTourism is a huge sector of the Malaysian economy, with over 57.1 million domestic tourists generating RM37.4 billion (US$11 billion) in tourist receipts in 2014,[121] and attracting 27,437,315 international tourist arrivals,[122] a growth of 6.7% compared to 2013. Total international tourist receipts increased by 3.9% to RM60.6 billion (US$19 billion) in 2014.[123]\n\n\nUnited Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) listed Malaysia as the 10th most visited country in 2012.[124]\n\n\nMalaysia is rich with diverse natural attractions which become an asset to the country's tourism industry. This was recognised by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), who declared Malaysia as \"a destination full of unrealized potential\" with the main strength as the availability of a vast range of diverse attractions to suit all tastes relatively affordable prices and; largely unspoilt destination.[125]\n\n\nMalaysia's top tourist destinations are the Mulu Caves, Perhentian Islands, Langkawi, Petronas Towers and Mount Kinabalu.[126]\n\n\n\n#### Medical tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Medical tourism in Malaysia\n\n![](image)Tuaran Hospital in Sabah\nMedical tourism is a significant sector of Malaysia's economy, with an estimated 1 million travelling to Malaysia specifically for medical treatments alone in 2014, contributing around US$200 million (about RM697 mil) in revenue to the economy.[127]\n\n\nMalaysia is reputed as one of the most preferred medical tourism destinations with modern private healthcare facilities and highly efficient medical professionals.[128] In 2014, Malaysia was ranked the world's best destination for medical tourism by the Nomad Capitalist.[129] Malaysia was also included in the top 10 medical tourism destinations list by CNBC.[130]\n\n\nIn 2014, Prince Court Medical Centre, a Malaysian hospital, was ranked the world's best hospital for medical tourists by MTQUA.[131]\n\n\nThe Malaysian government targets to hit RM 9.6 billion (US$3.2 billion) in revenue from 1.9 million foreign patients by 2020.[128]\n\n\n\n### Oil and gas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Petronas petrol station in Thailand\nMalaysia has a vibrant oil and gas industry. The national oil company, Petronas is ranked the 69th biggest company in the world in the Fortune 500 list in 2014, with a revenue of over US100.7 billion and total assets of over US$169 billion. Petronas provides around 30% of the Malaysian government's revenue, although the government has been actively cutting down on its reliance of petroleum, with a target of 20%.[132]\n\n\nPetronas is also the custodian of oil and gas reserves for Malaysia. Hence, all oil and gas activities are regulated by Petronas. Malaysia encourages foreign oil company participation through production sharing contracts, in which significant amount of oil will be given away to the foreign oil company until it reaches a production milestone. Currently, many major oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Nippon Oil, and Murphy Oil are involved in such contracts.[133] As a result, 40% of oil fields in Malaysia are developed.[134]\n\n\nThere are over 3,500 oil and gas (O&G) businesses in Malaysia comprising international oil companies, independents, services and manufacturing companies that support the needs of the O&G value chain both domestically and regionally. Many major global machinery & equipment (M&E) manufacturers have set up bases in Malaysia to complement home-grown M&E companies, while other Malaysian oil and gas companies are focused on key strategic segments such as marine, drilling, engineering, fabrication, offshore installation and operations and maintenance (O&M).\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nThe infrastructure of Malaysia is one of the most developed in Asia.[135][136] Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7 million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30 million cellular subscribers.(2011)[137][138] The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park.[101] Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as those in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.[139] The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.[137]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bakun Dam under construction in 2009\nSee also: Energy policy of Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional, List of power stations in Malaysia, and National Grid (Malaysia)\n\nMalaysia's energy infrastructure sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers are connected to electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000 km[140] of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts.\n\n\nIn 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh.[141]\n\n\nEnergy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.[142]\n\n\nMalaysia has also significant renewable energy resources and has high potential for the development of large-scale solar power and it has one of the most advanced legal frameworks in the ASEAN region for promoting renewables.[143] The country set a 20% target of renewable energy in its energy mix by 2025 and to achieve this the government will need to improve its renewable energy governance, investment policy and market entry for foreign investors as well to develop a framework for easier grid connection and use.[143] As of 2021, Malaysia is one of the major producers of solar panels for the international market, but paradoxically it has yet to fully capitalize on this for domestic electricity generation.[144]\n\n\n\n### Transport network[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Malaysia\n\n#### Road network[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North–South Expressway, the longest highway in Malaysia\nMalaysia's road network is one of the most comprehensive in Asia and covers a total of 144,403 kilometres (89,728 mi).\n\n\nThe main national road network is the Malaysian Federal Roads System, which span over 49,935 km (31,028 mi). Most of the federal roads in Malaysia are 2-lane roads. In town areas, federal roads may become 4-lane roads to increase traffic capacity. Nearly all federal roads are paved with tarmac except parts of the Skudai–Pontian Highway which is paved with concrete, while parts of the Federal Highway linking Klang to Kuala Lumpur, is paved with asphalt.\n\n\nMalaysia has over 1,798 kilometres (1,117 mi) of highways and the longest highway, the North–South Expressway, extends over 800 kilometres (497 mi) on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, connecting major urban centres like Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru. In 2015, the government announced a RM27 billion (US$8.23 billion) Pan-Borneo Highway project to upgrade all trunk roads to dual carriage expressways, bringing the standard of East Malaysian highways to the same level of quality of Peninsular highways.[145][146]\n\n\n\n#### Rail network[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Rail transport in Malaysia\n\nThere are currently 1,833 kilometres (1,139 mi) of railways in Malaysia, 767 km (477 mi) are double tracked and electrified.\n\n\nRail transport in Malaysia comprises heavy rail (KTM), light rapid transit and monorail (Rapid Rail), and a funicular railway line (Penang Hill Railway). Heavy rail is mostly used for intercity passenger and freight transport as well as some urban public transport, while LRTs are used for intra-city urban public transport. There two commuter rail services linking Kuala Lumpur with the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The sole monorail line in the country is also used for public transport in Kuala Lumpur, while the only funicular railway line is in Penang. A rapid transit project, the KVMRT, is currently under construction to improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system.\n\n\nThe railway network covers most of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia. In East Malaysia, only the state of Sabah has railways. The network is also connected to the Thai railway 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) network in the north. If the Burma Railway is rebuilt, services to Myanmar, India, and China could be initiated.\n\n\n\n#### Air network[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of airports in Malaysia, List of airlines of Malaysia, and List of the busiest airports in Malaysia\n\n![](image)Kuala Lumpur International Airport\nMalaysia has 118 airports, of which 38 are paved. The national airline is Malaysia Airlines, providing international and domestic air services. Major international routes and domestic routes crossing between West Malaysia and East Malaysia are served by Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia and Malindo Air while smaller domestic routes are supplemented by smaller airlines like MASwings, Firefly and Berjaya Air. Major cargo airlines include MASkargo and Transmile Air Services.\n\n\nKuala Lumpur International Airport is the main and busiest airport of Malaysia. In 2014, it was the world's 13th busiest airport by international passenger traffic, recording over 25.4 million international passenger traffic. It was also the world's 20th busiest airport by passenger traffic, recording over 48.9 million passengers.\n\n\nOther major airports include Kota Kinabalu International Airport, which is also Malaysia's second busiest airport and busiest airport in East Malaysia with over 6.9 million passengers in 2013, and Penang International Airport, with over 5.4 million passengers in 2013.\n\n\n\n#### Sea network[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Port Klang\nSee also: Transport in Malaysia § Waterways\n\nMalaysia is strategically located on the Strait of Malacca, one of the most important shipping lanes in the world.\n\n\nMalaysia has two ports that are listed in the top 20 busiest ports in the world, Port Klang and Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are respectively the 2nd and 3rd busiest ports in Southeast Asia after the Port of Singapore.\n\n\nPort Klang is Malaysia's busiest port, and the 13th busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 10.3 million TEUs. Port of Tanjung Pelepas is Malaysia's second busiest port, and the 19th busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 7.6 million TEUs.\n\n\n\n## Free trade efforts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Malaysia–United States Free Trade Agreement\n\n### International trade agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Kearney, a global management consulting firm, Malaysia was ranked 15th in the 2014 Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, 9th in 2012, 16th in 2007 and 21st in 2010.

According to the Asian Development Bank Institute, “before China implemented reform and opening-up policies in 1978, its income distribution pattern was characterized as egalitarian in all aspects.”[1]\n\n\nA study published in the PNAS estimated that China's Gini coefficient increased from 0.30 to 0.55 between 1980 and 2002.[2] At this time, the Gini coefficient for rural – urban inequality was only 0.16. As of 2019[update], the official Gini coefficient in China was 0.465; inequality was at its highest in the 2000s, with numerous sources reporting a significant decline in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn a landmark paper published in the *Review of Development Economics*, economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiaobo Zhang conclude that there have been three peaks of inequality in China in the last fifty years, “coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s.”[4] Their research indicates that these periods of inequality are driven by “three key policy variables – the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.”[4] The study finds that the “heavy-industry development strategy played a key role in forming the enormous rural-urban gap in the pre-reform period, while openness and decentralization contributed to the rapid increase in inland-coastal disparity in the reform period of the 1980s and 90s.” In other words, heavy industry development in the cities formed the initial rural-urban gap leading up to the reform period, and decentralization increased overall inequality, rural-urban inequality, and inland-coastal inequality as the economy opened up after the 1978 economic reforms.[4] Research conducted by Jeffrey Sachs on the entire period from 1952 to 1996 indicates that in general, regional income inequalities are driven by government policy, whereas income divergence is \"strongly associated with the extent of marketization and openness.\"[5]\n\n\n\n## Current state[edit]\n\n\nChina is a newly industrialized country and an emerging economy, with quarterly GDP growth rates averaging 9.31%[6] for the past two decades, powered mainly by strong exports. However, China still faces a number of socioeconomic issues, including the increasing income disparity between different groups of citizens, largely characterized by rural-urban income inequality. Despite steady growth of China's economy since economic reforms in 1978, the rural-urban income gap reached its widest in more than three decades in 2009.[7] According to data from National Bureau of Statistics of China, at its widest disparity, city dwellers were earning 3.33 times as much as farmers (income ratio of 3.33:1), with per capita disposable income of urban households standing at RMB17175 while per capita net income of rural households at RMB5153.[8] In contrast, the income disparity was at its narrowest in 1983, at 1.82:1, due to effects of the Household-responsibility system introduced in 1978.[9] As of year 2010, income ratio was recorded at 3.23:1 and per capita disposable income of urban households stood at RMB19109 while rural households’ were at RMB5919.[8] In 2014, according to an Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University, income inequality among Chinese mainland citizens has reached severe conditions, with 1% of the Chinese population possessing 1/3 of the country's wealth.[10] The existing high income inequality in China is primarily attributed to structural factors inherent in the Chinese political system, with the principal structural drivers being the urban-rural disparity and regional disparities in economic prosperity.[11]\n\n\nIn 2012, a report published by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics estimated the Gini index of China at 0.61[12]\n\n\nChina's government publishes an official yearly calculation of the country's Gini index. According to these reports, the average Gini coefficient between residents was .475 between the years of 2003 and 2018, reaching a high of 0.491 in 2008 and a low of 0.462 in 2015.[13] In 2019, China's official Gini coefficient was 0.465; various sources have debated the accuracy of this data, with the World Bank calculating 0.385 (2016) after factoring cheaper prices in rural areas while the World Inequality Database reporting higher numbers after factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments. However, it is generally agreed among sources that China's inequality decreased significantly in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n## Factors[edit]\n\n\n### Urban-biased policies[edit]\n\n\nMore than 10% of China's total inequality is attributed to the rural-urban gap, according to a study published in the PNAS.[2] Research conducted by Dennis Tao Yang published in the journal of the American Economic Association indicates that the root of China's rural-urban divide “lies in the strategy of the centrally planned system that favored heavy-industry development and extracted agricultural surplus largely for urban capital accumulation and urban-based subsidies.”[14] In the 1980s and 1990s, state investments in the rural economy accounted for “less than 10 percent of the budget, despite the fact that the rural population was about 73-76 percent of the national population.”[14] Additionally, factor market distortions have created significant rural-urban inequalities. More specifically, research published in the *Journal of Economic Modelling* demonstrates that the Hukou system and absence of a fully functioning land market are two main drivers of rural-urban inequality.[15]\n\n\n\n### Inland-coastal inequality[edit]\n\n\nAs is well documented in many studies, rural-urban inequality is a major contributing factor to general income inequality in China. However, “while the contribution of rural-urban inequality is much higher than that of inland-coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,” meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China.[16] A study found that variations across Chinese provinces account for about 12% of the country's overall income inequality.[17] Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled.[18] Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that \"since being a coastal province is a geographic advantage that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue,\" but institutional factors still have a significant effect.[5] Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the “greater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, compared to the institutional and other difficulties of migrating from inland to coastal provinces” can partially explain this phenomenon.[16] China's Hukou system (户口) is an institutional factor that significantly inhibits interprovincial migration. Recently, the government has introduced policies that relax Hukou related restrictions in small and medium-sized cities, in an effort to encourage growth.[19] “Currently rural incomes are less equally distributed than urban incomes but urban inequality is increasing faster than rural inequality” (Wu, 2005, p. 773).[20]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAccording to research conducted at the World Bank, “inequality of access to education is an important source of inequality in China across people contemporaneously and across generations.”[18] In fact, “a decomposition analysis based on household income determination shows that the largest proportion of changes in total income can be attributed to the increase in returns to education.”[18] Urban-biased policies and inland-coastal inequality exacerbates the issue of education inequality in China. One of the primary issues is their generation of sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing and education, which \"not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.\"[14] In other words, inland and rural inequality can help create a vicious cycle by funneling money towards the coastal cities and away from investments in human capital elsewhere. Like in the United States, education funding is primarily the responsibility of local governments in China. As poor localities are less able to fund these services and poor households are less able to afford the high private cost of basic education, China has seen an increase in the inequality of education outcomes. “For example, in 1998, per pupil expenditure in Beijing was 12 times that in Guizhou, and the difference jumped to 15 times in 2001.”[18]\n\n\n\n### Demographic Change[edit]\n\n\nAccording to research published in the China Economic Review, population aging is “largely responsible for the sharp increase in income inequality in rural China,” especially at the beginning of the 2000s.[21] As a result of Chinese governmental attempts to control population growth with the one-child policy implemented in 1979, many fewer young adults have reached the working age over the course of the past decade, leading to a significant “fall in the ratio of household members of working age.” This created a labor shortage, which in combination with the rapid expansion of industrialization served to increase income inequality.[21] Beyond income inequality, this research also indicates that “an imbalanced population structure will influence the social and economic development in many other respects.” The researchers recommend serious reconsideration of the one-child policy to mitigate these effects. Recently in 2019, measures to redact or modify the one-child policy have been reviewed and ratified to be put into place. Its ramifications and consequences yet to be seen.\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2009, a survey conducted by the *Economy and Nation Weekly* magazine of Xinhua news revealed that 34 out of the 50 leading Chinese economists surveyed think of income inequality as a challenge to China's sustainable development.[9] Economist Kenneth Rogoff also cautioned on the problem of income inequality, commenting that “There is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world, whether it is in the United States, the European periphery, or China.”[22] Income inequality is argued to be a menace to social stability, and potentially causes a disappearance of middle class capital that would impede China's economic growth.[23]\n\n\n“Hu Angang, an influential researcher in China, warned that further increases in regional disparities may lead to China’s dissolution, like in the former Yugoslavia,” while other scholars have noted that “further expansions of the differences may create serious social and political problems, generate nationalist conflicts and negatively influence China’s economic and social stability.”[16]\n“The current institutions and policies are detrimental to China’s future growth because the sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing, and education not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.”[14] In other words, current income inequality created largely as a result of government policy favoring urban centers begets further rural-urban income inequality, which creates a vicious cycle and further reinforces regional and rural-urban inequalities.\n\n\n\n## Policy recommendations[edit]\n\n\n### Economic reform[edit]\n\n\n Research published by the International Monetary Fund indicates that “continuing with the current growth pattern would further increase already high investment and saving needs to unsustainable levels, lower urban employment growth, and widen the rural-urban income gap.”[24] Instead, they recommend reducing subsidies to industry and investment, encouraging the development of the services industry, and reducing barriers to labor mobility, believing that this would result in a “more balanced growth with an investment-to-GDP ratio that is consistent with medium-term saving trends, faster growth in urban employment, and a substantial reduction in the income gap between rural and urban residents.”[24] With regard to labor mobility reform, research published in the journal of Economic Modelling suggests that reforms in the rural land rental market and Hukou system alongside efforts to increase off-farm labor mobility would dramatically reduce the urban-rural income ratio. Additionally, the research states that “the combination of WTO accession and factor market reforms improves both efficiency and equality significantly.”[15] WTO accession means that the economy will become more liberalized and open, “likely resulting in dramatic shifts in regional comparative advantages.”[4] This regional disparity will likely be exacerbated by continued government investment in coastal regions, so “further liberalizing and investing in the economy in the inland region is thus an important developmental strategy for the government to both promote economic growth and reduce regional inequality.”[4]\n\n\n\n### Social policy reform[edit]\n\n\nAnalysis of the impact of the one-child policy indicates that “population aging will impact society in multiple ways, and it is therefore crucial for policy makers to produce a development strategy that tackles the socio-economic challenges of an aging population.”[21] Some specific recommendations from the School of Public Finance and Public Policy of Beijing include “the establishment of a basic old age security system in rural areas” to reduce income inequality, encouragement of development of local industry in less affluent regions, subsidization of children's education in lower income households, and the establishment of public health insurance plans for the poor.” Additionally, the report finds that “In the long run, the Chinese government should reconsider whether the one-child policy should be continued. As an interim policy, it has achieved its objective, and now is the time for adjusting the policy.”[21]\n Research from the World Bank indicates that while inequality of income can be inevitable at certain stages of development, inequality of opportunity will undermine long-term development prospects. In order to enhance growth and fight poverty, it will therefore be important to improve access to basic education, especially in poor rural areas.[18]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy reform[edit]\n\n\nChina already has a tax and redistribution system. It is divided into 9 income groups. The first bracket for salaries exceeding 800 yuan (or US$96.4) is taxed at 5%, the last bracket for incomes exceeding 100,000 yuan (or US$12,000) is taxed at 45%. \nThere is also a tax system for craftsmen. This one is based on 5 tranches and not 9. The highest rate is 35%.[25]\nHowever, it seems that this tax system cannot really be effective in reducing inequalities. This is for several reasons. \nChina faces significant corruption problems that make this tax system illegitimate and difficult to enforce. Tax payers consider that the taxes they pay will go to a privileged minority, which is why, in practice, this tax system is not legitimate.[26]\n\n\nCorruption is already a major issue for China. According to a study, 50% of state-owned companies, 60% of joint venture companies and 100% of craftsmen practice tax evasion in China. In the 1980s, commercial and industrial evasion increased considerably to reach 100 billion yuan in 1989, or about 10% of national income. Income tax evasion reached 95%,[27] according to Ministry of Security sources between 1985 and 1988 there were 8900 cases of tax revolt, 1500 tax inspectors were injured, 872 were in critical condition, 28 were disabled, and 4 died. During the first six months of 1990, there were 1352 cases of tax revolts, 1047 tax inspectors injured, 127 critically ill and disabled, and 3 dead.[28] In 1992 and 1993, there were 2744 and 2967 violent events against payment of taxes respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Poverty in China\n* Economy of China\n* Education in China\n* Social issues in China\n* Income tax in China\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Kanbur, Ravi; Fan, Shenggen; Wei, Shang-Jin; Zhang, Xiaobo (2014). *The Oxford companion to the economics of China*.

In the first quarter of 2019, Saudi Arabia's budget had its first surplus since 2016. This surplus of $10.10 billion was achieved due to an increase in oil and non-oil revenues.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic overview[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027).

oil producer. Proven reserves, according to figures provided by the Saudi government, are estimated to be 260 billion barrels (41 km3), which is about one-quarter of the world oil reserves. Petroleum in Saudi Arabia is not only plentiful but also located under pressure close to the earth's surface, which makes it less expensive and more profitable to extract compared to other places.[23] The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 87% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 42% of GDP.[24] Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and production are largely managed by the state-owned corporation Saudi Aramco.[25]\n\n\nAnother 40% of the GDP comes from the private sector. An estimated 7.5 (2013) million foreigners work legally in Saudi Arabia[26] and play a crucial role in developing the Saudi economy, for example in the oil and service sectors. The government has been encouraging the growth of the private sector for many years to decrease the kingdom's dependence on oil and to increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. In recent decades, the government started allowing private sector activity and foreign investor participation in certain sectors, such as power generation and telecommunications, and acceded to the World Trade Organization. During much of the 2000s, high oil prices[27] allowed the government to post budget surpluses and boost spending on job training and education, infrastructure development, and government salaries.\n\n\nWith its absolute monarchy, large state sector, and supply of welfare benefits, the Saudi economy has been described asː\n\n\n\n\n>  A bewildering (at least to outsiders) combination of a feudal fealty system and a more modern political patronage one. At every level in every sphere of activity, Saudis maneuver through life manipulating individual privileges, favours, obligations, and connections. By the same token, the government bureaucracy is a maze of overlapping or conflicting power centers under the patronage of various royal princes with their own priorities and agendas to pursue and dependents to satisfy.[28]\n> \n> \n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia\n\n![](image)Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938, the day the well struck oil in commercial quantities, becoming the first in the kingdom to do so\nSaudi Arabia was a subsistence economy until the 1930s. In 1933, the Saudi government signed an oil concession agreement with the Standard Oil Company of California;[29] five years later, commercial volumes of oil were discovered in the kingdom.[30][31] The development of oil fields continued in Saudi Arabia, managed mainly by Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), a company formed by the partnership of Texaco and Chevron.[32] In 1951, the first offshore field in the Middle East was established by Aramco at Raʾs Al-Saffāniyyah area.[33] By 1949, Saudi oil production reached 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and rose rapidly to 1 million bpd in 1954.[34][35] Moreover, in 1951, Aramco started operating the Trans-Arabian Pipeline that moved oil from the eastern region of Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea through Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. However, in 1981, this line was no longer used after a new line began operations that linked Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea. The new pipe contributed greatly to speed up oil transport.[33] In 1960, OPEC was established, with Saudi Arabia as one of its founding members.[36] During the 1973 oil crisis, the price of oil rose from $3 per barrel to nearly $12, and the Saudi economy started growing rapidly,[37] with GDP increasing from approximately $15 billion in 1973 to almost $184 billion by 1981.[38] After gradually purchasing Aramco assets, the Saudi government nationalized the company in 1980. In 1988, Saudi Aramco was established to take over the responsibilities of Aramco.[39]\n\n\nIn 1980, the price of oil peaked, and demand started decreasing as a result of recessions in industrialized nations and more efficient oil use, which produced surpluses.[40] This created a worldwide oil glut, with the price of oil dropping from approximately $36 per barrel in 1980 to approximately $14 by 1986.[41] Saudi oil production, which had increased to almost 10 million barrels (1,600,000 m3) per day during 1980–81, fell 80% to about 2 million barrels per day (320,000 m3/d) in 1985.[42] Budgetary deficits developed, and the government drew down its foreign assets.[43] As a result of the oil glut and the pressure from declines in production, after 1985 Saudi Arabia started enforcing production quotas more harshly for the OPEC members.[44]\n\n\nIn June 1993, Saudi Aramco absorbed the state marketing and refining company (SAMAREC), becoming the world's largest fully integrated oil company. Most Saudi oil is exported by tankers from oil terminals at Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah in the Persian Gulf. The remaining oil for export is transported via the east–west pipeline across the kingdom to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. A major new gas initiative was supposed to attract significant investments from the American and European oil companies to develop non-associated gas fields in three separate parts of Saudi Arabia. Following final technical agreements with concession awardees in December 2001, development was expected to begin in 2002.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013\nIn the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in 1998.[45] Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the kingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010.[46] Increases in oil prices in the early 2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400 adjusted for inflation),[47] but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.[48]\n\n\nHowever, beginning in late 1997, Saudi Arabia again faced the challenge of low oil prices. Because of a combination of factors—the East Asian economic crises, a warm winter in the West caused by El Niño, and an increase in non-OPEC oil production—demand for oil decreased and pulled oil prices down by more than one-third.[49]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia was a key player in coordinating the successful 1999 campaign of OPEC and other oil-producing countries to raise the oil price to its highest level since the (Persian) Gulf War by managing petroleum supply and production. That same year, Saudi Arabia established the Supreme Economic Council to formulate and better coordinate economic development policies to accelerate institutional and industrial reforms.[50]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005 after many years of negotiations.\n\n\n\n### Foreign investment[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2000, there were strict limits placed on foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. The 1979 Foreign Investment Act prohibited foreign ownership in some sectors of the economy, allowed foreign investment only if the investor qualified for a license based on their expertise, and gave priority to businesses that were Saudi-owned or partially Saudi-owned.[51]\n\n\nHowever, in the mid-1990s, foreign ownership rules were relaxed, with investment sought in telecommunications, utilities, and financial services.[52] The 2000 Foreign Direct Investment Act made substantial changes to the rules on foreign investment, including allowing projects to be run by 100% foreign-owned companies for the first time.[51]\n\n\nSince 2008, extensive Saudi land investment has taken place, especially in Africa. For more, see the section on the Non-petroleum sector.\n\n\nAccording to UNCTAD's June 2018 report, Saudi Arabia's foreign direct investment was only $1.4 billion in 2017, down from $7.5 billion the year before and as much as $12.2 billion in 2012. The fall in investment is attributed to negative intra-company loans by foreign multinationals and various divestments.[53] In the first quarter of 2018, net capital outflows were running at approximately 5% of GDP, compared to less than 2% of GDP in late 2016.[54] However, according to a report published in Trading Economics, in the second quarter of 2018, foreign direct investment in the country raised by $882 million.[55] Moreover, SAGIA's data indicate that licenses provided to foreign investment increased by 130% in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of reforms in the economy.[56]\n\n\nAs Saudi oil income declined in the late 2010s, the kingdom's international debt soared. In December 2018, Saudi Arabia announced it would be issuing bonds worth approximately 120 billion riyals ($32 billion) to cover its 4.2% GDP deficit of 131 billion riyals.[57] In January 2019, the kingdom sold bonds worth $7.5 billion.[58] In almost two and a half years, bonds worth $60 billion were sold by Saudi, which became one of the biggest borrowers globally.[59]\n\n\nIn September 2018, the Public Investment Fund completed a deal with a group of global lenders for a loan of $11 billion.[60] The deal raised more than initially planned and was the first time the PIF had incorporated loans and debt instruments into its funding.[61] According to data from Fitch Ratings, over two years starting from May 2016 Saudi Arabia went from having zero debt to raising $68 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and syndicated loans—one of the fastest rates among emerging economies.[62]\n\n\nForeign investments in the kingdom witnessed a rapid increase in the first quarter of 2019. The number of new licenses approved for foreign businesses grew 70% over 2018. Most licenses were approved for British and Chinese companies, which drove the increase.[63] In the first quarter of 2019, foreign investment in Saudi Arabia jumped by 28%.[20]\n\n\n\n### Diversification and the development plans[edit]\n\n\nThe government has sought to allocate its petroleum income to transform its relatively undeveloped, oil-based economy into a modern industrial state, while maintaining the kingdom's traditional Islamic values and customs. Although economic planners have not achieved all their goals, the economy has progressed rapidly. Oil wealth has increased the standard of living of most Saudis. However, significant population growth has strained the government's ability to finance further improvements in the country's standard of living. Heavy dependence on petroleum revenue continues, but industry and agriculture now account for a larger share of economic activity. The mismatch between the job skills of Saudi graduates and the needs of the private job market at all levels remains the principal obstacle to economic diversification and development; about 4.6 million non-Saudis are employed in the economy.[64]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia first began to diversify its economy to reduce dependency on oil in the 1970s as part of its first five-year development plan. Basic petrochemical industries using petroleum byproducts as feedstock were developed.[65] The fishing villages of al-Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea were developed. However, their effect on Saudi Arabia's economic fortunes has been small.[66]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's first two development plans, covering the 1970s, emphasized infrastructure. The results were impressive—the total length of paved highways tripled, power generation increased by a factor of 28, and the capacity of the seaports grew by a factor of 10. For the third plan (1980–85), the emphasis changed. Spending on infrastructure declined, shifting instead to education, health, and social services. The share for diversifying and expanding productive sectors of the economy (primary industry) did not rise as planned, but the two industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu—which were built around the use of the country's oil and gas to produce steel, petrochemicals, fertilizer, and refined oil products—were largely completed.[64]\n\n\nIn the fourth plan (1985–90), the country's basic infrastructure was viewed as largely complete, but education and training remained areas of concern. Private enterprise was encouraged, and foreign investment in the form of joint ventures with Saudi public and private companies was welcomed. The private sector became more important, rising to 70% of non-oil GDP by 1987. While still concentrated in trade and commerce, private investment increased in industry, agriculture, banking, and construction companies. These private investments were supported by generous government financing and incentive programs. The objective was for the private sector to have 70% to 90% ownership in most joint venture enterprises.[64]\n\n\nThe fifth plan (1990–95) emphasized consolidation of the country's defences; improved and more efficient government social services; regional development; and, most importantly, creating greater private-sector employment opportunities for Saudis by reducing the number of foreign workers.[64]\n\n\nThe sixth plan (1996–2000) focused on lowering the cost of government services without cutting them and sought to expand educational training programs. The plan called for reducing the kingdom's dependence on the petroleum sector by diversifying economic activity, particularly in the private sector, with special emphasis on industry and agriculture. It also continued the effort to \"Saudize\" the labour force.[64]\n\n\nThe seventh plan (2000–2004) focused more on economic diversification and a greater role of the private sector in the Saudi economy. For 2000–04, the government aimed at an average GDP growth rate of 3.16% each year, with projected growths of 5.04% for the private sector and 4.01% for the non-oil sector. The government also set a target of creating 817,300 new jobs for Saudi nationals.[64] By 2007, advertising expenditures had reached new peaks due to emphasis on value-added manufacturing.[67][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn 2016, the main investing countries in Saudi Arabia were the US, UAE, France, Singapore, Kuwait, and Malaysia. They mainly invested in chemical industry, real estate, tourism, fossil fuels, automobiles, and machinery.[68] As part of its diversification, Saudi Arabia arranged major refinery contracts with Chinese and other companies.[69]\n\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005, the overall foreign investment environment in Saudi Arabia improved thanks to the kingdom's stable economy, massive oil reserves, high power of expenditure, developed infrastructure, reinforced finance, and banking system. Since then, and pursuant to its commitment to the WTO, Saudi Arabia has been developing trade-related policies and legislations. Moreover, foreign investment has been highly encouraged by Saudi Vision 2030 and its economic diversification.[68]\n\n\nSince 2017, to boost the economy and decrease the country's dependency on oil, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced multiple changes, such as raising the prices of gasoline and electricity, levying new taxes, and prioritizing Saudi workers over foreign workers. However, some government officials claimed the policies were causing serious ill effects on the economy. Saudi businessmen reported a decline in sales for 2018, and a few blamed the government.[70]\n\n\nIn 2019, the *Financial Times* reported that the plans to float state-owned oil beneficiary Saudi Aramco were stranded between the company's attachment to the oil ministry and the desire to meet international standards. However, Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih has long maintained that Aramco's association with the state is a \"win-win policy\" for both parties.[71]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has announced plans to invest about $47 billion in three of the world's largest and most ambitious petrochemical projects. These include the $27 billion Ras Tanura integrated refinery and petrochemical project, the $9 billion Saudi Kayan[72] petrochemical complex at Jubail Industrial City, and the $10 billion Petro Rabigh refinery upgrade project. Together, the three projects will employ more than 150,000 technicians and engineers.[73] Upon completion in 2015–16, the Ras Tanura project would become the world's largest petrochemical facility of its kind with a combined production capacity of 11 million tons per year of different petrochemical and chemical products.[*needs update?*] The products will include ethylene, propylene, aromatics, polyethylene, ethylene oxide, chlorine derivatives, and glycol.[73]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia made plans to launch six \"economic cities\" (e.g., King Abdullah Economic City) in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs.[74] At a total construction cost of $60 billion (2013), they were \"expected to contribute $150bn to the economy\".[75]\n[76] However, these cities have failed to attract either the population or the financial investment that the government claimed they would.[77]\n\n\nThe privatization program Saudi Vision 2030 is running behind schedule. Oil prices have doubled since the government began to consider the program in 2015. Delay in Aramco's initial public offering further demonstrated a lack of urgency to privatize, even though in July 2018, the International Monetary Fund urged accelerating the process.[78]\n\n\nAs Vision 2030 has been recently adopted by the Saudi government, several reforms[*which?*] have been undertaken, including in business environments and the financial sector. Moreover, the government has been seeking to achieve greater transparency by issuing a draft law regarding the involvement of the private sector. Other reforms have been passed to increase manpower in the private sector.[79]\n\n\nAccording to many reports, the Saudi government is interested in granting more liberties to the foreign investment system and giving a 100% allowance to foreign investors to work in the wholesale and retail sector in certain cases.[68]\n\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Commerce and Investment expected that the kingdom would see an increase in the GDP per capita from US$20,700 to $33,500 by 2020.[80] However, the GDP per capita by 2020 had stagnated at $US20,000.[81]\n\n\n\n## Employment[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Saudization and Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia\n\nAs of 2008, roughly two-thirds of workers employed in Saudi Arabia were foreigners, and in the private sector the proportion was approximately 90%.[82] In January 2014, the Saudi government claimed it had lowered the 90% rate, doubling the number of Saudi citizens working in the private sector to 1.5 million (compared to 10 million foreign expatriates working in the kingdom).[83]\n\n\nAccording to Reuters, economists \"estimate only 30–40 percent of working-age Saudis hold jobs or actively seek work\", although the official unemployment rate is only around 12 percent. Most Saudis with jobs are employed by the government, but the International Monetary Fund has warned that the government cannot support such a large payroll in the long term.[83][84] The government has announced a succession of plans since 2000 to deal with the imbalance by \"Saudization\" of the economy, but the foreign workforce and unemployment has continued to grow.[85] Since the beginning of 2017, however, Saudi Arabia has seen record numbers of foreign workers leaving the country as the Saudi government imposed higher fees on expatriate workers, with more than 677,000 foreigners leaving the kingdom. This has done little to lower the unemployment rate, which rose to 12.9 percent, the highest on record.[86]\n\n\nEach year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With the first phase of Saudization into effect, 70% of sales jobs are expected to be filled by Saudis. However, the private sector still remains hugely dominated by foreigners. The rate of local unemployment is 12.9%, its highest in more than a decade.[87] According to a report published by Bloomberg Economics in 2018, the government needs to produce 700000 jobs by 2020 to meet its 9% unemployment target.[87]\n\n\nOne obstacle is social resistance to certain types of employment. Jobs in service and sales are considered totally unacceptable for citizens of Saudi Arabia—both to potential employees and customers.[88]\n\n\n\n## Non-petroleum resources sector[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has natural resources other than oil, including small mineral deposits of gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, manganese, tungsten, lead, sulfur, phosphate, soapstone, and feldspar.[66] The country has a small agricultural sector, primarily in the southwest where annual rainfall averages 400 mm (16 in). The country is one of the world's largest producers of dates. Prior to 2009, wheat was grown using desalinated water for irrigation,[66] but was phased out by 2016 due to costly water usage.[89] As of 2009, the livestock population amounted to 7.4 million sheep, 4.2 million goats, half a million camels, and a quarter of a million cattle.[66]\n\n\nAlthough the jobs created by the roughly two million annual Hajj pilgrims do not last long, they employ more people than the oil industry—40,000 temporary jobs (butchers, barbers, coach drivers, etc.)—and generates US$2–3 billion in revenue.[90]\n\n\nIn 2008, the \"Initiative for Saudi Agricultural Investment Abroad\" was launched, leading to extensive billion-dollar purchases of large tracts of land around the world, including in Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mali, Senegal, and Sudan. Described as land-grabbing by critics, in various instances these purchases have also led to uproars in the respective countries. Competing industrializing nations with food security problems seeking agricultural land include China, South Korea, and India, as well as the Persian Gulf States of Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE.[91][92][93][94][95]\n\n\nIn 2016, Mohammad bin Salman announced Saudi Vision 2030, a plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism.\n\n\n\n## Real estate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Residential homes in Yanbu\nOne of the fastest growing sectors in the country is real estate, supported by the introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITs). Despite significant growth in the number of REITs,[96][97] the sector has yet to achieve its full potential due to shortages in both residential and commercial real estate. A number of regional experts[*who?*] believe that most issues will be resolved as the market becomes more mature.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nReal estate plays a fundamental role in the country's non-oil economy. In 2016, the value of real estate transactions including sales of existing units amounted to $74.91 billion from 15 October to 16 September.[98] This is a major drop compared to the number of transactions recorded a decade earlier, which reached $239.93 billion. The real estate sector has been driven recently by strong local demand fundamentals and only a small amount of speculation.\n\n\nOwnership of land property in Saudi Arabia is generally restricted to Saudis, but this is subject to certain qualifications. For example, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nationals and GCC companies have certain rights to own land, subject to a number of restrictions.[99] Foreigners (being non-GCC nationals) are entitled to ownership and investment in real estate with some conditions. A foreign company needs to have a foreign investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) and the owned real estate must be related to a particular investment project for property development.[100] A foreign individual needs to have normal legal residency status and a permit from the Ministry of the Interior to own land or property.[100]\n\n\nThe major expansion in this sector attracted the top real estate consultancies—such as Jones Lang LaSalle,[101] Knight Frank,[102] and Cluttons[103]—who have now opened offices in the country. Beyond this, demand for professional real estate services is attracting regional educators such as DREI to provide courses on Saudi real estate, and even dedicated books focused on the market, such as *Saudi Real Estate Companion*.\n\n\nReal estate plays an important role in the Saudi Vision 2030, which maps out significant commitments by the Saudi government relating to housing and the development of land for a variety of uses. In particular, Vision 2030 states: \"Where it exists in strategic locations, we will also capitalize on the government's reserves of real estate. We will allocate prime areas within cities for educational institutions, retail, and entertainment centers, large areas along our coasts will be dedicated to tourist projects and appropriate lands will be allocated for industrial projects.\"[104]\n\n\nIn 2016, new rules were introduced by the Capital Market Authority to form REITs. This aimed at opening the real estate market to a wide range of investors.[99][97] The REITs consist of units representing the ownership of the underlying real estate. These units are offered to the public and traded on the Saudi Stock Exchange.[99][105]\n\n\nThe introduction of REITs was a part of the National Transformation program, one of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 programs, and has targets of:\n\n\n\n* Increasing the real estate sector contribution from GDP of five percent to 10 percent annually.[99]\n* Supporting the construction of 1.5 million homes by providing the required private capital.[99]\n* Establishing partnerships with private sector developers to develop government land for housing projects.\n* Establishing fast-track licenses and special finance packages to encourage private sector investment in housing projects.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Saudi government introduced the Premium Residency scheme, which allows wealthy investors of any nationality to purchase residency and buy and sell real estate.[106]\n\n\n\n## Automotive[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSU Gazal-1\nIn 2010, the KSU Gazal-1, an SUV built by students at King Saud University, became the first mass-produced vehicle manufactured domestically in Saudi Arabia.[107]\n\n\nIn 2022, the US car company Lucid Motors announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Jeddah.[108] Construction began in May 2022, and the plant will have capacity for 150,000 vehicles.[109]\n\n\nToyota is the leading brand in Saudi Arabia, accounting for 30% of car sales in the country; they are followed by Kia and Hyundai who together make up 26%, and Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi at 9%. The American Big Three auto makers (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) comprise the remainder.[110] As for the quantity of vehicle units sold, in the first half of 2023, Toyota had the highest in the country with 112,584 and the second-most was the Hyundai badge with 47,218.[111]\n\n\n\n## Private sector[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's private sector is dominated by a handful of big businesses in the service sector, primarily in construction and real estate, such as Olayan, Zamil, Almarai, Mobily, STC, SABIC, Sadara, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Flynas, Hilton, Zain, Yanbu Cement, Alhokair, MBC, Mahfouz, Al Rajhi, and Alfanar. These firms are \"heavily dependent on government spending\", which is dependent on oil revenues.[112]\n\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, \"several key services\" were privatized—municipal water supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health care, traffic control, and car accident reporting were also privatized. According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, \"in almost every one of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the performance of these privatized entities.\"[113]\n\n\nA relatively small sector until a boom in the 1980s,[114] the food service industry in Saudi Arabia today is valued at around $13 billion.[115]\n\n\nTo provide the best support for the private sector and entrepreneurs, the kingdom announced a decision approved by the Saudi Cabinet in July 2019 allowing businesses in the country to be given the option to remain open 24 hours a day.[116] As of 2023, the average monthly salary for Saudis working in the private sector is SR9600, up 45% from SR6600 in the year 2018.[117]\n\n\n\n## Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saudi Arabian exports in 2006\nIn April 2000, the government established the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia maintains a negative list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government planned to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.[118]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia became a full World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 11 December 2005.[119] In 2019, the government established the General Authority for Foreign Trade to enhance the kingdom's international commercial and investment activities.[120]\n\n\nIn early July 2020, Saudi Arabia announced the nomination of its former Minister of Economy and Saudi royal court adviser, Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri, for the role of WTO's director-general.[121] The nominations were made public about a month after the WTO reported the kingdom for copyrights infringement following distribution of pirated sports broadcasting content on the state-owned broadcast service, BeoutQ.[122] The nomination of al-Tuwaijri received criticism from human rights groups in mid-August 2020, demanding the rejection of the Saudi nominee due to the kingdom's violation of human rights in addition to his silence over it.[123] On 7 October 2020, Al-Tuwaijri, along with other nominees from the UK and Kenya, lost the bid for the role due to lack of support, as compared to the nominees from Nigeria and South Korea who qualified for the final round of selection.[124]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is part of the following trade organizations:\n\n\n\n* World Trade Organization (WTO)[119]\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF)[125]\n* International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)[126]\n* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)[127]\n* World Customs Organization (WCO)[128]\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nAmong the challenges to the Saudi economy include halting or reversing the decline in per capita income, improving education to prepare youth for the workforce and providing them with employment, diversifying the economy, stimulating the private sector and housing construction, and diminishing corruption and inequality. In answer to the question of why the Saudi economy is so dependent on foreign labor, the UN Arab Human Development Report blamed stunted social and economic development inhibited by lack of personal freedom, poor education, government hiring based on factors other than merit, and the exclusion of women.[129]\n\n\n\n### Income drop[edit]\n\n\nDespite possessing the second largest petroleum reserves in the world, per capita income dropped from approximately $18,000 at the height of the oil boom (1981) to $7,000 in 2001, according to one estimate.[130] As of 2013, due to the rapid population growth of Saudi Arabia,[131] per capita income in Saudi was \"a fraction of that of smaller Persian gulf neighbors\", even less than petroleum-poor Bahrain.[132]\n\n\nUnlike most developed countries, where GDP growth is a function of increases in productivity and inputs such as employment, in Saudi Arabia the fluctuation of oil prices is the most important factor in the growth or decline of domestic production. \"Saudi reserves are steadily being depleted, and no significant new discoveries have been found to replace them,\" according to Middle East journalist Karen House.[*as of?*] Saudi population grew sevenfold from 1960 to 2010,[133] and petrol prices are subsidized and cost users less than equivalent quantities of bottled water.[134] With production stagnant, growth in population and domestic energy consumption means a decline in per capita income unless oil prices rise to match that growth.[132]\n\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Demographics of Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Saudi population is young. About 51% of the total population are under the age of 25 (as of February 2012).[135] According to a 2013 report by the International Monetary Fund, up to 1.6 million young nationals of the Persian Gulf countries (of which Saudi Arabia is the largest) will enter the workforce from 2013 to 2018, but the economies of those countries will have jobs in the private sector for less than half (approximately 600,000).[136]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Saudi Arabia\n\nAccording to *The Economist*, the Saudi government has attempted in past years to raise employment by forcing \"companies to fill at least 30% of their positions\" with Saudi citizens. However, \"employers complained bitterly about the lack of skills among young locals; years of rote-learning and religious instruction fail to prepare them for the job market.\" However, many argue that young Saudis couldn't compete with foreigners due to the low compensation and salaries most companies had used to offer for employees from Asian, Indian subcontinent, and other Arab poor countries, which this cheap labor happily accepts; in addition to the bad work conditions, culture, and environment present in most of the Saudi private sector, largely due to the fact that it was initially modeled to accommodate very-low-income employees from other nations, not the Saudi medium-income and somewhat highly educated population. As a consequence, \"the quota has now been dropped and replaced with a more flexible system\".[137]\n\n\nAccording to scholar David Commins, the kingdom depends \"on huge numbers of expatriate workers to fill technical and administrative positions\" in part because of an educational system that, despite \"generous budgets\", has suffered from \"poorly trained teachers, low retention rates, lack of rigorous standards, weak scientific and technical instruction and excessive attention to religious subjects\".[138][139][140]\n\n\nA 2015 survey conducted by Bayt.com showed that over a quarter (28%) of professionals in North Africa and the Middle East believe that there is a skills shortage in their country of residence. This belief was even more prominent among respondents in Saudi Arabia (39%).[141]\n\n\n\n### Innovation[edit]\n\n\nSaudi has not been a hotbed of technological innovation. The number of Saudi patents registered in the United States between 1977 and 2010 came to 382—less than twelve per year—compared to 84,840 patents for South Korea or 20,620 for Israel during that period.[142][143] However, in 2017 Saudi Arabia was granted 664 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, ranking 23rd among 92 countries.[144][145] The number of granted patents was double that of all Arab countries combined during the same period.[146] Saudi Arabia hopes to increase technological innovation, particularly with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, and thus to stimulate the economy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bureaucracy[edit]\n\n\nBusiness journalist Karen House criticized the Saudi bureaucracy, explaining that someone seeking to start a business in Saudi Arabia:\n\n\n\n\n> has to complete innumerable applications and documents at multiple layers of multiple ministries, which invariably requires seeking favours from various patronage networks and accumulating obligations along the way, most probably including having to hire less-than-competent dependents of his patrons. Then, for any business of any size, government contracts, not private competition, are the financial lifeblood. So this means more patrons, more favours, and more obligations. Not surprisingly, Saudi businesses that can compete outside the protected Saudi market are few.[147]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Corruption[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Corruption in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe cost of maintaining the Royal Family is estimated by some to be about US$10 billion per year.[66]\n\n\nA 2005 survey by the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce found that 77% of businessmen polled felt they had to 'bypass' the law to conduct their operations. By 2012, \"businessmen say it has only gotten worse\".[148]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been severely criticized for failing to tackle money laundering and international terrorism financing. A report released by the Financial Action Task Force on 24 September 2018, says, \"Saudi Arabia is not effectively investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale or professional [money laundering] activity\" and is \"not effectively confiscating the proceeds of crime\".[149]\n\n\n\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nEstimates of the number of Saudis below the poverty line range from between 12.7%[150] and 25%.[151] Press reports and private estimates as of 2013 \"suggest that between 2 million and 4 million\" of the country's native Saudis live on \"less than about $530 a month\" – about $17 a day – considered the poverty line in Saudi Arabia.[151][152]\n\n\nThe Saudi state discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty. In December 2011, days after the Arab Spring uprisings, the Saudi interior ministry detained reporter Feros Boqna and two colleagues (Hussam al-Drewesh and Khaled al-Rasheed) and held them for almost two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a 10-minute video on the topic (*Mal3ob 3alena*, or 'We are being cheated') to YouTube.[153][154] Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis are considered to be poor (2009) and 70% of Saudis do not own their houses.[155] \nStatistics on the issue are not available through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue poverty figures.[156] Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous[157] because of the risk of being arrested, like Feras Boqna.[154][158]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n50% of Saudi Arabia's citizens owned their own home in 2017, a rise from 30% in 2011 but below the international average rate of 70%.[159] In 2011, analysts estimated 500,000 new homes per year were needed to match the growth in Saudi population, but as of early 2014 only 300,000 to 400,000 houses per year were being built.[160]\n\n\nOne problem is that the government Real Estate Development Fund (REDF)—which provides 81% of all loans for housing—had an 18-year waiting list for loans due to pent-up demand. Another is that the REDF's maximum loan is 500,000 SR ($133,000), while in 2012 the average price for a small free-standing home in Riyadh is more than double that—1.23 million SR ($328,000).[161] However, as part of the economic reforms undertaken by the government to enhance national living standards, new funding solutions have been established to boost the mortgages for existing and new borrowers to help finance their housing plans. This was announced in August 2018 by the Minister of Housing, Mr. Majed Al-Hogail.[162]\n\n\nA major reason for the high cost of housing is the high cost of land. In urban areas, the price of land has been bid up because nearly all of it is owned by the Saudi elite (members of the royal family or other wealthy Saudis), who have lobbied the government for land \"giveaways\".[160] Landlords have seen prices rocket by 50% from 2011 to 2013.[160] The owners benefit from these price increases as they hold the land for future development.[163][164] To deal with the key \"land banking\" issue, the Minister of Housing suggested in 2013 that vacant property within city limits could be subject to a tax. However, no firm plans for any tax have been unveiled.[160]\n\n\n\n### Further diversification[edit]\n\n\nAccording to journalist Karen House, \"every\" Saudi five-year plan \"since the first one in 1970\" has called for diversifying the economy beyond oil, but with marginal success.[165]\n\n\nAs of 2007, manufacturing outside of the petroleum industry contributed 10% to Saudi Arabian GDP and less than 6% of total employment.[166]\n\n\n\n### Private sector growth[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, the imposition of a 5% value-added tax (VAT) brought private-sector growth to a halt. Consumer spending was also restrained after a sharp increase in prices for energy, electricity, and water earlier in 2018. The kingdom witnessed a mass departure of around 750,000 foreign workers after imposing new government levies on ex-pat workers. The government is also forcing small-business owners to hire Saudi nationals at comparatively higher wages than foreign workers. Gaining money from large, direct foreign investments is also not working in favor of the government. Rich Saudis are reluctant to invest within the kingdom due to the fear of triggering government scrutiny.[167]\n\n\nOn 11 May 2020, the government announced that it would triple the kingdom's VAT on goods and services, raising it from 5% to 15%.[168] It also stated that the increase in VAT—introduced due to the country's current financial crisis due to plummeting oil prices and impact of coronavirus—would also be followed by a cut in monthly allowance for state workers worth approximately $266, and financial benefits for contractors.[169] \nAramco decreased the production of its Arab Light grade of crude oil by a significant amount[*by how much?*] to be shipped to Asia. The firm also cut down oil pricing for its US buyers following wavering demand for fuel due to the global relapse of the coronavirus pandemic.[170]\n\n\nAccording to the General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Arabia's inflation accelerated to 6.2% in August 2020, as compared to the same month last year. The report states that the annual inflation rate increased from only 0.5% (in June) to 6.1% (in July), before the increase of VAT to 15% from 5% was introduced, effective from 1 July 2020.[171]\n\n\n\n## Investment[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has two stock exchanges, the Tadawul and The Saudi Parallel Market (Nomu), whose financial markets are regulated by the Capital Market Authority.[172][173] The stock market capitalization of listed companies in Saudi Arabia is valued at $2.22 trillion. According to the International Institute for Management Development, Saudi Arabia experienced the largest improvement in business competitiveness of all countries in 2019; the kingdom rose 13 places to 26th in the world.[174]\n\n\n\n### Doing business[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is among the countries with the most notable improvement in doing business, according to the World Bank Group's \"Doing Business\" 2020 report. The country jumped 30 places to rank 62nd in ease of doing business, compared to the previous year.[175][176][177] Previously, the kingdom had been declining in the overall rankings, from 22nd in 2013[178] to 92nd in 2018.[179]\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank in 2019, Saudi Arabia had conducted reforms in eight areas of business: (1) starting a business, (2) getting construction permits, (3) getting electricity, (4) getting credit, (5) protecting minority investors, (6) trading across borders, (7) enforcing contracts, and (8) resolving insolvency.[176]\n\n\nSaudi Arabian companies dominate 2009's \"MEED 100\", with companies listed on the Tadawul accounting for 29 out of the region's 100 biggest publicly quoted companies ranked by market capitalization. Just three of the 20 companies that have dropped out of the top 100 over the past year are listed on the Saudi stock exchange.[180]\n\n\nForeigners are allowed to wholly own limited liability companies in the majority of industries. Non-Saudi nationals are required to obtain a foreign capital investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority.[181]\n\n\nWith a total of 291 foreign investor licenses issued in the second quarter of 2019, the kingdom has witnessed an increase in international investment, reflecting the economic reforms under the Saudi Vision 2030. Obtaining a foreign investor license became more straightforward as it requires only two documents, and it is processed in three hours.[182]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSharmarke Gaani, a Somali businessman, travelled to Saudi Arabia on 25 January 2021 to spread his home-health business in the country, which he had visited twice since 2017. On his arrival, the New Albany businessman faced 3-day detention for no discernible reason. According to his statements, the detention facility was cramped, cold, and didn't offer masks despite housing eight other inmates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaani claimed that he suffered \"mentally, physically and emotionally\" and just wanted \"justice\". His call to the United States consulate in the country went unanswered. On the third day of his detention, Gaani was informed that he could leave, without receiving any explanation or apology for the incident.[183]\n\n\n\n### Companies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of largest companies of Saudi Arabia and List of companies of Saudi Arabia\n\n#### Saudi Aramco[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco (officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.) is Saudi Arabia's national oil, petroleum, and natural gas company headquartered in Dhahran.[184][185][186] Saudi Aramco was listed for public trading on 10 December 2019 and had a valuation as of US$2 trillion as of 12 December 2019.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has both the second largest proven crude oil reserves, which it claims to be more than 260 billion barrels (4.1×1010 m3), and the largest daily oil production.[187] The company operates the world's largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. Its yearly production is 3.479 billion barrels (553,100,000 m3),[188] and it manages over 100 oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 284.8 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves.[188] Saudi Aramco owns the Ghawar Field, the world's largest oil field, and the Shaybah Field, another one of the world's largest oil fields.[189]\n\n\nOn 16 November 2020, Saudi Aramco announced hiring banks to sell dollar-denominated bonds with the aim of improving finances after the coronavirus pandemic caused a sharp fall in the global demand for crude oil. Aramco's multi-tranche offer was set to run between 3 and 50 years, depending on the market conditions. The banks hired for the transaction included Citi Bank, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and NCB Capital.[190] Other banks involved in the deal included BNP Paribas, BOC International, BofA Securities, Credit Agricole, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC Nikko and Societe Generale.[191]\n\n\nIn 2021, Saudi Aramco made a net-income of 95.5 billion riyals ($25.5 billion) in the second quarter alone, which was the highest level since 2018.[192]\n\n\n\n#### SABIC[edit]\n\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC was established by a royal decree in 1976 to produce chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. In 2008, SABIC was Asia's largest (in terms of market capitalization) and most profitable publicly listed non-oil company, the world's fourth-largest petrochemical company, the second-largest producer of ethylene glycol and methanol in the world, the third-largest producer of polyethylene and overall the fourth-largest producer of polypropylene and polyolefin. It ranked 186th as the world's largest corporation on the Fortune Global 500 for 2009. Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings claimed SABIC to be the world's largest producer of polymers and the Persian Gulf region's largest steel producer for 2005 and assigned SABIC an \"A\" corporate credit rating. In 2008, Fortune 500 ranking records SABIC revenues at $40.2 billion, profits at $5.8 billion, and assets standing at $72.4 billion.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Ma'aden (company)[edit]\n\n\nMa'aden was formed as a Saudi joint stock company on 23 March 1997 for the purpose of facilitating the development of Saudi Arabia's mineral resources. Ma'aden's activities have focused on its active gold business which has grown in recent years to include the operation of five gold mines: Mahd Ad Dahab, Al Hajar, Sukhaybarat, Bulghah, and Al Amar. Ma'aden is now expanding its activities beyond its gold business with the development of phosphates, aluminium, and other projects. In addition, since its formation, Ma'aden (through the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources) has collaborated with the government and local legislators to develop a regulatory framework for the governance of the mining industry.\n\n\n\n#### ICT Services[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(March 2022)*\n |\n\n\nSaudi Arabia experienced a boom in computer use since deregulation in 2002. The number of PCs per capita grew from 13% of the population owning a computer in 2002 to nearly 43% in 2005, leapfrogging the rest of West Asia. By 2018, 50.57% of the population owned computers.[194] The electrical and electronic market was estimated to be around $3.5 billion in 2004.[195]\n\n\nThe Saudi ICT sector has grown significantly over the last decade and is still showing strong growth. In 2012, ICT sector spending was recorded at SAR 94 billion, with 13.9% annual growth, and reached approximately SAR 102 billion in 2013, with approximately 14% annual growth.[196]\n\n\nThe e-commerce market was estimated at just over $1 billion in 2001, and grew to an estimated $7.7 billion in 2021.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agriculture in Saudi Arabia\n* Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)\n* Energy in Saudi Arabia\n* List of Saudi cities by GDP per capita\n* Tourism in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at 3.75 riyals per USD since 1986[1][2]\n2. **^** Data are for total population; unemployment among Saudi nationals is more than double[5]\n\n1. **^** immigrants make up 38.3% of the total population, according to UN data (2019)[5]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Strohecker, Karin (27 April 2016). \"Saudi riyal peg pressure eases, but not gone\". *reuters.com*.

The previous plan called for slashing unemployment to 2.8% only to see it rise to 10.5% in 2009, the end of that plan period. Government plans in Saudi are like those in the old Soviet Union, grandiose but unmet. (Also, as in the old Soviet Union, nearly all Saudi official statistics are unreliable, so economists believe the real Saudi unemployment rate is closer to 40%)\n86. **^** Al Omran, Ahmed (10 July 2018). \"Record numbers of foreign workers leave Saudi Arabia\". *Financial Times*.
