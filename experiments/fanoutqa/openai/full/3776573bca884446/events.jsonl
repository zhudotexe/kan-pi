It is commonly used by the United States government and private institutions to describe a household's economic status or to track economic trends in the US.\n\n\nA key measure of household income is the median income, at which half of households have income above that level and half below. The U.S. Census Bureau reports two median household income estimates based on data from two surveys: the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). The CPS is the recommended source for national-level estimates, whereas the ACS gives estimates for many geographic levels.[2]: 19[3]: 10 According to the CPS, the median household income was $70,784 in 2021.[4][2] According to the ACS, the U.S. median household income in 2018 was $61,937.[3] Estimates for previous years are given in terms of real income, which have been adjusted for changes to the price of goods and services.\n\n\nThe distribution of U.S. household income has become more unequal since around 1980, with the income share received by the top 1% trending upward from around 10% or less over the 1953–1981 period to over 20% by 2007.[5] After falling somewhat due to the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, inequality rose again during the economic recovery, to a level not seen since the gilded age.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\nA household's income can be calculated in various ways but the US Census as of 2009 measured it in the following manner: the income of every resident of that house that is over the age of 15, including pre-tax wages and salaries, along with any pre-tax personal business, investment, or other recurring sources of income, as well as any kind of governmental entitlement such as unemployment insurance, social security, disability payments or child support payments received.[8]\n\n\nThe residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household's income.[9] As households tend to share a similar economic context, the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income. That the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories, and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible.[10] The US Census does not include noncash benefits such as health benefits.[11]\n\n\n\n## Recent trends[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. economic growth is not translating into higher median family incomes. Real GDP per household has typically increased since the year 2000, while real median income per household was below 1999 levels until 2016, indicating a trend of greater income inequality.[12]\n![](image)Total compensation's share of GDP has declined by 4.5 percentage points from 1970 to 2016. This implies that the share attributed to capital increased in that period.\n![](image)U.S. real wages (i.e. production) for ordinary (i.e. non-supervisory) workers remain slightly below their 1970s peak.[13]\nThe Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau reported in September 2022 that real median household income was $70,784 in 2021, not statistically different from the 2020 estimate of $71,186.[4]\n\n\nChanges in median income reflect several trends: the aging of the population, changing patterns in work and schooling, and the evolving makeup of the American family, as well as long- and short-term trends in the economy itself. For instance, the retirement of the Baby Boom generation should push down overall median income, as more persons enter lower-income retirement. However, analysis of different working age groups indicate a similar pattern of stagnating median income as well.[14]\n\n\nJournalist Annie Lowrey wrote in September 2014: \"The root causes [of wage stagnation] include technological change, the decline of labor unions, and globalization, economists think, though they disagree sharply on how much to weight each factor. But foreign-produced goods became sharply cheaper, meaning imports climbed and production moved overseas. And computers took over for humans in many manufacturing, clerical, and administrative tasks, eroding middle-class jobs growth and suppressing wages.\"[15]\n\n\nAnother line of analysis, known as \"total compensation\", presents a more complete picture of real wages. The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a study in 2013 which shows that employer contributions to employee healthcare costs went up 78% from 2003 to 2013.[16] The marketplace has made a trade-off: expanding benefits packages vs. increasing wages.\n\n\nMeasured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets). This trend is common across the developed world, due in part to globalization.[17] Wages and salaries have fallen from approximately 51% GDP in 1970 to 43% GDP in 2013. Total compensation has fallen from approximately 58% GDP in 1970 to 53% GDP in 2013.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHowever, as indicated by the charts below, household income has still increased significantly since the late 1970s and early 80s in real terms, partly due to higher individual median wages, and partly due to increased employment of women.\n\n\nAccording to the **CBO**, between 1979 and 2011, gross median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose from $59,400 to $75,200, or 26.5%.[18] However, once adjusted for household size and looking at taxes from an after-tax perspective, real median household income grew 46%, representing significant growth.[19]\n\n\nThe following table summarizes real median household income at key recent milestones:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Variable\n | 1999 Previous Record\n | 2007 Pre-Crisis Peak\n | 2012 Post-Crisis Trough\n | 2016 Previous Record\n | 2017 Previous Record\n | 2018 Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Real median household income[20] | $61,526\n | $60,985\n | $55,900\n | $61,779\n | $62,626\n | $63,179\n |\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\nUse of individual household income: The government and organizations may look at one particular household's income to decide if a person is eligible for certain programs, such as nutrition assistance[21] or need-based financial aid,[22] among many others.\n\n\nUse at the aggregate level: Summaries of household incomes across groups of people – often the entire country – are also studied as part of economic trends like standard of living and distribution of income and wealth. Household income as an economic measure can be represented as a median, a mean, a distribution, and other ways. Household income can be studied across time, region, education level, race/ethnicity, and many other dimensions. As an indicator of economic trends, it may be studied along with related economic measures such as disposable income, debt, household net worth (which includes debt and investments, durable goods like cars and houses), wealth, and employment statistics.\n\n\n\n## Median inflation-adjusted (\"real\") household income[edit]\n\n\nMedian inflation-adjusted (\"real\") household income generally increases and decreases with the business cycle, declining in each year during the periods 1979 through 1983, 1990 through 1993, 2000 through 2004 and 2008 through 2012, while rising in each of the intervening years.[18] Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per person per day before government benefits, more than doubled in absolute terms from 636,000 to 1.46 million households (including 2.8 million children) between 1996 and 2011, with most of this increase occurring between late 2008 and early 2011.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Median household income, by county, as of 2017.\n### CBO income growth study[edit]\n\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office conducted a study analyzing household income throughout the income distribution, by combining the Census and IRS income data sources. Unlike the Census measure of household income, the CBO showed income before and after taxes, and by also taking into account household size.[24] Also, the CBO definition of income is much broader, and includes in kind transfers as well as all monetary transfers from the government.[24] The Census' official definition of money income excludes food stamps and the EITC, for example, while CBO includes it.\n\n\nBetween 1979 and 2011, gross median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose from $59,400 to $75,200, or 26.5%. This compares with the Census' growth of 10%.[18] However, once adjusted for household size and looking at taxes from an after-tax perspective, real median household income grew 46%, representing significant growth.[19]\n\n\nWhile median gross household income showed much stronger growth than depicted by the Census, inequality was shown to still have increased. The top 10% saw gross household income grow by 78%, versus 26.5% for the median. The bottom 10%, using the same measure, saw higher growth than the median (40%).[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)This graph shows the income since 1970 of different racial and ethnic groups in the United States (in 2014 dollars).[25]\nSince 1980, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has increased 67%,[26] while median household income has only increased by 15%. Median household income is a politically sensitive indicator. Voters can be critical of their government if they perceive that their cost of living is rising faster than their income.\n\n\nThe early-2000s recession began with the bursting of the dot-com bubble and affected most advanced economies including the European Union, Japan and the United States. An economic recession will normally cause household incomes to decrease, often by as much as 10%.\n\n\nThe late-2000s recession began with the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble, which caused a problem in the dangerously exposed sub prime-mortgage market. This in turn triggered a global financial crisis. In constant price, 2011 American median household income was 1.13% lower than what it was in 1989. This corresponds to a 0.05% annual decrease over a 22-year period.[27] In the meantime, GDP per capita has increased by 33.8% or 1.33% annually.[28]\n\n\nA study on US Census income data claims that when using the national accounting methodology, U.S. gross median household income was $57,739 in 2010 (table 3).[29]\n\n\nIn 2015, the US median household income spiked 5.2 per cent, reaching $56,000, making it the first annual hike in median household income since the start of the Great Recession.[30]\n\n\n\n## Mean household income[edit]\n\n\nAnother common measurement of personal income is the mean household income. Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households.[31] The mean income is more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top.[32] As a result, the mean income in the United States is higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641.[33]\n\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau provides the following breakdown by self-identified ethnic groups as of March 2018:\n\n\n\n\n\nMean household income by ethnicity[33]\n| Ethnic category\n | Mean household income\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian alone | $119,816\n |\n| White alone | $93,948\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino | $70,945\n |\n| Black | $59,363\n |\n\n\n## Mean vs. median household income[edit]\n\n\n\n> Median income is the amount which divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group. The means and medians for households and families are based on all households and families. Means and medians for people are based on people 15 years old and over with income.\n> \n> — US Census Bureau, Frequently Asked Question, published by First Gov.[31]\n> \n\n\n## Aggregate income distribution[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(August 2018)*\n |\n\n\nThe aggregate income measures the combined income earned by all persons in a particular income group. In 2018, the total personal income earned in the United States was $17.6 trillion.[34] In 2008, all households in the United States earned roughly $12,442.2 billion.[34] One half, 49.98%, of all income in the US was earned by households with an income over $100,000, the top twenty percent. Over one quarter, 28.5%, of all income was earned by the top 8%, those households earning more than $150,000 a year. The top 3.65%, with incomes over $200,000, earned 17.5%. Households with annual incomes from $50,000 to $75,000, 18.2% of households, earned 16.5% of all income. Households with annual incomes from $50,000 to $95,000, 28.1% of households, earned 28.8% of all income. The bottom 10.3% earned 1.06% of all income.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\n### Racial and Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of ethnic groups in the United States by household income\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\npersonal and household income\n\nin the United States Census\n\nin 2005\n\nAmericans who identified as White Alone, headed up roughly 77.79% of all households in 2021,[35] but those same households comprised 81.43% of households in the top 5% of household income. Conversely, Americans who identified as Black alone headed up only 5.33% of households in the top 5%, whereas such households made up 13.49% of all households.[35]\n\n\nOverall, households headed by Hispanic and Black Americans were underrepresented in the top two quintiles and overrepresented in the bottom two quintiles. Households headed by people who identified as being Asian alone were also overrepresented among the top two quintiles. In the top five percent the percentage of Asians was nearly twice as high as the percentage of Asians among the general population. White households are underrepresented in the lowest quintile and slightly overrepresented in the top two quintiles and the top five percent.[35]\n\n\nIn terms of race in **2020 data**, Asian-American households had the highest median household income of $94,903, White households ranked second with $74,912, Hispanic or Latino households ranked third with $55,321.

The data only includes households with a householder over the age of twenty-five.[37]\nHousehold income as well as per capita income in the United States rise significantly as the educational attainment increases.[38] In 2005 graduates with a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) who accepted job offers were expected to earn a base salary of $88,626. They were also expected to receive an \"average signing bonus of $17,428.\"[39]\n\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau persons with doctorates in the United States had an average income of roughly $81,400. The average for an advanced degree was $72,824, with men averaging $90,761 and women averaging $50,756 annually. Year-round full-time workers with a professional degree had an average income of $109,600 while those with a master's degree had an average income of $62,300. Overall, \"…[a]verage earnings ranged from $18,900 for high school dropouts to $25,900 for high school graduates, $45,400 for college graduates and $99,300 for workers with professional degrees (M.D., O.D., D.P.T., D.P.M., D.O., J.D., Pharm.D., D.D.S., or D.V.M.).\"[40]\n\n\nIndividuals with graduate degrees have an average per capita income exceeding the median household income of married couple families among the general population ($63,813 annually).[40][41] Higher educational attainment did not, however, help close the income gap between the genders as the life-time earnings for a male with a professional degree were roughly forty percent (39.59%) higher than those of a female with a professional degree. The lifetime earnings gap between males and females was the smallest for those individuals holding an associate degrees with male life-time earnings being 27.77% higher than those of females. While educational attainment did not help reduce the income inequality between men and women, it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes, enabling many households with one or more graduate degree householders to enter the top household income quintile.[40] These data were not adjusted for preferential differences among men and women whom attend college.\n\n\nHousehold income also increased significantly with the educational attainment of the householder. The US Census Bureau publishes educational attainment and income data for all households with a householder who was aged twenty-five or older. The biggest income difference was between those with some college education and those who had a Bachelor's degree, with the latter making $23,874 more annually. Income also increased substantially with increased post-secondary education. While the median annual household income for a household with a householder having an associate degree was $51,970, the median annual household income for householders with a bachelor's degree or higher was $73,446. Those with doctorates had the second highest median household with a median of $96,830; $18,289 more than that for those at the master's degree level, but $3,170 lower than the median for households with a professional degree holding householder.[37]\n\n\n\n#### Distribution of household income by educational attainment and gender in 2019 according to US Census data[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Criteria\n | Overall\n | Less than 9th grade\n | Some high school\n | High school graduate or equivalent\n | Some college\n | Associate degree\n | Bachelor's degree\n | Bachelor's degree or more\n | Master's degree\n | Professional degree\n | Doctoral degree\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Median annual individual income[42] | Male, age 25+\n | $52,297 | $29,405 | $32,112 | $41,580 | $49,676 | $53,082 | $70,968 | $78,156 | $89,915 | $135,970 | $112,305\n |\n| Female, age 25+\n | $40,294 | $20,252 | $21,851 | $28,166 | $32,679 | $35,970 | $50,691 | $56,047 | $61,861 | $88,301 | $87,394\n |\n| Age 25+\n | $46,985 | $25,162 | $26,092 | $35,540 | $39,362 | $42,391 | $60,705 | $66,432 | $71,851 | $102,741 | $101,526\n |\n| Median annual household income[43] | $70,308 | $30,355 | $31,326 | $48,708 | $61,911 | $69,573 | $100,164 | $108,646 | $117,439 | $162,127 | $142,347\n |\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Overall, the median household income increased with the age of householder until retirement age when household income started to decline.[47] The highest median household income was found among households headed by working baby-boomers.[47]\n\n\nHouseholds headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median household income of $61,111 and a mean household income of $77,634. The median income per member of household for this particular group was $27,924. The highest median income per member of household was among those between the ages of 54 and 64 with $30,544 [The reason this figure is lower than the next group is because pensions and Social Security add to income while a portion of older individuals also have work-related income.].[47]\n\n\nThe group with the second highest median household income, were households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median income of $56,785, followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64 with $50,400. Not surprisingly the lowest income group was composed of those households headed by individuals younger than 24, followed by those headed by persons over the age of 75. Overall, households headed by persons above the age of seventy-five had a median household income of $20,467 with the median household income per member of household being $18,645. These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the median income per member of household peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons, increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64. With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining, the median household income decreases as well.[47]\n\n\n\n### Household size[edit]\n\n\nWhile median household income has a tendency to increase up to four persons per household, it declines for households beyond four persons. For example, in the state of Alabama in 2004, two-person households had a median income of $39,755, with $48,957 for three-person households, $54,338 for four-person households, $50,905 for five-person households, $45,435 for six-person households, with seven-or-more-person households having the second lowest median income of only $42,471.[48]\n\n\n\n## Geography and Socioeconomic correlations[edit]\n\n\nConsidering other racial and geographical differences in regards to household income, it should come as no surprise that the median household income varies with race, size of household and geography. The state with the highest median household income in the United States as of the US Census Bureau 2009 is Maryland with $69,272, followed by New Jersey, Connecticut and Alaska, making the Northeastern United States the wealthiest area by income in the entire country.[49]\n\n\nRegionally, in 2010, the Northeast reached a median income of $53,283, the West, $53,142, the South, $45,492, and the Midwest, $48,445.[50] Each figure represents a decline from the previous year.\n\n\n\n### Median household income by state[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of U.S. states and territories by income\n\n![](image)Map of states by median household income in 2019.\nIn 2007, the median household income by state ranged from $36,338 in Mississippi to $68,080 in Maryland. Despite having the highest median home price in the nation[51] and home prices that far outpaced incomes,[52] California ranked only eighth in income that year, with a median household income of $59,984. While California's median income was not near enough to afford the average California home or even a starter home, West Virginia, which had one of the nation's lowest median household incomes, also had the nation's lowest median home price.[51][53]\n\n\nWhen grouped by Census Bureau Region, of the 15 states that, in 2017, had the highest median household income, only Minnesota is located in the **Mid-West**. Five are in the **Northeast** (*Connecticut*, *Massachusetts*, *New Hampshire*, *New Jersey* and *Rhode Island*), three are **South Atlantic states** (*Washington D.C., Maryland* and *Virginia*) while the remaining six are in the **West** (*Alaska*, *California*, *Colorado*, *Hawaii, Washington* and *Utah*).\n\n\nThe southern states had, on average, the lowest median household income, with nine of the country's fifteen poorest states located in the South. However, most of the poverty in the South is located in rural areas. Metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, Raleigh, Birmingham, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are areas within the southern states that have above average income levels. Overall, median household income tended to be the highest in the nation's most urbanized northeastern, upper midwestern and west coast states, while rural areas, mostly in the southern and mountain states (like New Mexico, Montana and Idaho), had the lowest median household income.[53]\n\n\nAs of 2019, the median household income ranged from $20,474 in Puerto Rico to $92,266 in the District of Columbia. Note that the U.S. Census Bureau treats Puerto Rico as if it were a state (Puerto Rico is included in the American Community Survey).[54]\n\n\nAll data is from the 2009–2019 American Community Survey

one of the most prominent indicators of social class. Household income and education do not, however, always reflect perceived class status correctly. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that \"... the class structure... does not exactly match the distribution of household income\" with \"the mismatch [being] greatest in the middle...\" (Gilbert, 1998: 92) As social classes commonly overlap, it is not possible to define exact class boundaries.\n\n\nAccording to Leonard Beeghley[*citation needed*] a household income of roughly $95,000 would be typical of a dual-earner middle class household while $60,000 would be typical of a dual-earner working class household and $18,000 typical for an impoverished household. William Thompson and Joseph Hickey[*citation needed*] see common incomes for the upper class as those exceeding $500,000 with upper middle class incomes ranging from the high 5-figures to most commonly in excess of $100,000. They claim the lower middle class ranges from $35,000 to $75,000; $16,000 to $30,000 for the working class and less than $2,000 for the lower class.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic class models\n| Dennis Gilbert, 2002\n | William Thompson & Joseph Hickey, 2005\n | Leonard Beeghley, 2004\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Class\n | Typical characteristics\n | Class\n | Typical characteristics\n | Class\n | Typical characteristics\n |\n| Capitalist class (1%)\n | Top-level executives, high-rung politicians, heirs.

Wealth is the total value of net possessions of an individual or household, while income is the total inflow of monetary assets over a given time period. Hence the change in wealth over that time period is equal to the income minus the expenditures in that period. Income is a so-called \"flow\" variable, while wealth is a so-called \"stock\" variable.\n\n\n\n## Income as a metric[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breakdowns of individuals and households with incomes exceeding $60,000 (2005 data)[4][5]\n![](image)The image contains several charts related to U.S. wealth inequality. While U.S. net worth roughly doubled from 2000 to 2016, the gains went primarily to the wealthy.\nAffluence in the United States has been attributed in many cases to inherited wealth amounting to \"a substantial head start\":[6][7] in September 2012, the Institute for Policy Studies found that over 60 percent of the Forbes richest 400 Americans had grown up with substantial privilege.[8]\n\n\nIncome is commonly used to measure affluence, although this is a relative indicator: a middle class person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may both be referred to as affluent, depending on reference groups. An average American with a median income of $32,000[9] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the ages of 25 and 64)[10] when used as a reference group would justify the personal income in the tenth percentile of $77,500 being described as affluent,[9] but if this earner were compared to an executive of a Fortune 500 company, then the description would not apply.[11][12] Accordingly, marketing firms and investment houses classify those with household incomes exceeding $250,000 as mass affluent, while the threshold upper class is most commonly defined as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $525,000 annually.\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 42% of U.S. households have two income earners, thus making households' income levels higher than personal income levels;[13] the percent of married-couple families with children where both parents work is 59.1%.[14]\n\n\nIn 2005, the economic survey revealed the following income distribution for households and individuals:\n\n\n\n* The top 5% of individuals had six figure incomes (exceeding $100,000); the top 10% of individuals had incomes exceeding $75,000;[9]\n* The top 5% of households, three quarters of whom had two income earners, had incomes of $166,200 (about 10 times the 2009 US minimum wage, for one income earner, and about 5 times the 2009 US minimum wage for two income earners) or higher,[13] with the top 10% having incomes well in excess of $100,000.[15]\n* The top 0.12% of households had incomes exceeding $1,600,000 annually.[16]\n\n\nHouseholds may also be differentiated among each other, depending on whether or not they have one or multiple income earners (the high female participation in the economy means that many households have two working members[17]). For example, in 2005 the median household income for a two income earner households was $67,000 while the median income for an individual employed full-time with a graduate degree was in excess of $60,000, demonstrating that nearly half of individuals with a graduate degree have earnings comparable with most dual income households.[10]\n\n\nBy another measure – the number of square feet per person in the home – the average home in the United States has more than 700 square feet per person, 50% – 100% more than in other high-income countries (though this indicator may be regarded as an accident of geography, climate and social preference, both within the US and beyond it) but this metric indicates even those in the lowest income percentiles enjoy more living space than the middle classes in most European nations[*failed verification*]. Similarly ownership levels of 'gadgets' and access to amenities are exceptionally high compared to many other countries.[18][19]\n\n\nOverall, the term affluent may be applied to a variety of individuals, households, or other entities, depending on context. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the main guideline for defining affluence. U.S. government data not only reveal the nation's income distribution but also the demographic characteristics of those to whom the term \"affluent\", may be applied.[13]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n**Wealth in the United States** is commonly measured in terms of net worth, which is the sum of all assets, including the market value of real estate, like a home, minus all liabilities.[20] The United States is the wealthiest country in the world.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Household and non-profit Net Worth 1959 – 2016, nominal and real (2016 dollars). It reached a record $93 trillion in Q4 2016.\nFor example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000. Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's assets (900,000 − $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets.\n\n\nAs one would expect, households with greater income often have the highest net worths, though high income cannot be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth. Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise, with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers.[20] In addition, wealth is unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest 25% of US households owning 87%[22] of the wealth in the United States, which was $54.2 trillion in 2009.[23][24]\n\n\nU.S. household and non-profit organization net worth rose from $44.2 trillion in Q1 2000 to a pre-recession peak of $67.7 trillion in Q3 2007. It then fell $13.1 trillion to $54.6 trillion in Q1 2009 due to the subprime mortgage crisis. It then recovered, rising consistently to $86.8 trillion by Q4 2015. This is nearly double the 2000 level.[25]\n\n\n\n### Mechanisms to gain wealth[edit]\n\n\nAssets are known as the raw materials of wealth, and they consist primarily of stocks and other financial and non-financial property, particularly homeownership.[26] While tangible assets are unequally distributed, financial assets are much more unequal. In 2004, the top 1% controlled 50.3% of the financial assets while the bottom 90% held only 14.4% of the total US financial assets.[26]\n\n\nThese discrepancies exist because the many wealth building tools established by the Federal Government work better for high earners. These include 401k plans, 403b plans, and IRAs. Traditional IRAs, 401k and 403b plans are tax shelters created for working individuals. These plans allow for tax sheltered (or pre-tax) contributions of earned income directly to tax sheltered savings accounts. Annual contributions are capped to ensure that high earners cannot enjoy the tax benefit disproportionately. The Roth IRA is another tool that can help create wealth in the working and middle classes.\n\n\nAssets in Roth IRAs grow tax free; interests, dividends, and capital gains are all exempt from income taxes. Contributions to Roth IRAs are limited to those with annual incomes less than the threshold established yearly by the IRS. The benefits of these plans, however, are only available to workers and families whose incomes and expenses allow them excess funds to commit for a long period, typically until the investor reaches age 59½. The effect of these tools are further limited by the contribution limits placed on them.\n\n\nIncluding human capital such as skills, the United Nations International Human Dimensions Programme estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $118 trillion.[27][28]\n\n\n\n## Top percentiles of income[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information**.

Economic ranking is conducted either in terms of giving lower thresholds for a designated group (e.g. the top 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.) or in terms of the percentage of households/individuals with incomes above a certain threshold (e.g. above $75,000, $100,000, $150,000, etc.). The table below presents 2006 income data in terms of the lower thresholds for the given percentages (e.g. the top 25.6% of households had incomes exceeding $80,000, compared to $47,000 for the top quarter of individuals).[9][15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Data\n | Top third\n | Top quarter\n | Top quintile\n | Top 15%\n | Top 10%\n | Top 5%\n | Top 3%\n | Top 1.5%\n | Top 0.1%[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Household income[15] |\n| Lower threshold (annual gross income) | $65,000 | $80,000 | $91,202 | $100,000 | $118,200 | $166,200 | $200,000 | $250,000 | $1,600,000\n |\n| Exact percentage of households | 34.72% | 25.60% | 20.00% | 17.80% | 10.00% | 5.00% | 2.67% | 1.50% | 0.12%\n |\n| Personal income (age 25+)[9] |\n| Lower threshold (annual gross income) | $37,500 | $47,500 | $52,500 | $62,500 | $75,000 | $100,000 | N/A\n |\n| Exact percentage of individuals | 33.55% | 24.03% | 19.74% | 14.47% | 10.29% | 5.63% | N/A\n |\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, 2006[9][15]\n\n\n\n### Household income over time[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Income in the United States\n\nHousehold income changes over time, with income gains being substantially larger for the upper percentiles than for the lower percentiles.[29] All areas of the income strata have seen their incomes rise since the late 1960s, especially during the late 1990s.[30] The overall increase in household income is not the result of an increase in the percentage of households with more than one income earner. In fact, the lowest 50% population have become very poor[*citation needed*] sharing just 2% of wealth in spite of modern social practice of more than one working person, mostly women in the household. But the myth is highly prevalent and promoted by media. The standard of living of a 1960s single working parent can only be afforded today when both parents work due to disproportionate distribution of wealth today:[17]\n\n\nIn about 2003, Elizabeth Warren said that \"the typical middle-class household in the United States is no longer a one-earner family, with one parent in the workforce and one at home full-time. Instead, the majority of families with small children now have both parents rising at dawn to commute to jobs so they can both pull in paychecks... Today the median income for a fully employed male is ...nearly $800 less than his counterpart of a generation ago. The only real increase in wages for a family has come from the second paycheck earned by a working mother.\"[17]\n\n\nTwo income-earner households are more common among the top quintile of households than the general population: 2006 U.S. Census Bureau data indicates that over three quarters, 76%, of households in the top quintile, with annual incomes exceeding $91,200, had two or more income earners compared to just 42% among the general population and a small minority in the bottom three quintiles. As a result, much of the rising income inequity between the upper and lower percentiles can be explained through the increasing percentage of households with two or more incomes.[17][29]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Data\n | 2003\n | 2000\n | 1997\n | 1994\n | 1991\n | 1988\n | 1985\n | 1982\n | 1979\n | 1976\n | 1973\n | 1970\n | 1967\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 20th percentile | $17,984 | $19,142 | $17,601 | $16,484 | $16,580 | $17,006 | $16,306 | $15,548 | $16,457 | $15,615 | $15,844 | $15,126 | $14,002\n |\n| Median (50th) | $43,318 | $44,853 | $42,294 | $39,613 | $39,679 | $40,678 | $38,510 | $36,811 | $38,649 | $36,155 | $37,700 | $35,832 | $33,338\n |\n| 80th percentile | $86,867 | $87,341 | $81,719 | $77,154 | $74,759 | $75,593 | $71,433 | $66,920 | $68,318 | $63,247 | $64,500 | $60,148 | $55,265\n |\n| 95th percentile | $154,120 | $155,121 | $144,636 | $134,835 | $126,969 | $127,958 | $119,459 | $111,516 | $111,445 | $100,839 | $102,243 | $95,090 | $88,678\n |\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau (2004): \"Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2003\", p. 36 et seq.

Graph accounts for both income growth, and the hidden decline in the progressivity of the tax code at the top, the wealthiest earners having seen their *effective* tax rates steadily fall.[31]\n![](image)\nSame data[31] as adjacent chart, but plotted on logarithmic scale to show absolute dollar amounts.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%.[32] In 2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum income of $343,927.[33][34][35]\n\n\nDuring the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928.[34] According to PolitiFact and others, the top 400 wealthiest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\"[36][37][38][39] Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a \"substantial head start\".[6][7] In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, \"over 60 percent\" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans \"grew up in substantial privilege\".[8]\n\n\nIf a family has a positive net worth then it has more wealth than the combined net worth of over 30.6 million American families. This is because the bottom 25% of American families have a negative combined net worth.[40]\n\n\n\n### Complications in interpreting income statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(January 2018)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nInterpreting these income statistics is complicated by several factors: membership in the top 1% changes from year to year, the IRS made large changes in the definition of adjusted gross income in 1987, and numbers for particular income ranges may be distorted by outliers (in the top segment) and failure to include transfer payments (in the lower segments).\n\n\nRegarding Income Mobility, the IRS occasionally studies income data from actual households over time, usually over one decade. Their results underestimate income mobility by excluding those under age 25, the most mobile population, from their studies.\n\n\nMany people[41][42][43][*who?*] look only at annual reported income data split into income quintiles. It is erroneous to assume that individual households remain in the same quintile over time, just as it usually is when using aggregate data. A majority of households in the top income quintile in one year, for example, will have moved to a lower quintile within a decade. Three out of four households in the top 0.01% of income will no longer be in that small group ten years later. In summary, half of all of U.S. households move from one income quintile to a different income quintile every decade. And actual households who started a decade in the lowest quintile of income, when tracked over the next ten years, will have proportionally more income growth than actual households who started the decade in the highest quintile of income. Thus, when comparing income/wealth quintile distributions from different time periods, generalizations can only be made with regards to the households in aggregate for each quintile, and can not be made to any individual households over the same time period (i.e. assuming the wealth value has been appropriately adjusted for differences in time, one cannot infer that a decrease in total wealth percentage for one quintile over time means that the households from that quintile have lost wealth as individuals, but only that total wealth percentage has decreased for those in that quintile at the time of measurement).\n\n\nTop 20% income vs. the bottom 20% income households:\n\n\n\n1. The average number of people with jobs in a top income quintile household is two, while a majority of bottom-income-quintile households have no-one employed.\n2. If there are two adult income earners in a household who are married, their incomes are combined on tax forms. This is very common among top-quintile-income households. The lowest-quintile households, however, include a lot more single-person households, or two unmarried working adults living together and sharing expenses, but reporting their incomes to the IRS as if they were two separate households.\n3. 75%...80%[*clarification needed*] of actual income for bottom-quintile-households consists of specific transfer payments from social or relief programs (aka \"welfare\" and other benefits), which payments are not included in IRS data as income. The top income quintile gets a very small percentage of their actual income from transfer payments.\n4. The IRS warns against comparisons of pre-1987 and post-1987 income data due to significant changes in the definition of adjusted gross income (AGI) that made top-quintile households appear to have large reported income gains, when in fact there was no change to their income at all. In addition to AGI changes, large marginal tax rate reductions during the Reagan Administration caused another large change in tax reporting. A lot of corporate income formerly reported on corporate tax returns was switched to lower-tax-rate individual tax returns (as Subchapter S corporations). This reporting change appeared to boost top-quintile income, when in fact their incomes had not changed. As a result, the top income quintile for households today includes a lot of corporate income previously reported in corporate tax returns, while Subchapter S corporations that lose money, are likely to be included in the bottom-income-quintile households. Income comparisons that compare pre-1987 to post-1987 income, are very common, but they are also biased, according to the IRS, and should be ignored.[44]\n\n\nImpact of age and experience: people that are older and have more experience, tend to have considerably larger incomes than younger and inexperienced workers. Normalizing for age and experience is rarely an effective statistical compensation, as each elderly citizen began as inexperienced.\n\n\n\n### Median income levels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Personal income in the United States and Household income in the United States\n\n\n\nMedian household income by selected characteristics [45]\n| Type of household\n | Race and Hispanic origin\n | Region\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| All households\n | Familyhouseholds\n | Nonfamilyhouseholds\n | Asian | Non-Hispanic White | Hispanic(of any race)\n | Black | Northeast | Midwest | South | West |\n| $70,784 | $91,162 | $41,797 | $101,418 | $77,999 | $57,981 | $48,297 | $77,422 | $71,129 | $63,368 | $79,430\n |\n\n\n\n\nMedian household income by selected characteristics cont.\n| Age of Householder\n | Nativity of Householder\n | Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) Status\n | Educational Attainment of Householder\\*\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Under 65 years\n | 65 years and older\n | Native-born\n | Foreign-born\n | Inside MSA\n | Outside MSA\n | No high school diploma\n | High school, no college\n | Some college\n | Bachelor's degree or higher\n |\n| $80,734 | $47,620 | $71,522 | $66,043 | $73,823 | $53,750 | $30,378 | $50,401 | $64,378 | $115,456\n |\n|  \\*Householders aged 25 and older.

Financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.[49] However, according to the federal reserve, \"For most households, pensions and Social Security are the most important sources of income during retirement, and the promised benefit stream constitutes a sizable fraction of household wealth\" and \"including pensions and Social Security in net worth makes the distribution more even\".[50] When including household wealth from pensions and social security, the richest 1% of the American population in 1992 owned 16% of the country's total wealth, as opposed to 32% when excluding pensions and social security.\n\n\nAfter the Great Recession which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%.[51][49]\n\n\n\n## Changes in wealth[edit]\n\n\n### 1989–2001[edit]\n\n\nWhen observing the changes in the wealth among American households, one can note an increase in wealthier individuals and a decrease in the number of poor households, while net worth increased most substantially in semi-wealthy and wealthy households. Overall the percentage of households with a negative net worth (more debt than assets) declined from 9.5% in 1989 to 4.1% in 2001.[20]\n\n\nThe percentage of net worths ranging from $500,000 to one million doubled while the percentage of millionaires tripled.[20] From 1995 to 2004, there was tremendous growth among household wealth, as it nearly doubled from $21.9 trillion to $43.6 trillion, but the wealthiest quartile of the economic distribution made up 89% of this growth.[23] During this time frame, wealth became increasingly unequal, and the wealthiest 25% became even wealthier.\n\n\nAccording to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, this 'upward shift' is most likely the result of a booming housing market which caused homeowners to experience tremendous increases in home equity. Life-cycles have also attributed to the rising wealth among Americans. With more and more baby-boomers reaching the climax of their careers and the middle-aged population making up a larger segment of the population now than ever before, more and more households have achieved comfortable levels of wealth.[20] Zhu Xiao Di (2004) notes, that household wealth usually peaks around families headed by people in their 50s, and as a result, the baby boomer generation reached this age range at the time of the analysis.[23]\n\n\n\n### After 2007[edit]\n\n\nHousehold net worth fell from 2007 to 2009 by a total of $17.5 trillion or 25.5%. This was the equivalent loss of one year of GDP.[52]\nBy the fourth quarter of 2010, the household net worth had recovered by a growth of 1.3 percent to a total of $56.8 trillion. An additional growth of 15.7 percent is needed just to bring the value to where it was before the recession started in December 2007.[22] In 2014 a record breaking net worth of $80.7 trillion was achieved.[53]\n\n\n\n## Professions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: High-net-worth individual\n\nAccording to the University of Chicago, the top 1% is primarily made up of owner-managers of small to medium-sized businesses of which the most profitable are physician's and dentist's offices, professional and technical services, specialty trade contracting, legal services. The typical business has $7 million in sales and 57 employees. With a 10% profit margin, this will place two business partners in the top 1%.\n\n\nThe remainder of the top 1% tends to be the classic professions: medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, finance, and corporate executive management.\n\n\nA correlation has been shown between increases in income and increases in worker satisfaction. Increasing worker satisfaction, however, is not solely a result of the increase in income: workers in more complex and higher level occupations tend to have attained higher levels of education and thus are more likely to have a greater degree of autonomy in the workplace.[54] Additionally, higher level workers with advanced degrees are hired to share their personal knowledge, to conceptualize, and to consult. Higher-level workers typically suffer less job alienation and reap not only external benefits in terms of income from their jobs, but also enjoy high levels of intrinsic motivation and satisfaction.[12][54]\n\n\nIn the United States, the highest earning occupational group is referred to as white collar professionals. Individuals in this occupational classification tend to report the highest job satisfaction and highest incomes. Defining income based on title of a profession can be misleading, given that a professional title may indicate the type of education received, but does not always correlate with the actual day to day income-generating endeavors that are pursued.\n\n\nSome sources cite the profession of physician in the United States as the highest paying,[12] Physician (MD and DO) and Dentist (DMD and DDS) compensation ranks as the highest median annual earnings of all professions. Median annual earnings ranged from $149,310 for general dentists and $156,010 for family physicians to $321,686 for anesthesiologists. Surgeons post a median annual income of $282,504.[55] However, the annual salary for Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) is projected quite differently based on source: Salary.com reports a median salary of $634,941,[56] while the U.S. Department of Labor in May 2004 reported the median as $140,350.[57] This is primarily due to a methodological difference in terms of which companies were surveyed. Overall annual earnings among the nation's top 25 professions ranged from the $70,000s to the $300,000s.\n\n\nIn addition to physicians, lawyers, physicists, and nuclear engineers were all among the nation's 20 highest paid occupations with incomes in excess of $78,410.[58] Some of the other occupations in the high five-figure range were economists with a median of $72,780,[59] mathematicians with $81,240,[60] financial managers with $81,880,[61] and software publishers with median annual earnings of $73,060.[62] The median annual earnings of wage-and-salary pharmacists in May 2006 were $94,520. The median annual earnings of wage-and-salary engineers in November 2011 were $90,000. The middle 50 percent earned between $83,180 and $108,140 a year (as in the Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–09 Edition by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Educational attainment in the United States\n\n![](image)\nMedian household and personal income by educational attainment\n![](image)\nIvy-Plus admissions rates vary with the income of the students' parents, with the acceptance rate of the top 0.1% income percentile being almost twice as much as other students.[63]\n\nEducational attainment plays a major factor in determining an individual's economic disposition. Personal income varied greatly according to an individual's education, as did household income.\n\n\nIncomes for those employed, full-time, year-round and over the age of twenty-five ranged from $20,826 ($17,422 if including those who worked part-time[9]) for those with less than a ninth grade education to $100,000 for those with professional degrees ($82,473 if including those who work part-time[9]). The median income for individuals with doctorates was $79,401 ($70,853 if including those who work part-time[9]).[64]\n\n\nThese statistics reveal that the majority of those employed full-time with professional or doctoral degrees are among the overall top 10% (15% if including those who work part-time) of income earners. Of those with a master's degree, nearly 50% were among the top quarter of income earners (top third if including those who work part-time).[9]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nIndividuals of a broad variety of religious backgrounds have become wealthy in America. However, the majority of these individuals follow Mainline Protestant denominations; Episcopalians[65] and Presbyterians are most prevalent.[66] According to a 2016 study by the Pew Research Center, Jewish again ranked as the most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 44% of Jews living in households with incomes of at least $100,000, followed by Hindu (36%), Episcopalians (35%), and Presbyterians (32%).[67] Owing to their numbers, more Catholics (13.3 million) reside in households with a yearly income of $100,000 or more than any other religious group.[67]\n\n\nAccording to the same study there is a correlation between education and income, about 77% of American Hindus have an undergraduate degree and according to a study in 2020, they are earning the highest with median income $137,000, followed by Jews (59%), Episcopalians (56%), and Presbyterians (47%).[68]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Racial inequality in the United States § Home ownership\n\n![](image)Percent of households with six figure incomes and individuals with incomes in the top 10%, exceeding $77,500\nRecent U.S. Census Bureau publications indicate a strong correlation between race and affluence. In the top household income quintile (households with incomes exceeding $91,200), Asian Americans and Whites were over represented, whereas Hispanics and African Americans were underrepresented.\n\n\nIn 2006, the household income for Asian Americans was, at $61,094, by far the highest,[69] exceeding that of Whites ($48,554) by 26%.[70] Over a quarter, 27.5%, of Asian American households had incomes exceeding $100,000, and another 40% had incomes of over $75,000.[71]\n\n\nAmong White households, who remained near the national median, 18.3% had six figure incomes, while 28.9% had incomes exceeding $75,000.[70] The percentages of households with incomes exceeding $100,000 and $75,000 were far below the national medians for Hispanic and African American households.[72] Among Hispanic households, for example, only 9% had six figure incomes, and 17% had incomes exceeding $75,000.[73] The race gap remained when considering personal income. In 2005, roughly 11% of Asian Americans[74] and 7% of White individuals[75] had six figure incomes, compared to 2.6% among Hispanics[76] and 2.3% among African Americans.[77]\n\n\nThe racial breakdowns of income brackets further illustrate the racial disparities associated with affluence. in 2005, 81.8% of all 114 million households were White (including White Hispanics),[70] 12.2% were African American,[72] 10.9% were Hispanic[73] and 3.7% were Asian American.[69][78]\n\n\nWhile White households are always near the national median due to Whites being by far the most prevalent racial demographic, the percentages of minority households with incomes exceeding $100,000 strayed considerably from their percentage of the overall population: Asian Americans, who represent the smallest surveyed racial demographic in the overall population, were found to be the prevalent minority among six figure income households.\n\n\nAmong the nearly twenty million households with six figure incomes, 86.9% were White,[70] 5.9% were Asian American,[69] 5.6% were Hispanic[73] and 5.5% were African American.[72] Among the general individual population *with earnings*, 82.1% were White,[75] 12.7% were Hispanic,[76] 11.0% were African American[77] and 4.6% were Asian American.[74]\n\n\nOf the top 10% of income earners, those nearly 15 million individuals with incomes exceeding $77,500, Whites and Asians were once again over-represented with the percentages of African Americans and Hispanics trailing behind considerably. Of the top 10% of earners, 86.7% were White.[75] Asian Americans were the prevalent minority, constituting 6.8% of top 10% income earners, nearly twice the percentage of Asian Americans among the general population.[74]\n\n\nHispanics, who were the prevalent minority in the general population of income earners, constituted only 5.2% of those in the top 10%,[76] with African Americans being the least represented with 5.1%.[77]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race\n | Overall median\n | High school\n | Some college\n | College graduate\n | Bachelor's degree\n | Master's degree\n | Doctoral degree\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population | All, age 25+ | 32,140 | 26,505 | 31,054 | 49,303 | 43,143 | 52,390 | 70,853\n |\n| Full-time workers, age 25–64 | 39,509 | 31,610 | 37,150 | 56,027 | 50,959 | 61,324 | 79,292\n |\n| White alone | All, age 25+ | 33,030 | 27,311 | 31,564 | 49,972 | 43,833 | 52,318 | 71,268\n |\n| Full-time workers, age 25–64 | 40,422 | 32,427 | 38,481 | 56,903 | 51,543 | 61,441 | 77,906\n |\n| Asian alone | All, age 25+ | 36,152 | 25,285 | 29,982 | 51,481 | 42,466 | 61,452 | 69,653\n |\n| Full-time workers, age 25–64 | 42,109 | 27,041 | 33,120 | 60,532 | 51,040 | 71,316 | 91,430\n |\n| African American | All, age 25+ | 27,101 | 22,379 | 27,648 | 44,534 | 41,572 | 48,266 | 61,894\n |\n| Full-time workers, age 25–64 | 32,021 | 26,230 | 32,392 | 47,758 | 45,505 | 52,858 | N/A\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino | All, age 25+ | 23,613 | 22,941 | 28,698 | 41,596 | 37,819 | 50,901 | 67,274\n |\n| Full-time workers, age 25–64 | 27,266 | 26,461 | 33,120 | 46,594 | 41,831 | 53,880 | N/A\n |\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, 2006[79]\n\n\n\n## Status and stratification[edit]\n\n\nEconomic well-being is often associated with high societal status, yet income and economic compensation are a function of scarcity and act as only one of a number of indicators of social class. It is in the interest of all of society that open positions are adequately filled with a competent occupant enticed to do his or her best.[12] As a result, an occupation that requires a scarce skill, the attainment of which is often documented through an educational degree, and entrusts its occupant with a high degree of influence will generally offer high economic compensation.\n\n\nTo put it another way, the high income is intended to ensure that the desired individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g. medical or graduate school) and complete their tasks with the necessary vigor[80] but differences in income may, however, be found among occupations of similar sociological nature: the median annual earnings of a physician were in excess of $150,000 in May 2004, compared to $95,000 for an attorney.[55][58] Both occupations require finely tuned and scarce skill sets and both are essential to the well-being of society, yet physicians out-earned attorneys and other upper middle class professionals by a wide margin as their skill-sets are deemed especially scarce.\n\n\nOverall, high status positions tend to be those requiring a scarce skill and are therefore commonly far better compensated than those in the middle of the occupational strata.[12][80]\n\n\n\n\n> ...It is essential that the duties of the positions be performed with the diligence that their importance requires. Inevitably, then, a society must have, first, some kind of rewards that it can use as inducements, and, second, some way of distributing these rewards differently according to positions. The rewards and their distribution become part of the social order... If the rights and perquisites of different positions in a society must be unequal, then society must be stratified... Hence every society... must differentiate persons... and must therefore possess a certain amount of institutionalized inequality.\n> \n> \n> — Kingsley Davis & Wilbert E. Moore, \"Some Principles of Stratification\", republished in *Social Class and Stratification*[80]\n> \n\n\nIt is important to note that the above is an ideal type, a simplified model or reality using optimal circumstances. In reality other factors such as discrimination based on race, ethnicity and gender as well as aggressive political lobbying by certain professional organizations also influence personal income. An individual's personal career decisions, as well as his or her personal connections within the nation's economic institutions, are also likely to have an effect on income, status and whether or not an individual may be referred to as affluent.[11]\n\n\nIn contemporary America it is a combination of all these factors, with scarcity remaining by far the most prominent one, which determine a person's economic compensation. Due to higher status professions requiring advanced and thus less commonly found skill sets (including the ability to supervise and work with a considerable autonomy), these professions are better compensated through the means of income, making high status individuals affluent, depending on reference group.[12]\n\n\nWhile the two paragraphs above only describe the relationship between status and personal income, household income is also often used to infer status. As a result, the dual income phenomenon presents yet another problem in equating affluence with high societal status. As mentioned earlier in the article, 42% of households have two or more income earners, and 76% of households with six figure incomes have two or more income earners.[13] Furthermore, people are most likely to marry their professional and societal equals.\n\n\nIt therefore becomes apparent that the majority of households with incomes exceeding the six figure mark are the result of an economic as well as personal union between two economic equals. Today, two nurses, each making $55,000 a year, can easily out-earn a single attorney who makes the median of $95,000 annually.[58][81] Despite household income rising drastically through the union of two economic equals, neither individual has advanced his or her function and position within society. Yet the household (not the individual) may have become more affluent, assuming an increase in household members does not offset the dual-income derived gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic class models\n| Dennis Gilbert, 2002\n | William Thompson & Joseph Hickey, 2005\n | Leonard Beeghley, 2004\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Class\n | Typical characteristics\n | Class\n | Typical characteristics\n | Class\n | Typical characteristics\n |\n| Capitalist class (1%)\n | Top-level executives, high-rung politicians, heirs.

The 400 highest tax payers in the nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding $87,000,000. Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for any other. As a result, the gap between those who make less than one and half million dollars annually (99.9% of households) and those who make more (0.1%) has been steadily increasing, prompting *The New York Times* to proclaim that the \"Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind.\"[82]\n\n\nThe income disparities within the top 1.5% are quite drastic.[83] While households in the top 1.5% of households had incomes exceeding $250,000, 443% above the national median, their incomes were still 2200% lower than those of the top 0.1% of households.\n\n\n\n## Wealth statistics[edit]\n\n\n* Family net worth\n* ![U.S. mean family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)](image)\n\nU.S. mean family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)\n* ![U.S. median family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)](image)\n\nU.S. median family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)\n\n\nThe total value of all U.S. household wealth in 2000 was approximately $44 trillion.
