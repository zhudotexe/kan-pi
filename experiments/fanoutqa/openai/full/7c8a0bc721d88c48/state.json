For 2022, the list was published on December 1, calculated with data from November 20, 2021 to November 12, 2022.[1] At the number-one position was Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which spent 5 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It accumulated a total of 91 weeks on the chart, which is the longest-charting song in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nThe 2022 Billboard Hot 100 Year-End list is also notable for being one of five Billboard Year-End lists that featured 14 songs that appeared in the previous year (in this case 2021's) repeat onto this list.

A sleeper hit, it is the band's signature song and biggest hit single to date. In addition to reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart and being a top-five hit in several other European countries, it reached number one in Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Switzerland and the United States, where it topped the *Billboard* Hot 100 for five weeks in early 2022 after a record-breaking 59-week climb to number one. At 91 weeks, it is the longest charting song on the Hot 100 of all time, surpassing \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd.[4] By September 2022, the song had accumulated more than two billion streams on Spotify.[5] At the 2022 Brit Awards, \"Heat Waves\" was nominated for Best British Single.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Composition and other versions[edit]\n\n\nBayley stated that \"Heat Waves\" \"is about loss and longing, and ultimately realising you are unable to save something\".[7] He said that \"Also, this song is about memories and it's very nostalgic, and sometimes people feel more of that in the winter. Maybe that's part of the reason this song's hung around for so bloody long \u2013 everyone's locked inside and trapped in their own thoughts.\"[8]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" starts on a high and then drops into despair before rising again for a cheerful, optimistic finale, much like the crests and troughs of a real wave. Bayley came up with the chords one day while playing around on the guitar. He wrote the lyrics in just an hour, prompted by the death of a close friend whose birthday was in June.[8]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the podcast Song Exploder featured an interview with Dave Bayley that specifically discussed the creation of \"Heat Waves\". He says \"weirdly, Johnny Depp was the first person to hear this song.\" In it, he says that after writing/performing the song late at night alone in the studio, he decided to go home when he realized a stranger was sitting behind him. It was Depp who had been working in another studio.[9]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" is an example of *Dreamland*'s incorporation of hip hop and electropop elements into Glass Animals' sound. It and \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" rejects the band's acoustic percussion and marimbas in favor of 808 sounds and skittering hi-hats.[10] *NME*'s Hannah Mylrea categorized the song as \"earnest R&B run through the Glass Animals filter\", and *Pitchfork*'s Ian Cohen argued its guitars \"could be plucked from any number of 'wavy hip-hop' sample packs meant to emulate Frank Ocean's 'Ivy' on a bedroom producer's budget\".[11][12] A major theme on *Dreamland* is the pursuit of brief pleasures to cope with the hardships of life, such as lust for others. On \"Heat Waves\", Bayley sings repeatedly, \"Sometimes all I think about is you/Late nights in the middle of June.\"[10]\n\n\nThe band ran a remix competition for the track, with 19-year-old British producer Shakur Ahmad winning and having his remix issued by the band, alongside a remix by American DJ Diplo in August 2020.[13] Another remix is a collaboration with American rapper Iann Dior. A piano Simlish version was recorded by Bayley for *The Sims 4*, and was featured in a limited-time \"Sims Sessions\" in-game music event in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" was met with positive reviews upon release, with music critics such as Robin Murray, Owen Richards, and Rob Waters praising the song as a \"stunningly effective\" pop track, \"built on a delicious groove and utilising very conventional lyrical structures\" while containing enough elements unique to Glass Animals to entice more listeners to them.[15][16][17] *No Ripcord*'s Ethan Gordon generally found *Dreamland* \"as momentarily annoying as it is infinitely forgettable\" due to its combination of trap percussion and synthesizers being mostly \"strained and unpleasant\"; however, he considered \"Heat Waves\" to be the \"strongest\" mixture of those sounds.[18]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nA sleeper hit, \"Heat Waves\" is the group's most successful single to date. It was voted into first place on the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020, making Glass Animals the first British act to top the countdown since Mumford & Sons won the 2009 poll with \"Little Lion Man\". It then spent seven weeks at the top of the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and was later certified as the number one song for 2021 in Australia. It reached No. 1 in March 2021, stayed there until April 2021, and returned to that position in March 2022.[19] It is the first song ever to stay in the Australian top 10 for more than a year, staying there for 85 weeks. It also reached the top 20 in several territories.\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Heat Waves\" peaked at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100 chart dated 12 March 2022, completing a record-breaking 59-week climb to the position.[20] It dethroned *Encanto*'s \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" after five consecutive weeks at number one. \"Heat Waves\" previously reached number 10 on the Hot 100 in its 42nd week on the chart, breaking the record for the longest climb to the top 10, surpassing Carrie Underwood's \"Before He Cheats\" (2007).[21] The song also reached the top five in its 51st week on the chart, breaking the record previously set by Gabby Barrett's \"I Hope\" (2020).[22] The song was in the top 10 up to its 80th week on the chart. No other song in the chart's history has reached such longevity.[23][24] This longevity has been attributed to, among other things, a popular fan fiction[25] which shipped Dream and GeorgeNotFound, two YouTubers who play *Minecraft*.[24][26]\n\n\nOn the UK Singles Chart the single originally peaked at number 19 in the first half of 2021. After its inclusion in the EA Sports video game *FIFA 21* and wide usage as backing music in various TikTok videos, the song re-entered at number 18 in September 2021 and continued to climb into the top 5.[27][28][29] The viral video also helped the song climb back up 31 places to number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart in its 41st week on the chart, before peaking at number 5. The track has spent a total of 22 weeks in the top 10 to date, the most among tracks in 2021.[30] The song reached number one on the *Billboard* Global 200 in the issue dated 5 March 2022,[31] and also reached the same peak on the Global Excl. US chart.[32]\n\n\n\n## Music videos[edit]\n\n\nA lyric video heavily based on the vaporwave imagery was released through Glass Animals official YouTube account on 20 July 2020. The video was produced by designer Notnarcs. It gained almost 30 million views during its first year on YouTube. As of June 2023, the lyric video on YouTube has amassed over 126 million views.\n\n\nThe official music video for the song, directed by Colin Read, premiered on 29 June 2020. It shows frontman Dave Bayley walking through the streets of East London[33] pulling a wagon stacked with several TVs, filmed by his neighbours using their phones during the COVID-19 lockdowns, before arriving at a venue, setting the TVs up on a stage that then display his bandmates playing their instruments, and singing the rest of the song. Bayley called it \"a love letter to live music and the culture and togetherness surrounding it\".[34] As of August 2023, the music video has amassed over 600 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n\n## Track

The band's line-up consists of Dave Bayley (vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums, songwriting), Drew MacFarlane (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Edmund Irwin-Singer (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Joe Seaward (drums).\n\n\nTheir first album, *Zaba* (2014), spawned the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified platinum in the U.S. Their second full album, *How to Be a Human Being*, received positive reviews and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. The third, *Dreamland*, peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US *Billboard* 200.\n\n\nThe band is best known for their biggest hit single \"Heat Waves\", which went viral on TikTok. It reached number one in Australia in February 2021 and was voted number one on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020. The song surpassed two billion streams on Spotify by September 2022,[2] and eventually reached number one on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100 and number five on the UK Singles Chart. At the 2022 Brit Awards, the band were nominated for two Brit Awards (Best British Rock Act and \"Heat Waves\" for Best British Single).[3] They received their first Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category at the 2022 Grammy Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 2010\u20132015: Formation, *Zaba*, and various EPs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glass Animals performing in 2014\nAll four members of the band met in 2010 at St Edward's School in Oxford.[4][5] The band's lead singer and songwriter Dave Bayley, who moved to the U.S. at a young age due to his father's job, grew up in Massachusetts and Texas before returning to England at the age of 13.[4][6] He attended St Edwards on a music scholarship and was introduced to Drew MacFarlane, who would become the band's guitarist and backing vocalist; the two bonded over the fact that they were both Englishmen who had spent their childhoods in the U.S.[7] MacFarlane then introduced Bayley to Edmund Irwin-Singer, who joined as the band's bassist, and Joe Seaward, who joined as its drummer.[4]\n\n\nOn 28 May 2012, the band released their debut EP *Leaflings*, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of XL Recordings (part of the Beggars Group of labels).\n\n\nIn 2013, the band released *Black Mambo / Exxus EP* in Europe, and *Glass Animals EP* in the US.[8] The *Glass Animals* EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".\n\n\nIn 2014, the band made their first tour of the U.S. and performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Gooey\", \"Pools\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer Tei Shi.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAll five singles were included on the band's debut album, *Zaba*, which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on *Late Night with Seth Meyers* on 9 October 2014[9] and again on *Late Show with David Letterman* on 24 February 2015,[10] and toured extensively after *Zaba*, visiting both hemispheres and playing over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold-out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold-out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the Midland Theatre in Kansas City.\n\n\nA collaboration with American rapper Joey Bada$$, titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015.\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132019: *How to Be a Human Being*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bayley in November 2018\nOn 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album *How to Be a Human Being*.[11] \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on *Billboard*'s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.[12] A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016. The band also created a website based on the character from \"Life Itself\".\n\n\nOn 25 July, a second single from the album, \"Youth\", was released along with its music video.[12] This song was also used as a soundtrack in the popular football video game by EA Sports, *FIFA 17*. Four days before the release of the album, on 22 August, the band released a third single, \"Season 2 Episode 3\", about a girl who \"spends her entire time watching TV, lounging around, not doing anything, being high, eating mayonnaise from a jar\".[13]\n\n\nThe full album *How to Be a Human Being* was released on 26 August 2016 by Wolf Tone and Caroline International in Europe, and Harvest Records in the United States. It was inspired by stories of strangers that Bayley met on tour,[6] with each song telling a different story from a different perspective.\n\n\nIn July 2018, drummer Joe Seaward was seriously injured when he was hit by a lorry while cycling in Dublin. Seaward's accident and recovery resulted in the band cancelling their remaining tour dates for rest of the year.[14]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u2013present: *Dreamland*[edit]\n\n\nAfter touring for *How to Be a Human Being*, the band released two singles; \"Tokyo Drifting\", a duet with Denzel Curry, on 14 November 2019,[1] and \"Your Love (D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu)\" on 19 February 2020.[15] On 1 May 2020, the band released a single named \"Dreamland\", and announced an album of the same name to be released on 10 July 2020.[16] The beginnings of Dreamland originated after drummer Joe Seaward's bike accident in Dublin. While spending long hours by Seaward's side in the hospital as he recovered, Bayley started \"writing down memories and searching for more memories.\" Those memories eventually evolved into the nostalgic and very personal *Dreamland* album full of references to Bayley's childhood and other points in his life.[2]\n\n\nOn 28 June, the band announced that the album had been delayed, to \"keep focus on the Black Lives Matter movement and the discussions taking place around racism and police brutality around the world.\"[17] In the lead-up to *Dreamland*, Glass Animals launched an open-source website where fans could access and download song samples, artwork, and other content related to the album.[2] *Dreamland* was released on 7 August 2020 via Polydor Records. In an interview with *Atwood Magazine*, Bayley explained: \"I guess the goal with this record was to make something that was incredibly honest and incredibly us.\"[18] The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number two. \"Heat Waves\" was included on the *FIFA 21* soundtrack.\n\n\nOn 23 January 2021, \"Heat Waves\" placed first on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020 in Australia, with \"Tangerine\" placing at 18th and \"Your Love (D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu)\" at 51st. The following month, \"Heat Waves\" reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart.[19] In April 2021, \"Tokyo Drifting\" was featured in a television commercial released by Peloton as part of their Champions Collection campaign.[20]\n\n\nA bonus track and single, \"I Don\u2019t Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance)\", was included on the *FIFA 22* soundtrack.[21] After a record-breaking 59-week climb on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, \"Heat Waves\" topped the chart for the week ending 12 March 2022.[22]\n\n\n\n## Musical style[edit]\n\n\nGlass Animals' musical style has been described as indie rock,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29] psychedelic pop,[30][31][32] indie pop,[33][34][35] electronic rock,[36] and alternative pop.[37]\n\n\n\n## Band members[edit]\n\n\n* Dave Bayley \u2013 lead vocals,

The song was written by Styles alongside its producers Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson.\n\n\n\"As It Was\" was widely acclaimed by music critics and entered at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming Styles's second number-one single after \"Sign of the Times\" in April 2017. \"As It Was\" spent ten weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming the longest-running number-one and best-selling single of 2022 in his home country. It also became his second number one single in the US; the song spent 15 non-consecutive weeks atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming the longest-running US number one by a UK act and the fifth-longest-running number one in the chart's history.\n\n\n\"As It Was\" became a huge worldwide hit topping the charts in 45 countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nHarry Styles announced the title of his third studio album as *Harry's House* on 23 March 2022, unveiling its artwork, a 40-second trailer and the album's release date as 20 May 2022.[1][2] Five days later, he announced the title of its lead single as \"As It Was\", along with pictures of him in a \"sequined, sleeveless red outfit\" and its release date as 1 April 2022.[3][4][5] Simultaneously, posters bearing the lyrics \"It's not the same as it was\" and a picture of Styles sitting on a big ball appeared in various cities.[6] He released a teaser of the music video on 30 March, which included an \"energetic drum beat\" and a \"sunny electric guitar riff\", and depicted him in a red jumpsuit spinning in circles atop a motorised turntable.[7]\n\n\n\n## Lyrics and composition[edit]\n\n\nMusic critics described the song as a guitar-driven synth-pop and new wave track, a noticeable shift from Styles's rock-oriented sounds.[8][9][10][11][12] Chris Willman of *Variety* noted that it takes heavy inspiration from Depeche Mode and a-ha, while also suggesting that it adopted a style similar to the Weeknd's 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\".[9] *EUPHORIA* magazine felt that Styles was inspired by James Bay's 2018 single \"Pink Lemonade\", adding that the two songs sound \"eerily similar\".[13] Lyrically, \"As It Was\" is rooted in personal transitions and depicts a feeling of loss and loneliness.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[15] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[16] |\n\n\n\"As It Was\" received critical acclaim. *NME*'s Rhian Daly gave the song five out of five stars, describing it as \"not a million miles away from where *Fine Line* left off, but hardly retreading old ground.\" According to Daly, the track suggests *Harry's House* will solidify Styles \"as one of the current pop landscapes' greats\".[16] Beau Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* also rated the song five stars and called it \"one of his very best\", writing, \"Many will pore over the gossipy, self-referential lyrics, but Styles's song is for everyone: an effervescent, high-tempo hit to have you clicking your heels.\"[15] In his review for *Rolling Stone*, Rob Sheffield regarded \"As It Was\" as one of Styles's most \"emotionally powerful\" songs, calling it a \"daring change-up\" and a \"straight-from-the-heart cry that's also an irresistible dance-floor challenge.\"[10] Sahar Ghadirian of *Clash* magazine deemed it a \"powerhouse\" and Styles \"at his most vulnerable\". Ghadirian appreciated the \"dream fusion\" of synth-pop with electro rock and commented that the bells end the song on \"a euphoric high\".[17] Thania Garcia of *Variety* magazine described the song as being \"new wave-inspired\".[18]\n\n\n*Evening Standard* reviewer Jochan Embley meanwhile found the track inferior to the singer's previous singles \"Watermelon Sugar\" and \"Adore You\", but wrote that Styles and his collaborators \"still know how to make an instantly enjoyable tune\".[19] Olivia Horn of *Pitchfork* was less impressed and bemoaned that the song \"winds down without any real payoff\", citing the circuitousness of the lyrics as \"a frequent shortcoming in Styles' songwriting.\"[20]\n\n\n*Entertainment Weekly* named \"As It Was\" as the best song of 2022: \"The synths gallop like excitable ponies while his warm-wash vocals swoop and dip, a sweet little slice of life-support disco for the lonely.\"[21] *USA Today* also chose it as the best song of the year: \"At first, it sounds like a generically pretty pop song. But then you understand Styles' longing for the perfect something that was yanked away, his dreamy vocals taking on a sadness as he recalls that blissful bubble and resigns himself with a sigh to his current reality. The giggly opening by his goddaughter, pillowy '80s-rooted synths, tubular bells and urging beat contradict his pensiveness.\"[22] *Billboard* ranked it at number 3 on their \"The 100 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"Coming in at a lean 2:47, \"As It Was\" serves as a broader anthem about how nothing is \"the same as it was\" before the pandemic, but on a micro level, it turns out Styles isn't the same either as he grapples with fame and the realization that \"he's no good alone\" when left to his own devices and pills.\"[23]\n\n\nBBC ranked it at number 3 on their \"25 of the best songs released in 2022\" list: \"As It Was is a vapour trail of a song, silvery and airborne, as Harry Styles searches for meaning amidst break-ups and loneliness and personal turmoil.\"[24] *NME* ranked it at number 3 on their \"The 50 best songs of 2022\" list: \"It's hard not to tumble into the vast emotional depths of 'As It Was' and look beyond everything else that made this song such a triumph. Change is a constant beneath the track's heart-raising BPM and twinkling melodies: here, Harry Styles' empathetic songwriting saw him fight for stability amid breakups and personal upheavals, finding strength in a renewed relationship with himself.\"[25] *The Guardian* ranked it at number 5 on their \"The 20 best songs of 2022\" list: \"Occupying the slim valley between A-ha's Take On Me and Vampire Weekend, As It Was delivers bruised-peach hurt, sophisticated languor from the back seat of a tastefully expensive car. He can sing something as vague as \"In this world, it's just us / You know it's not the same as it was\" and make you feel that he really means it\"[26] *i-D* ranked it at number 10 on their \"The 100 best songs of 2022\" list: \"For an artist reckoning with blinding attention towards his public persona, this infectious, upbeat song about loneliness and change felt like a balm both for the artist and his fans.\"[27]\n\n\n*NPR* ranked it at number 12 on their \"100 Best Songs Of 2022\" list: \"Like a fling who would have never dated you in real life saying arrivederci at summer's end, this song is by turns forlorn, resigned, apologetic and a little caddish. Its slippery nostalgia is grounded in a synth line evoking the New Romantic era of Styles' parents' youth and in the singer's cool, bossa nova-ish croon, which sounds like the way it feels when that departing lover wistfully strokes your hair. The Easter-eggy verses matter to fans, but the chorus is what made \"As It Was\" so sticky in 2022: It renders regret comfortable, a service everyone needs in a time of chronic heartbreak.\"[28] *Complex* ranked it at number 27 on their \"50 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" is a beautiful, mesmerizing record that lives up to all the buzz it's generated on TikTok (and everywhere else on the internet and radio). It carries an energetic tone thanks to the uptempo instrumentation, and Harry Styles adds layers of emotion with his soft vocals. \"As It Was\" is a fun and danceable record that continues to demonstrate his power as one of the biggest pop stars in the world.\"[29] *Paste* ranked it at number 29 on their \"The 50 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"Our first glimpse into Harry Styles' newest era, where he is fully immersed in his own flamboyant intricacies, the song is a thoughtful rumination on the exhaustion that stems from not enough love and too much fame.\"[30]\n\n\n*The Fader* ranked it at number 33 on their \"The 100 best songs of 2022\" list: \"On *Harry's House* lead single \"As It Was,\" the singer hits an effervescent pitch both sonically and conceptually, expressing a willingness to embrace introspection while delivering one of the most textured performances in his loaded discography.\"[31] *Pitchfork* ranked it at number 100 on their \"The 100 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" is the kind of twinkly little confection that would easily get the indie kids pogoing at any local DIY dance night at any point in the last two decades. It just happens to have been recorded by one of the biggest pop stars in the world in 2022 instead of, say, the Strokes twenty years earlier. \"You know it's not the same as it was,\" Harry Styles sighs, giving a nod to the easy bait of nostalgia. A pointillist synth line tap dances through the song, and all over that nagging pandemic-era malaise we're all desperately trying to shake. Resistance is futile.\"[32]\n\n\n*Associated Press* placed it on their \"Top Songs of 2022\" list: \"The song is deceptively upbeat with a jingly synth-pop beat and a little kid's voice as the intro and wedding bells at the end. But the lyrics are self-referentially melancholic as he accepts the reality of change that even he is not quite ready for.\"[33] *Esquire* placed it on their \"The 45 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" was Harry Styles first single this year, and it did not disappoint. This glittering track fuels nostalgia as Styles sings about life which is, of course, always changing. (Reality bites!)\"[34]\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect year-end rankings\n| Publication\n | List\n | Rank\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Billboard** | The 100 Best Songs of 2022: Staff List\n | 3\n | [35]\n |\n| *Consequence of Sound* | Top 50 Songs of 2022\n | 9\n | [36]\n |\n| *DIY magazine* | DIY's tracks of 2022\n | 12\n | [37]\n |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | The 10 best songs of 2022\n | 1\n | [38]\n |\n| *Esquire* | The 45 Best Songs of 2022 (So Far)\n | N/A\n | [39]\n |\n| *Exclaim* | Exclaim!'s 25 Best Songs of 2022\n | 8\n | [40]\n |\n| *NME* | Top 50 Best Songs of 2022\n | 3\n | [41]\n |\n| *Pitchfork* | The 100 Best Songs of 2022\n | 100\n | [42]\n |\n| *Rolling Stone* | The 100 Best Songs of 2022\n | 9\n | [43]\n |\n| *Slate* | Plus the best songs\n | N/A\n | [44]\n |\n| *The Guardian* | The 20 Best Songs of 2022\n | 5\n | [45]\n |\n| *UPROXX* | The Best Songs Of 2022\n | N/A\n | [46]\n |\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" was an immediate success; it earned the Guinness World Records title for the most streamed track on Spotify within 24 hours by a male artist, and broke the Apple Music streaming record for most first-day streams for a 2022 release.[47][48] The song also opened atop the *Billboard* Global 200 with the greatest global streaming week of 2022, becoming Styles's first number-one on the tally.[49]\n\n\nIn the UK, \"As It Was\" became Styles's second solo number-one on the singles chart, debuting with the biggest sales and streaming weeks of any single in 2022.[50] It spent ten weeks at number one on the UK singles chart, becoming the longest-running number one of the year in the UK.[51] It became the most-streamed track (149.6 million streams), most physically purchased (12,000 units), most digitally downloaded (47,000 units) and overall, best-selling (1.3 million equivalent units) track in the UK in 2022, as of October\u00a02022[update].[52]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" entered at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming Styles' second number-one single after \"Watermelon Sugar\" (2019).[53] The song garnered the most single-day streams on Spotify in the United States, surpassing Olivia Rodrigo's \"Drivers License\" (2021).[54] After the single's debut at No. 1, \"As It Was\" fell out of the No. 1 position and returned multiple times between April and September 2022; when it returned to No. 1 for the week ending 3 September 2022, it became the first song ever to have five separate runs in the top position.[55] \"As It Was\" spent 15 weeks atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming the longest-running US number one by a UK act, the second longest-running No. 1 with no accompanying artists (i.e. a solo-billed song) and the fifth longest running number-one in the chart's history.[56][57]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" spent 18 weeks at number one on the Canadian Hot 100[58] and peaked at number one in Australia,[59] Austria,[60] Belgium,[61] Croatia,[62] Denmark,[63] Germany,[64] Greece,[65] Ireland,[66] Israel,[67] Lithuania,[68] the Netherlands,[69] New Zealand,[70] Slovakia,[71] Sweden,[72] and Switzerland.[73]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" ranked as the most popular song on Spotify and the second most popular song on Apple Music in 2022.[74]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video for \"As It Was\" was released alongside the song.[75] In the clip, Styles joins dancer Mathilde Lin on a turning platform and performs choreography by Yoann Bourgeois[76] in the Barbican to release negative emotions.[8] The video was filmed in London: apart from the Barbican Centre, it was also filmed at Lindley Hall near the Houses of Parliament, and the penguin pool at London Zoo.[77] It was directed by Tanu Muino, who stated that directing for Styles was \"a bucket list dream come true\" but, on the second day of shooting, Muino's home country of Ukraine was invaded by Russia, rendering the process a \"bittersweet\" experience; nevertheless, Muino and her team from Ukraine \"poured so much love into this video and you can see it on screen. It will be a music video I will never forget and now I can happily retire.\" Nevertheless, Muino continued her filmmaking work afterwards.[75] On YouTube, the video has received over 630 million views and 7.6 million likes as of November 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Organization\n | Award\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n |

It was released through Grade A Productions and Columbia Records on 9 July 2021, as the lead single (sixth overall) from Laroi's reloaded mixtape, *F\\*ck Love 3: Over You*. Laroi and Bieber wrote the song with Haan, FnZ members Finatik & Zac, and producers Cashmere Cat, Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin. The song marks the second collaboration between the two artists, following Bieber's song, \"Unstable\", a track from his sixth studio album, *Justice* (2021).\n\n\n\"Stay\" reached number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming Laroi's first chart-topping single and Bieber's eighth, and additionally topped the *Billboard* Global 200. Furthermore, it reached number one in 21 other countries, including their respective natives Australia and Canada, along with Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, and Sweden. It also peaked within the top ten in 18 other countries. At the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, the song won the ARIA Award for Best Pop Release, which resulted in Laroi and Bieber both winning the ARIA Award for Best Artist.[1] At the APRA Music Awards of 2022, the song won the award for Song of the Year.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 September 2020, Laroi shared a snippet of the song on an Instagram live stream, followed by a longer snippet in better quality that was previewed on a live stream from Rolling Loud on 29 October 2020. Bieber's contribution to the song was revealed on 31 May 2021. The song leaked in full on a Discord server on 2 June 2021.[3]\n\n\n\"Stay\" marks Laroi's first major single release as a lead artist in 2021 and Bieber's first major single as a lead artist since the release of his second extended play, *Freedom*, which was released in April 2021. On 3 June 2021, Scooter Braun, who has been Bieber's manager from the start of his career, also became Laroi's manager, until Laroi left and joined Adam Leber at Rebel Management on 27 September 2021.[4]\n\n\nLaroi had the song for about a year before its release. He created the song while spending time with producers Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin at Slatkin's house. Puth played the melody of the song on the keyboard, but Laroi ended up liking it and wanted to get it in production software Pro Tools to use it to create a song. He felt that \"it was probably the most organic way of making a song I've ever done \u2013 ever\". Laroi thought Bieber \"would sound perfect\", so he went to the studio at which Bieber records; they finished recording the song, but Bieber was hesitant about whether his vocals sounded good or not.[5]\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Stay\"\n\n\nA short 30-second audio sample of \"Stay\", where the song reaches its climax as Laroi and Bieber's voices join together in the last chorus.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Stay\" is a fast-paced pop rap, pop rock, and synth-pop song.[6][7][8][9] It is set in the key of D\u266d major and incorporates piano keys, heavy drums, and \"splattering\" synths.[6][9][10] The upward-darting keyboard riff, made on a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer owned by Slatkin, serves as the song's spine and eventually becomes the chorus melody.[11][12] Over a repeated melodic cell, Laroi and Bieber switch between head voice and chest voice on a minor sixth.[13] Jon Caramanica of *The New York Times* described the track as a \"hyper-slick\" hybridization of new wave and pop-punk.[14] Some critics found similarities between it and the music from Bieber's sixth studio album, *Justice* (2021). Justin Curto from *Vulture* compared the song's sound to *Justice* single \"Hold On\" and album tracks \"Die for You\" and \"Somebody\".[15][16] *Stereogum*'s Chris DeVille characterised it as \"[p]ost-SoundCloud pop-rap as effervescent *Justice*-style '80s pop\".[17]\n\n\nThe \"heartbreak-fueled\" lyrics to \"Stay\" enforce Laroi's toxic behaviour as he sets up a story about a troubled relationship where he is at fault.[18][19] In the chorus, he sings about his broken promises before begging for his partner to stay with him: \"I do the same thing I told you that I never would / I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could.\"[13][19][20] Robert Rowat of CBC Music interpreted the lines as \"an admission of weakness, if not a promise to be better\".[13] Bieber's verse echoes similar sentiments as he belts out lyrics about being unable to live without his loved one: \"When I'm away from you, I miss your touch / You're the reason I believe in love.\"[9][20][21] The song reaches its climax as Laroi and Bieber's voices join in the last chorus.[22]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 June 2021, Laroi and Bieber hinted at another collaboration. Leading up to its release, the two artists both teased the song multiple times on their respective social media accounts by posting snippets and teasing the lyrics.[23][24] Laroi also had previously stated on social media that Ron Perry, the label boss of Columbia Records would not release the song, to which Laroi asked his fans to repeatedly spam Perry on Instagram, which would hopefully change his mind into releasing it.[25][26] Laroi posted a picture of him at a basketball game on Instagram on 27 June 2021, holding a piece of paper that wrote the song title and the then-questionable release date, to which Puth teased his involvement of the song by commenting \"Yessssssssss\".[27] Three days later, Laroi shared a pre-order link in order to reveal the cover art, which would be posted the following day.[28]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe song has received generally positive reviews. Caramanica found \"Stay\" to be \"[b]racingly effective\", considering it a more effective pairing of Laroi and Bieber than their previous collaboration on \"Unstable\" from the latter's sixth studio album, *Justice*.[14] Tyler Jenke from *Rolling Stone Australia* wrote that \"the slick new tune\" is \"undoubtedly one that lives up [to] the hype\".[29] Jordan Rose of *Complex* believed that the track has Laroi and Bieber \"leaning into their strengths\".[30] Alex Zidel from *HotNewHipHop* felt that the song is \"every bit as infectious as [one] would expect\" and thought of it to be \"a solid pop offering for the summer\".[18] Jason Lipshutz of *Billboard* opined that the song \"sounds like it should push [Laroi] to a new level\" of stardom.[31] *Uproxx* contributing writer Carolyn Droke stated that the \"buoyant track['s]\" combination of \"a euphoric chorus and a driving beat\" will make it \"the next song of the summer\".[32] Rowat commended Laroi and Bieber's partnership as \"one of the year's best surprises\" and said that the song \"capitalizes on both singers' skills as falsettists\".[13] DeVille described the song as \"maniacally catchy\" and thought it musically feels like Laroi \"blasting off into a new frontier of crossover success\".[11] Curto called the track \"a high-energy, synth-filled pop banger\".[16] However, he later criticised the song for being \"some of Laroi's most anonymous work yet\" and concluded that \"it could just as easily be a hit for the Weeknd or Post Malone\".[15]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations for \"Stay\"\n| Year\n | Organization\n | Award\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | MTV Video Music Awards | Song of Summer | Nominated\n | [33] |\n| ARIA Music Awards | Best Artist | Won\n | [34] |\n| Best Pop Release | Won\n |\n| 2022\n | Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Music Collaboration\n | Won\n | [35] |\n| APRA Music Awards | Song of the Year\n | Won\n | [36] |\n| *Billboard* Music Awards | Top Hot 100 Song | Won\n | [37] |\n| Top Streaming Song | Won\n |\n| Top Radio Song | Nominated\n |\n| Top Collaboration | Won\n |\n| Top *Billboard* Global 200 Song\n | Won\n |\n| Top *Billboard* Global (Excl.

It stayed at number two for six weeks and became Laroi's joint-highest-charting song in the UK along with \"Without You\".[51]\n\n\nIn Ireland, \"Stay\" entered at number three on the Irish Singles Chart as the week's highest new entry.

Adele wrote the song with its producer, Greg Kurstin. Columbia Records released it as the album's lead single on 15 October 2021. It is a torch song and ballad which places emphasis on Adele's vocals, set over progressively louder-growing piano instrumentation. In its lyrics, she addresses her divorce and pleads for forgiveness and understanding from her son, ex-husband, and herself.\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics, who discussed it in relation to Adele's previous music and praised her vocals and the lyrics. At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, the song won Best Pop Solo Performance from its four nominations. It was nominated for several other awards and won the 2022 Brit Award for Song of the Year. \"Easy on Me\" reached number one on the charts in several countries. It became Adele's longest-running chart topper in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nXavier Dolan directed the music video for \"Easy on Me\", which was released on 15 October 2021. It references several previous Adele videos and depicts her moving out of the same house where the \"Hello\" (2015) music video was filmed. She performed the song at the 23rd NRJ Music Awards, on her television specials, and at the concert residency Weekends with Adele. Artists including Kanye West, Chloe Bailey, and Keith Urban sang cover versions of it.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![Greg Kurstin in a striped t-shirt and jacket](image)Greg Kurstin (*pictured in 2017*) produced and co-wrote \"Easy on Me\".\nGreg Kurstin produced and co-wrote three tracks on Adele's third studio album, *25* (2015),[1] which included the song \"Hello\". It was released as the lead single from the album and reached number one in 36 countries, and its music video broke the Vevo record for most single-day views.[2][3] She kept a low profile after completing the associated concert tour, Adele Live 2016, in 2017.[4] Adele had begun working on the follow-up album by the following year.[5] She filed for divorce from her husband, Simon Konecki, in September 2019,[6] which inspired the album. After experiencing anxiety, Adele undertook therapy sessions and mended her estranged relationship with her father.[7] The divorce's effect on her son plagued Adele during the following years. She decided to have regular conversations with him, which she recorded following advice from her therapist.[7][8] These conversations inspired Adele's return to the studio, and the album took shape as a body of work that would explain to her son why she left his father.[7]\n\n\nAdele wrote \"Easy on Me\" with its producer, Kurstin.[9] She conceived the song's verses while taking a shower. Adele's friends would tell her to \"go easy on yourself, don't beat yourself up too much about your decisions\". The advice resonated with her, and she decided that she had to be more gentle with herself.[10] Adele's friends were unimpressed by an initial snippet of it but she claimed that they appreciated her patience.[11] Three songs were in contention for release as the lead single from *30* (2021). She eventually chose \"Easy on Me\" because it had a \"soaring chorus\" and \"just felt like a me song\"; she saw it as the right song for her return after the hiatus.[12] Adele wanted to avoid releasing something that would propel her to more stardom: \"There isn't a bombastic 'Hello,' But I don't want another song like that. That song catapulted me in fame to another level that I don't want to happen again.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" is three minutes and 44 seconds long.[13] Kurstin produced the song and engineered it with Alex Pasco and Julian Burg. Kurstin plays bass guitar, kick drum, and piano. Tom Elmhirst helmed the song's mixing at Electric Lady Studios in New York, and Randy Merrill handled mastering at Sterling Sound in New Jersey.[9]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" is a torch song and ballad[14] which places emphasis on Adele's vocals over piano instrumentation.[15] The song opens with a gentle piano, which intensifies as it progresses, leading into the vocals.[16][17] Adele's voice mimics this according to *The Guardian*'s Alexis Petridis, as it \"sounds initially wounded, then soars\".[17] The song almost completely eschews the use of percussion instruments,[14][18] but a bass drum and bass guitar are played during its latter half.[19] In the chorus, Adele delivers the song title in elongated vocal runs and stretches the \"e\" sound through eight different musical notes.[19] Mikael Wood of the *Los Angeles Times* described her performance as \"soaring yet slightly crinkly around the edges\".[20]\n\n\nIn the lyrics, Adele addresses her divorce and asks for forgiveness and understanding from her son,[21][22] ex-husband,[19][23] and herself.[24] She tries to explain to her son why she chose to disassemble the stable life he had during her marriage.[25] Adele acknowledges that she still has a lot of self-discovery to do and compares herself to a child: \"I was still a child / Didn't get the chance to / Feel the world around me.\"[22] According to *Slant Magazine*'s Alexa Camp, the lyric reflects her \"grappling with a form of arrested development\".[26] In the song's bridge, Adele asserts that the divorce was well-intentioned and in the hopes of a better future.[15] Neil McCormick of *The Daily Telegraph* described the song as \"effectively, a huge, abject, shame- and excuse-filled apology\".[19]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![Chris Stapleton in a hat and black shirt](image)Adele recorded a duet version of \"Easy on Me\" with Chris Stapleton (*pictured in 2019*).\nOn 1 October 2021, the number \"30\" was projected on several buildings and landmarks around the world.[27] Three days later, Adele updated her social media accounts for the first time in months.[28] On 5 October, Adele hinted at the song and its music video by posting a teaser on the accounts. The black-and-white clip played an instrumental track and depicted Adele putting a cassette into the tape deck of a truck.[29][30][31] On 9 October, Adele shared a 40-second preview of it via Instagram Live.[32] \"Easy on Me\" was released on 15 October and marked her first single in nearly five years.[27][33] Sony Music sent it for radio airplay in Italy the same day.[34]\n\n\nIn the United States, Columbia Records released \"Easy on Me\" to adult contemporary and triple A stations on 18 October, and contemporary hit radio the following day.[35][36][37] The song was issued as a CD single in Germany on 22 October.[38] Columbia released a cassette single on 5 November 2021.[39] Adele recorded a duet version of it with Chris Stapleton, which was sent to country radio by In2une Nashville on 19 November.[a][41] With 5.4\u00a0million audience impressions,[b] this version became Adele's first entry on the Country Airplay chart at number 25. *Billboard*'s Gary Trust wrote that it made \"unprecedented airplay chart history\".[43] In October 2021, Ocado noted a 26 percent increase in tissue sales in the United Kingdom and connected this to the release of \"Easy on Me\", along with the cool weather: \"We also suspect Adele's new song about heartbreak may have also had something to do with it.\"[44]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *The Daily Telegraph* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[19] |\n| *Evening Standard* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[45] |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[17] |\n| *i* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[46] |\n| *The Independent* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[25] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[15] |\n| *The Times* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[47] |\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics.[48][49] Some commented on the production. McCormick thought the song was a daring return for Adele and exemplified the sheer crux of \"what music is, and why it means so much to us\".[19] Fiona Sturges of *i* believed it is wholehearted, anthemic, and places emphasis on Adele's voice, but it has a \"slightly over-produced sheen\" which reduces its sadness.[46] Likewise, *The Times*' Will Hodgkinson thought \"Easy on Me\" was fine and seasoned but \"a sheen of thoroughly American professionalism\" prevented its emotional resonance.[47]\n\n\nCritics discussed \"Easy on Me\" in relation to Adele's catalogue. Some thought it was a typical Adele song.[c] The *Evening Standard*'s Jochan Embley believed it did not compare to the sadness of \"Someone Like You\" (2011) or the emotion of \"Hello\" but was equally ardent.[45] Alexandra Pollard of *The Independent* thought it did not have a catchy melody like \"Hello\" but was just as sad and pithy and more intricate.[25] Petridis stated that it would not \"stop the listener in their tracks\" like \"Someone Like You\" but was relatable and more memorable than some tracks on *25*.[17] *Billboard*'s Jason Lipshutz likened several elements of \"Easy on Me\" to prior Adele songs but thought it was distinguished by its different lyrical theme.[52]\n\n\nAdele's vocals were the subject of commentary. Embley believed they were some of her best: \"She's so elegantly controlled, so piercingly poignant\".[45] *NME*'s Nick Levine thought the song delivered to the high expectations due to her prowess in communicating unvarnished emotion through her vocals and lyricism. He added that Adele sounds undoubtedly and magnificently like herself but \"richer and more confident\".[15] Cat Zhang of *Pitchfork* praised her delivery and said it is distinctive at a time when under-singing is popular. She added that despite dealing with a new breakup, Adele provides the same contentment.[50] Writing for *Rolling Stone*, Rob Sheffield thought she sang with more panache and delicacy but did not eschew \"the primal firepower\" that famed her.[53] *PopMatters*'s Peter Piatkowski stated that with her usual pristine performance, she exudes the immense sorrow she experiences and molds her great and pliable voice.[54]\n\n\nSome discussed the lyrics. Chris Willman of *Variety* believed that the theme of asking for forgiveness strayed from Adele's previous releases, portraying her as \"the possible offendee, not the offended\".[55] Writing for *The Line of Best Fit*, David Cobbald thought it was \"the most 'hunny'\" song on *30*. He noted its metaphors about water and opined it conveys a maturity and headway from the time of *25*.[56] Piatkowski believed that the lyrics were foreseeably intense and portrayed \"genuine and elegiac\" pain.[54] Levine opined the lyrics will relate with \"anyone going through a quarter-life crisis, a mid-life crisis, or just a crisis of a hangover\" and were likely to make them cry easily.[15]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" has been included in rankings of Adele's discography. *Rolling Stone* named it her 10th-best song in 2021.[57] *Far Out*'s Tyler Golsen and Jamie Kahn included it at number 17 in 2022.[58] That same year, *American Songwriter*'s Tina Benitez-Eves declared \"Easy on Me\" Adele's best song.[59] It was included on critical lists of the best songs of 2021, by *Billboard* at number 14,[60] *The Forty-Five* and *NME* at number 26,[61][62] and *Consequence* at number 27.[63] The song also appeared in an unranked list by *Vogue*.[64]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received several awards and nominations. It won the Brit Award for Song of the Year at the 2022 ceremony.[65] That year, \"Easy on Me\" also received the *Gaffa* Award for Foreign Song of the Year,[66] the Juno Award for Video of the Year,[67] and the New Music Award for Top 40/CHR Song of the Year.[68] At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023, the song won Best Pop Solo Performance and was nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Music Video.[69] Other nominations include The Song of 2021 and The Music Video of 2021 at the 47th People's Choice Awards,[70] Favourite Pop Song and Favourite Music Video at the American Music Awards of 2022,[71] Song of the Year and Best Lyrics at the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards,[72] the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically,[73] and the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Year.[74]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nUpon release, \"Easy on Me\" achieved success on streaming platforms. It became the most streamed song on Spotify, both in a day[d] and a single week.[e][77] In the United Kingdom, \"Easy on Me\" opened with 3.2\u00a0million Spotify streams, the most received by any song in a day.[77] It also broke the record for the most streamed song in a single week in the country, with 24 million streams.[78] On Amazon Music, it earned the most first-day streams globally and the most first-day Alexa requests for any song in the platform's history.[79] \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 195 on the *Billboard* Global 200 with just five hours of tracking and became Adele's first song to reach the chart's summit the following week. That week, it sold 136,300 downloads, the third-largest sales week for any song on that chart, and earned 178.2\u00a0million streams, the second-largest streaming week. It also became the second number one song in history to double the chart points of the number two.[80]\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 68 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 with its first five hours of tracking.[81] The following week, it became Adele's fifth chart-topping single. It also debuted at number one on the Digital Song Sales and Streaming Songs charts, and number four on Radio Songs where it earned the highest debut ever.[82] \"Easy on Me\" recorded the most first-week plays among all songs in US radio history and became the first to be most-added on five radio formats in a single week.[83] *Billboard* named it one of the biggest number one singles \"of the last 30 years\".[84] The song reached number one on the *Billboard* Adult Contemporary airplay chart, becoming Adele's sixth leader on the list and had the quickest trajectory to number one for a non-holiday song since \"Hello\".[85] During its sixth week on the Hot 100, Adele earned simultaneous top-five placements with \"Easy on Me\" at number one and \"Oh My God\" debuting at number five.[86] \"Easy on Me\" stayed at number one for ten weeks, tying \"Hello\" as Adele's longest-running number one song on the Hot 100.[87] In its fourteenth week, \"Easy on Me\" became the first song to surpass 100\u00a0million in radio reach since the Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" (2019) one and a half year earlier.[88] The Recording Industry Association of America certified it 4\u00d7 Platinum in November\u00a02022.[89]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number one on the Official Singles Chart on the chart issued for 28 October 2021. With 217,300 units, it marked the highest first week sales for any song since 2017.[78] \"Easy on Me\" spent eight nonconsecutive weeks at number one, becoming her longest-running number one single in the UK.[90][91] The British Phonographic Industry certified it 3\u00d7 Platinum in June\u00a02023.[92] \"Easy on Me\" debuted atop Australia's ARIA Singles Chart, becoming her third song to reach the position.[93] It spent four weeks at the summit and received a 6\u00d7 Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association.[94][95] In Canada, \"Easy on Me\" spent eight weeks at number one on the Canadian Hot 100.[96] Music Canada certified it 3\u00d7 Platinum in January 2022.[97] Elsewhere, \"Easy on Me\" reached number one in Austria,[98] Belgium,[99] Costa Rica,[100] Croatia,[101] Czech Republic,[102] Denmark,[103] Germany,[104] Iceland,[105] Ireland,[106] Israel,[107] Italy,[108] Lithuania,[109] Malaysia,[110] the Netherlands,[111] New Zealand,[112] Norway,[113] Singapore,[114] Slovakia,[115] South Africa,[116] Sweden,[117] and Switzerland.[118] The song was certified 2\u00d7 Diamond in Brazil,[119] Diamond in France,[120] 3\u00d7 Platinum in Portugal and Switzerland,[121][122] 2\u00d7 Platinum in Denmark,[123] Italy,[124] Mexico,[125] New Zealand,[126] Poland,[127] and Sweden,[128] Platinum in Belgium,[129] Germany,[130] Spain,[119] and Greece,[131] and Gold in Austria.[132]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nXavier Dolan, who had previously directed the music video for \"Hello\", also directed the one for \"Easy on Me\". The latter was filmed in the same house as \"Hello\", at the Chemin Jordan and Domaine Dumont Chapelle Ste-Agn\u00e8s in Sutton, Quebec, on 15 and 16 September 2021.[133][134][135] The video starts black-and-white before changing to full colour midway. According to Camp, it \"picks up where 'Hello' left off\".[26] Adele gazes across the empty house and outside the window before packing up her belongings, putting on sunglasses, and moving out.[135][136] She talks with someone on a mobile phone[137][138] and inserts a cassette into the tape deck of a furniture truck, which plays \"Easy on Me\".[46][139] Adele mourns the end of her own marriage while driving away and spectating a separate couple's engagement celebration as several pages of sheet music fly out of the car's windows.[46][135][140]\n\n\nThe video was released on 15 October 2021 at midnight UK time to 200,000 viewers during the premiere. It reached 12 million views within 12 hours and 90 million within six days of release.[136][140] Several critics thought it referenced other Adele music videos, including \"Hello\", \"Rolling in the Deep\" (2010), and \"Chasing Pavements\" (2008).[140][138][137] *Parade*'s Rose Maura Lorre described it as a sequel to \"Hello\" and compared a chair in it to the one in the \"Rolling in the Deep\" music video.[138] Sophia McFarland of *The Spokesman-Review* believed it was \"a cinematic masterpiece in itself\".[140] BBC News' Mark Savage opined that the transition from black and white to colours represented \"the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first\".[141] A video of bloopers from the production of the music video was released on 4 November 2021.[139]\n\n\n\n## Live performances and cover versions[edit]\n\n\nAdele performed \"Easy on Me\" live for the first time during her CBS special *Adele One Night Only* (2021).[142] She reprised the song at the 23rd NRJ Music Awards on 20 November 2021.[143] Adele hit an incorrect note during her first attempt at singing it for her ITV special *An Audience with Adele* (2021) and restarted the performance: \"I'm shitting myself.\"[144] She performed \"Easy on Me\" during her British Summer Time concerts on 1 and 2 July 2022.[145] Adele included the song in the set list for Weekends with Adele, her 2022\u20132023 concert residency.[146][147] She wore a full-length black gown and sang afront a coral green backdrop. Reviewing the show on 18 November 2022, *The New York Times*' Lindsay Zoladz believed Adele seemed nervous and \"relied a bit too heavily on encouraging the crowd to sing her lyrics\", and *Harper's Bazaar*'s Bianca Betancourt thought she \"appeared visibly emotional\" before it.[148][149][150]\n\n\nSeveral artists recorded cover versions of \"Easy on Me\". Kanye West and the Sunday Service Choir performed a cover with changed lyrics, as a tribute to Virgil Abloh after he died on 28 November 2021.[151][152] Chloe Bailey uploaded a cover of the song on 9 December 2021, which included whistle tones and vocal runs; *Uproxx*'s Wongo Okon commented that she sang the challenging song without any problems.[153][154] On 4 January 2022, Travis Barker released a cover, on which he played the drums[155][156] and guitar[157] and transformed it into a rock ballad.[158] The Vitamin String Quartet, whose violin player Leah Zeger had accompanied Adele during the *One Night Only* performance, released a version of \"Easy on Me\" with string instruments on 4 March 2022.[159] Keith Urban introduced his acoustic guitar cover of the song during a March 2022 show: \"I would like to make a special dedication tonight, to somebody I just absolutely adore as a performer, as a songwriter, a trailblazer,\u00a0[...] We love you Adele, oh yes we do.\"[160][161] In July\u00a02023, 13-year-old musician Nandi Bushell shared her cover of it; she noted in the caption that it was her first video singing and playing piano simultaneously.[162][163][164] \"Easy on Me\" has also been covered by contestants on *The Voice*.[165][166][167]\n\n\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of *30*.[9]\n\n\n\n* Greg Kurstin \u2013

It was released on 19 November 2021 by Columbia Records. *30* was inspired by Adele's experiences and anxiety following her divorce and its impact on her son's life, along with motherhood and fame. Adele had begun working on the album in 2018 and collaborated with producers such as Greg Kurstin, Max Martin, Inflo, Tobias Jesso Jr., Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, Shawn Everett, and Shellback.\n\n\nMusically, *30* is a pop, soul, and jazz album, which incorporates dance-pop, gospel, and R&B elements. The album was promoted with the television specials *Adele One Night Only* and *An Audience with Adele*. Three singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"Easy on Me\", reached number one in several countries, including the US and UK. The follow-up singles, \"Oh My God\" and \"I Drink Wine\", charted in the UK chart's top five simultaneously with it.\n\n\n*30* received acclaim from music critics, who emphasized Adele's vocal performance as well as the lyricism and subject matter. Media outlets included it in their lists of the best albums of 2021. The album was nominated for two Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, and it won the Brit Award for British Album of the Year at the Brit Awards 2022, making Adele the first solo artist in history to win the award three times.\n\n\n*30* reached number one in several countries. In the UK, it achieved the highest first-week sales for any album by a female artist since Adele's third studio album, *25* (2015). It spent five weeks at number one there and six in the US. *30* was the best-selling album of the year in both countries, as well as worldwide, with 5.54 million copies sold.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nDuring the conception of her third studio album, *25* (2015), Adele wrote enough material for what she believed could be three or four albums. She later revealed that she had four or five songs that she might revisit at a later date, among them a Greg Kurstin-produced song that she felt was more appropriate once she was older.[1] In 2018, mainstream media outlets reported that Adele was working on her fourth studio album.[2] Drummer Matt Chamberlain confirmed that he had been in the studio with her for her fourth studio album, along with Rick Nowels, John Legend and Raphael Saadiq, in hopes of crafting an album \"full of soul, with a more eclectic sound.\"[3][4]\n\n\nFollowing Adele's marriage to Simon Konecki in 2018,[5] she filed for divorce in 2019.[6] On a journey of self-healing, she began taking therapy sessions and mended her estranged relationship with her father.[6] Adele experienced anxiety which, along with her separation from Konecki and the scrutiny of fame and motherhood, inspired *30*.[6] The years that followed plagued Adele, especially due to the effect it had on her son. Adele decided to have regular conversations with her son about the divorce and recorded her conversations following advice from her therapist.[7][6] Around the same time, Adele returned to the studio inspired by her conversations with her son and wanting to create a body of work that would explain to him why she left his father.[6]\n\n\nEarly on in the promotion for *25*, Adele revealed that she planned to stop naming albums after her age.[8][9] However, on her 31st birthday, Adele published a rare social media post in which she\u00a0\u2013 seemingly jokingly\u00a0\u2013 referred to her next album as *30*, alluding to the theme of her previous three albums' titles.[6] On 15 February 2020, Adele announced at a friend's wedding that her fourth studio album would be out by September 2020.[10] However, she would later confirm that the album's production and release had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[11]\n\n\nOn 18 October 2020, Adele confirmed she would be hosting the 24 October episode of *Saturday Night Live*, reinvigorating fans' hope that new music would be imminent.[12] However, during the episode, Adele confirmed that her fourth studio album was not yet finished.[13] She later hinted via an Instagram post that she would be returning to music in 2021.[14] Comedian Alan Carr, a close friend of Adele's, also hinted that the album would be released in 2021, describing the material he had heard from the album as \"amazing\" during an interview with *Grazia*'s UK edition.[15]\n\n\n\n## Writing and recording[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPrevious collaborators Greg Kurstin, Max Martin, and Shellback (*pictured* left to right), also served as producers on *30*.\n\nUsing music as an outlet post-divorce, Adele went to the studio describing it as \"basically running away\".[16] Similarly to Adele's previous albums, the vocal tracks used on *30* are original demos.[17]\nAdele wanted to create a \"safe space\" during the album's recording and opted to work with fewer people than on her previous project *25*.[18] \nChoosing producers Adele felt comfortable with influenced her choice in collaborators. Adele reunited with Kurstin, a long-time collaborator and friend, which allowed her to feel as though she \"could say anything, sing anything, and they wouldn't judge me.\"[19] Together Adele and Kurstin worked on six songs; \"Easy on Me\", \"My Little Love\", \"Cry Your Heart Out\", \"Oh My God\", \"I Drink Wine\" and \"All Night Parking\".\n\n\nOriginally a 15-minute song, inspired by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, \"I Drink Wine\" was written by Adele to express her remorse for not being present for a close friend and was later cut short following label feedback.[20] \"All Night Parking\" posthumously credits American jazz pianist Erroll Garner as a featured artist, making it the first song on a standard Adele album to have a featured artist credit. Adele worked with previous collaborators and Swedish producers and songwriters Max Martin and Shellback, and Canadian singer-songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr. \"Oh My God\", produced by Kurstin, was written during a period of time when Adele's anxiety was subsiding.[21] Referencing dating post-divorce, Adele wrote the song inspired by her first time flirting after her split with Simon Konecki.[21]\n\n\nAdele also worked with producers for the first time, including Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, and British producer Inflo (of the music collective Sault).[6][22] Heavily inspired by the Judy Garland biopic,[23] Adele was attracted to the new sounds, chords and cadences G\u00f6ransson introduced to her which led to the song \"Strangers by Nature\".[19] Adele immediately gravitated towards Inflo, due to their similar age and both being raised in North London. The pair's recording sessions would often start with extensive conversations, before pin-pointing an emotion they wanted to write about.[18] Together they wrote and produced three songs, \"Woman like Me\", \"Hold On\" and \"Love Is a Game\". The latter was inspired by *Breakfast at Tiffany's*, which was played on mute during the recording sessions.[6] \"Hold On\" was written by Adele regarding the numerous times she lost hope during her divorce and features backing vocals from her friends. Recalling writing the track Adele said; \"I remember I didn't belly laugh for about a year. But I didn't realize I was making progress until I wrote 'Hold On' and listened to it back. Later, I was like, 'Oh, fuck, I've really learned a lot. I've really come a long way.'\"[23] By February 2020, *30* was mostly completed, except for some orchestral elements and backing vocals.[16]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n> \n> I just felt like I wanted to explain to him, through this record, when he's in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness. It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Adele on her son and *30*, *Vogue*[6]\n\n*Stereogum* described *30* as a pop, soul, and jazz record.[24] It also contains elements of R&B,[25] gospel,[26] and dance-pop.[27] The album incorporates choir vocals, harmonies, voice notes, violins, strings, organs, and horns.[28] Thematically, the album addresses Adele's divorce, anxiety, and motherhood. During an Instagram Live on 9 October 2021, Adele reiterated that *30* would centre on her divorce.[29] Adele noted that *30* is more introspective than her previous efforts. \"I feel like this album is self-destruction, then self-reflection and then sort of self-redemption\", she said. \"I really want people to hear my side of the story this time.\"[29][30]\n\n\nThe album opens with \"Strangers by Nature\", a cinematic song featuring organs, strings and mournful lyrics. The song closes with the line \"All right then, I'm ready\", before leading into \"Easy on Me\".[31] The latter is a piano torch ballad,[32] on which Adele addresses her divorce and pleads for forgiveness and understanding from her son,[33][34] ex-husband,[35][36] and herself.[37] \"My Little Love\" is a jazz,[38][39] R&B,[38][40] and soul song,[41] which incorporates voice notes of Adele's conversations with her son as she explains the effects of her divorce on his life and apologizes.[42] The album's fourth track, \"Cry Your Heart Out\" is an uptempo piano-driven song, contrasting with its lyrics about depression and anxiety, but also the feeling of relief.[43] The production of \"Oh My God\" incorporates claps, keys, the organ, and bass along with an R&B groove and dance-pop\u2013electropop sample.[44] It lyrically details Adele's first time being flirted with after her divorce.[45] \"Can I Get It\" is an upbeat acoustic guitar-driven track with a whistled chorus. Lyrically, the song is about love and desiring a true and lasting relationship.[24] \"I Drink Wine\" is a gospel-oriented power ballad, addressing Adele's divorce and shedding her ego before regaining the ability to love again.[46]\n\n\n\"All Night Parking\" is an interlude that features Garner. The song is built around a sample of Joey Pecoraro's \"Finding Parking\" (2017), which in turn samples Garner's \"No More Shadows\" (1964). The song is about falling in love in a long-distance relationship and the excitement that comes with it.[47] \"Woman Like Me\", the album's ninth track, has an acoustic instrumental. The song is about a partner who is not willing to move on from his previous relationship and lets it cloud his current one. Adele calls him out for his laziness and self-doubt.[48] \"Hold On\" is a gospel-tinged song, with Adele backed by a choir. The song describes her feelings about her divorce and telling herself to stay hopeful for the future.[49] \"To Be Loved\" is also a piano ballad, on which Adele explains her divorce to her son and hopes to find a path to true happiness.[50] The album's closer, \"Love Is a Game\", is a cinematic jazz influenced song that lyrically details finding love again and navigating a romantic relationship.[51]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\nOn the weekend of 1 October, a series of advertising hoardings and projections displaying the number \"30\" appeared in various locations across the globe, with reports that it could be tied to Adele's forthcoming studio album, *30*.[52] On Monday, 4 October, Adele's social media accounts and website were updated to match the blue colour from the advertisements.[53] The next day, Adele officially announced a 15 October release for the album's lead single, \"Easy On Me\", with a clip of its music video on her social media accounts.[54] Later that week, Adele became the first person to simultaneously appear on the covers of both British and American *Vogue* publications in the same month.[55] On 13 October 2021, Adele officially announced the album title as *30* and 19 November 2021 as the release date.[56] The track-listing of *30* was revealed on 1 November 2021. A preview of \"Hold On\" was featured in an Amazon television commercial entitled *Kindness, the Greatest Gift*, portraying anxiety among young adults associated with the pandemic and premiered on 8 November 2021.[57]\n\n\nOn 4 November, *Consequence* reported that the production of vinyls for *30* had contributed to \"a major delay\" in the vinyl industry. More than 500,000 vinyl LPs of *30* were manufactured in the months leading up to the release, as Sony Music removed other albums from its overseas pressing plants, which was a factor along with the pandemic.[17][58] Adele received criticism for this, however, subsequent reports stated it \"probably wasn't [Adele's] fault\".[59][60] Unlike *25*, *30* was made available on streaming services the same day as its release on physical formats.[17] Columbia Records, which previously only handled Adele's releases in North America, promoted the album worldwide.[61] The Target-exclusive deluxe edition adds two bonus tracks and a duet version of \"Easy on Me\" with American singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton.[62][63] The vinyl variants were sold through digital retailers while cassette tapes were available on Adele's webstore.[64][65]\n\n\n*30* was promoted with television specials. The CBS special *Adele One Night Only*, which featured Adele's interview with Oprah Winfrey along with performances of previously released material and *30* tracks, aired on CBS on 14 November 2021.[66][67] It drew 11.7 million viewers.[68] The ITV1 special *An Audience with Adele*, which was filmed at the London Palladium, aired on 21 November.[69] Adele also announced a Las Vegas concert residency, *Weekends with Adele*, which was initially scheduled to begin on 21 January 2022 and run for 24 concerts.[70] Adele delayed it, citing production delays and COVID-19.[71] It was eventually rescheduled to begin on 18 November 2022, and after a pair of extensions is now scheduled to end in June 2024.[72][73] Adele also performed two concerts at British Summer Time Hyde Park, London, on 1 and 2 July 2022.[74]\n\n\n*30* was promoted with three singles. \"Easy on Me\" was released on 15 October 2021.[75] Upon release, it became the most streamed song, both in a day and a single week on Spotify.[76] The song topped the charts in various countries, including the UK Singles Chart and the US *Billboard* Hot 100.[77][78] Its duet version with Stapleton was promoted to US country radio stations on 19 November 2021.[79] \"Oh My God\" was released as the second single on 29 November 2021.[80] It debuted at number two on the Official Singles Chart, behind \"Easy on Me\", and number five on the US *Billboard* Hot 100.[81][82] The Sam Brown-directed music video for the song was uploaded on Adele's YouTube channel on 12 January 2022.[83] \"I Drink Wine\" was sent for radio airplay in Italy on 4 November 2022, as the album's third single.[84] Its release was accompanied by a music video directed by Joe Talbot.[85]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Aggregate scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 7.9/10[86] |\n| Metacritic | 88/100[87] |\n| Review scores |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[33] |\n| *And It Don't Stop* | A\u2013[88] |\n| *The Daily Telegraph* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[89] |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | A\u2212[40] |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[90] |\n| *The Independent* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[91] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[39] |\n| *Pitchfork* | 8.2/10[37] |\n| *Rolling Stone* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[92] |\n| *The Times* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[93] |\n\n\n*30* received acclaim from music critics,[94] many of whom dubbed it as Adele's best album yet.[95][96] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised score out of 100 to ratings from publications, the album received a weighted mean score of 88 based on 23 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[87] It is Adele's highest-rated album on the site.[97]\n\n\nVeteran critic Robert Christgau described *30* as a \"breakthrough\" for Adele and believed she \"explores new vistas of virtuosity, subtly because subtlety is her thing ... texturing and shading her mezzo on an album a step up variety-wise from its predecessors\".[88] *Rolling Stone*'s Rob Sheffield called it her \"toughest, most powerful album yet\" with the best vocal performance of her career and praised its \"deft\" production.[92] Neil McCormick of *The Daily Telegraph* believed *30* was her strongest record yet, with its \"powerhouse\" songs, \"intense\" emotions and \"bravura\" performances.[89] Emma Swann of *DIY* described the album as \"raw and uncompromising\", matching cinematic music with lyrics on \"the pain, the self-flagellation, the hope, the acceptance.\"[98]\n\n\nMikael Wood of *Los Angeles Times* highlighted her \"soaring yet pulpy, gorgeous\" vocals.[41] *The Independent* critic Annabel Nugent found the subject matter candid, unfiltered and \"unmediated\" and believed it contained some optimistic love songs, unlike her previous records whose sad themes \"can be wearisome in excess.\"[91] Kate Solomon, writing for *i*, said that *30* was a \"reverent and messy, polished and painful\" album from a \"woman in turmoil, from raging wine-fuelled nights to quiet teary moments\".[99]\n\n\nDavid Cobbald of *The Line of Best Fit* complimented the theatrical essence of *30* and the use of electronic instruments and synthesisers in its production, but was less impressed by some of its upbeat songs.[100] *Pitchfork* critic Jillian Mapes called *30* an \"incredibly moving album\" and Adele's most ambitious work to-date due to its \"nuanced\" production.[37] *NME*'s El Hunt and *The Guardian*'s Alexis Petridis gave mixed reviews. Hunt said *30* was Adele's most creative album but stuck to \"safer territory\"; he appreciated the incorporation of new sounds but felt the compositions of \"Hold On\", \"I Drink Wine\", and \"Can I Get It\" were jarring.[39] Petridis said the album is monotonous musically and lyrically compared to her previous albums, and \"given their sales figures, you couldn't blame Adele for declining to even tinker with a formula that clearly ain't broke. But she does, and it makes for *30*'s highlights.\"[101]\n\n\n*The A.V. Club* noted Adele's homage to Amy Winehouse and her influence on *30*: \"*30* is arguably Adele's most soul-baring album [...] As Winehouse did on *Back To Black*, here Adele also navigates the grief that comes with breaking the ties of love, washing herself in heartache. In its own way, *30* feels like a thank-you to Winehouse and the mark she made on music.\"[102] *Mic* called the album \"a record for the millennials\" who \"bare the emotional scars of time just as she does\".[103] *The Ringer* compared the difference between Adele and other pop stars, saying that \"Unlike many of her peers, Adele is not obliged to keep a master narrative going to sustain general interest in her career. She just\u2026 sings.\"[104]\n\n\n\n### Year-end lists[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSelect year-end rankings of *30*\n| Publication\n | List\n | Rank\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BBC | The 21 Best Albums of 2021\n | 10\n | [105] |\n| *Billboard* | The 50 Best Albums of 2021: Staff List\n | 4\n | [106] |\n| *Consequence* | Top 50 Albums of 2021\n | 20\n | [107] |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | The 10 best albums of 2021\n | 5\n | [108] |\n| *Los Angeles Times* | The 10 best albums of 2021\n | 7\n | [109] |\n| *The New York Times* | Lindsay Zoladz's Best Albums of 2021\n | 1\n | [110] |\n| NPR Music | The 50 Best Albums of 2021\n | 14\n | [111] |\n| *Pitchfork* | The 50 Best Albums of 2021\n | 32\n | [112] |\n| *Rolling Stone* | 50 Best Albums of 2021\n | 2\n | [113] |\n| *Variety* | Chris Willman's Top 10 Albums of 2021\n | 5\n | [114] |\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAdele received four nominations at the Brit Awards 2022, winning three: British Album of the Year for *30*, Song of the Year for \"Easy on Me\", and Artist of the Year.[115] Adele also received four nominations at the iHeartRadio Music Awards,[116] winning two for *30* with Best Comeback Album and Pop Album of the Year.[117] \"Easy on Me\" won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 65th ceremony, furthering Adele's streak for the most wins in the category, with four.[118]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Ceremony\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | American Music Awards | Favorite Pop Album | Nominated\n | [119] |\n| ARIA Music Awards | Best International Artist | Nominated\n | [120] |\n| *Billboard* Music Awards | Top *Billboard* 200 Album | Nominated\n | [121] |\n| Brit Awards | British Album of the Year | Won\n | [122] |\n| Danish Music Awards | International Album of the Year\n | Won\n | [123] |\n| *Gaffa* Awards | Foreign Album of the Year\n | Won\n | [124] |\n| iHeartRadio Music Awards | Best Comeback Album\n | Won\n | [125] |\n| Pop Album of the Year\n | Won\n |\n| Juno Awards | International Album of the Year | Nominated\n | [126] |\n| Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Album\n | Nominated\n | [127] |\n| LOS40 Music Awards | Best International Album | Nominated\n | [128] |\n| MTV Video Music Awards | Album of the Year | Nominated\n | [129] |\n| 2023\n | Grammy Awards | Album of the Year | Nominated\n | [130] |\n| Best Pop Vocal Album | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2021, three weeks before its release, *30* became the most pre-added album ever on Apple Music, surpassing Billie Eilish's *Happier Than Ever* (2021); it also achieved the largest number of pre-adds in a single day, and did so in the shortest timeframe.[131] *Billboard* noted that in the ten weeks leading up to *30*'s release, Adele's three previous albums were averaging 41,000 units a week combined; this marked a 173% increase in their performance that year prior to then when her catalog averaged about 15,000 units a week.[132] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry reported that Adele was the world's second best-selling female artist of 2021, behind Taylor Swift.[133] *30* was the best-selling album of 2021 worldwide, topping the Global Album All-Format Chart, Global Album Sales Chart, and the newly created Global Vinyl Album Chart; the album sold 862,000 vinyl copies within the year.[134][135] In July 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that *30* \"largely came and went\", compared with Adele's previous albums.[136]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 November 2021, the Official Charts Company reported that *30* logged 167,000 chart sales in the UK in the first half of its opening week, more than the rest of the chart's top 40 combined.[137] Five days after release, the album achieved the biggest opening week of 2021 in the country.

The song also topped the charts in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland and peaked at number four on the *Billboard* Hot 100.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSheeran referred to the song while explaining why the album title was *=* instead of *\u2013*, as fans had predicted, in which he said: \"I was making the record and I wrote a song called 'Shivers' and I was like, 'This doesn't really feel like [*Minus*]\".[2] Sheeran wrote \"Shivers\" at the end of the Divide tour, when he set up a studio at a rented farm in Suffolk where he had his last date of the tour. It took him three days to write the song, which was unusually long for him, as he felt the song \"was too special to get wrong\".[3]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 August 2021, Sheeran announced his fourth studio album, *=*, in which the song is listed on the tracklist.[4] He later announced the cover art and release date of the song on 2 September 2021. He also revealed that \"Shivers\" was originally intended to be the lead single for the album instead of its current lead single, \"Bad Habits\".[3] A preview of the song was also listed.[5] Sheeran announced its accompanying music video and a teaser video of it on Labour Day, 6 September 2021.[6]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nOn 2 September 2021, the same day Sheeran announced the song, Jonathan Heaf from the United Kingdom branch of *GQ* in Sheeran's hometown, described the song as \"a sexy, rocketing song that includes hand claps in the bridge and is music to dance to with your best friends after three too many tequilas\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Music video and lyric video[edit]\n\n\n### Music video[edit]\n\n\nA music video was released along with the song on 10 September 2021, starring Sheeran and AnnaSophia Robb. It has over 300 million views as of August 2023. Like his previous video, \"Bad Habits\", it was directed by Dave Meyers. In the music video, Sheeran meets Robb at a diner and starts going through wild fantasies with her, including getting revived in a morgue after a text from her that he was waiting for finally arrives, dancing together in a bird-filled hotel, and fighting off some goons (with Sheeran suddenly wearing knight armor in the midst of the fight). In some scenes in the music video, Sheeran wears sequins and feathers.[8]\n\n\n\n### Lyric video[edit]\n\n\nThe lyric video for \"Shivers\" was released on 13 September 2021.[9]\n\n\n\n## Track
