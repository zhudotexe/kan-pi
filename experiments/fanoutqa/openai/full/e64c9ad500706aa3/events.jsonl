You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis page provides **lists of best-selling books and book series** to date and in any language. *\"Best-selling\"* refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records* as of 1995, the Bible is the best selling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed.[1] Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least 800 million copies for the Qur'an and 190 million copies for the Book of Mormon.[2] Also, a single publisher has produced more than 140 million copies of the Bhagavad Gita. The total number could be much higher.[3] Among non-religious texts, the *Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung*, also known as the *Little Red Book*, has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures—with estimates ranging from 800 million[1] to over 6.5 billion printed volumes.[4] Some claim the distribution ran into the \"billions\"[5] and some cite \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations\".[6][7] Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the lists of best-selling books below for these reasons.\n\n\nMany books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, *The Lord of the Rings* as one text was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009, but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million.[8] As such accurate figures are only available from the 1990s and in western nations such as US, UK and Australia. Further, e-books have not been included as out of copyright texts are often available freely in this format. Examples of books with reported high sales include *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas,[9] *Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes,[10] *Journey to the West* by Wu Cheng'en[11] and *The Lord of the Rings*[12] (which has been sold as both a three volume series, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*, and as a single combined volume) by J. R. R. Tolkien. Hence, in cases where there is too much uncertainty, they are excluded from the list.\n\n\nHaving sold more than 600 million copies worldwide*,[13] Harry Potter* by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, has sold in excess of 120 million copies,[14] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 85 languages,[15] placing *Harry Potter* among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, and the final installment, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.[16][17] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n  Nonfiction\n\n\n\n## List of best-selling individual books[edit]\n\n\n### More than 100 million copies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Book | Author(s) | Original language | First published | Approximate sales\n | Genre\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *A Tale of Two Cities* | Charles Dickens | English | 1859 | >200 million[20][*circular reporting?*] | Historical fiction |\n| *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) | Antoine de Saint-Exupéry | French | 1943 | 200 million[21][22] | Fantasy, Children's fiction |\n| *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* | J.
