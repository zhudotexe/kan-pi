He played college basketball for the Washington Huskies before being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\n\nDuring his single season (2016\u201317) with the Huskies, Fultz played point guard and shooting guard. Despite Washington's relatively disappointing year, he was named a third-team All-American and first-team All-Pac-12. He began his NBA career with the 76ers before being traded to the Magic in 2019.\n\n\nUnable to recreate his offensive prowess he had in college to the NBA, due to a shoulder injury called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), he is considered by many to be a draft bust.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fultz at the 2016 McDonald's All-American Game\nFultz was born on May 29, 1998, in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, the younger of two children. His father abandoned the family, so he relied heavily on his mother, Ebony.[3] Impassioned by basketball, Fultz was mentored in his early years by a local instructor named Keith Williams. In 2012, he began attending DeMatha Catholic High, an all-boys prep school and basketball powerhouse. He had shown promise on the DeMatha Stags' freshman team; but as a sophomore, the 5-foot-9-inch (1.75\u00a0m) guard was cut from the varsity roster.[4] He was overlooked due to his awkward gait, having the appearance of \"Bambi\"; as assistant coach Cory McCrae explained, \"He was long and lanky, and he\u2019d walk and his knees would be hurting\". However, Fultz outplayed the competition at the junior varsity level, making it apparent that he did not belong there.[4]\n\n\nAssistant coach Raphael Chillious of the Washington Huskies was the first to notice Fultz's potential, describing him as an athlete with the makings of an NBA All-Star-caliber player if he continued to grow. At the start of his junior season, Fultz stood 6\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.91\u00a0m).[5] As a starter for DeMatha's varsity team, he averaged 16.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game and was named the Player of the Year in the highly-competitive Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.[6] Among the highlights of his junior campaign were the game-winning foul shots he made in a 16-point performance while being guarded by Jayson Tatum of Chaminade and the triple-double he posted in a matchup against Roselle Catholic at the Hoophall Classic.[7] His recruiting stature abruptly soared during this season, with Rivals.com ranking him number 24 in the Class of 2016 and over 20 college programs offering him scholarships.[6]\n\n\nOn August 21, 2015, Fultz committed to the University of Washington.[8] As a senior, he averaged 19.1 points and 8.8 rebounds per game where he concluded his high school career as he recorded the Stags' single-season record for assists with 278 and led the team to their second consecutive conference championship.[6] At the McDonald's All-American Game on March 31, 2016, Fultz tallied 10 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists.[9] At the Jordan Brand Classic come April, Fultz accumulated 19 points in a 131\u2013117 East team victory.[10] During the summer, he was selected to Team USA's FIBA Americas Under-18 roster. With Fultz as its leading scorer, the team progressed to the gold medal championship game; and in dominant fashion, Fultz posted 23 points and earned the tournament's MVP award for his performance.[11]\n\n\nBy the end of his senior year, Fultz was rated as a five-star recruit considered a top-ten recruit in the 2016 class.[12][13] He was ranked as the third best point guard in the 2016 high school class and number three overall by Scout.com, number five by Rivals.com, and number seven by ESPN.[14][15][16] At DeMatha, Fultz was a basketball teammate and friend of Chase Young, who was later named the 2020 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year after being selected by the Washington Football Team second overall in the 2020 NFL Draft.[17]\n\n\n\n### College prospect info[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes\n| Name\n | Hometown\n | High school / college\n | Height\n | Weight\n | Commit date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Markelle Fultz** *PG* | Upper Marlboro, Maryland | DeMatha Catholic High School | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 190\u00a0lb (86\u00a0kg)\n | Aug 21, 2015\u00a0\n |\n| **Recruiting star ratings:** Scout:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rivals:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0247Sports:![5/5 stars](image) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ESPN:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ESPN grade:\u00a096\n |\n| **Overall recruiting rankings:** Scout: *3* \u00a0\u00a0Rivals: *5*\u00a0\u00a0ESPN: *7* |\n| * \n* *Note*: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height\u00a0and weight.\n* In these cases, the average was taken.

We would have gone to the (NCAA) tournament and won\".[18] Without any proven talent and only one returning starter, Fultz took charge as a team leader and primary scorer.[18] As the starting point guard, he debuted in a 98\u201390 home game loss to the Yale Bulldogs in which he posted 30 points.[19]\n\n\nAlthough the Huskies finished with a disappointing 9\u201322 record, Fultz enjoyed one of the best freshman seasons in all Pac-12 Conference history.[18] In 25 games that season, his 23.2 point average was the highest mark in the Pac-12 in 20 years and second in Huskies history behind Bob Houbregs' 25.6 points per game in 1952\u20131953.[18] Fultz also led the team in minutes played with 35.7 per game as well as assists with 5.7 per game and was second in rebounds with 5.9 per game. By the time Pac-12 honors were awarded, Fultz\u2014\u200cthe lone Husky selected\u2014\u200cwas named to the First-team All-Pac-12 and Third-team All-American.[20] A player who \"jumps off the page athletically and possesses creative scoring instincts and playmaking skills\", the consensus among sports analysts was that Fultz would be the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.[21]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (2017\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\nFultz was selected as the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, who then finalized his four-year rookie contract on July 8.[22] The 76ers, after years of mediocrity, had lofty expectations of returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2012; such were the high hopes that rested on their new core consisting of Fultz, Joel Embiid, and Ben Simmons.[23] In his first regular season game, on October 18, the rookie posted 10 points, 3 rebounds, and 1 assist in 18 minutes of play coming off the bench.[24] It was not long, however, before a shoulder injury\u2014termed a \"scapular muscle imbalance\"\u2014so ravaged his shooting that he shot only 33 percent from the field and attempted zero three-pointers in four games. In response, the 76ers decided to sit Fultz indefinitely until he recovered.[25][26] Debate ensued between sports analysts and the organization over how much his shooting woes were of physical versus psychological origin.[27] Fultz himself later clarified: \"What happened [...] was an injury. Let me get that straight. It was an injury that happened that didn\u2019t allow me to go through the certain paths that I needed to, to shoot the ball.\"[28]\n\n\nDuring his hiatus, Fultz's basic shooting mechanics appeared to change under a trainer from outside the 76ers organization; this and his lengthy recovery period taken were heavily scrutinized.[29] The team's president of basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo, suggested that the rookie might very well sit for the remainder of the season; but on March 26, 2018, it was announced that Fultz would return to the hardwood for an upcoming game against the Denver Nuggets.[30] Despite some missteps, such as one air ball shot and some shots blocked, Fultz put up 10 points and 8 assists in 14 minutes of playing time.[31] On April 11, at the age of 19 and 317 days, Fultz became the youngest player in NBA history at the time to record a triple-double, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 130\u201395 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, a record that was later broken by LaMelo Ball.[32][33]\n\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, head coach Brett Brown named Fultz the starting shooting guard over veteran JJ Redick.[34] Fifteen games into the season, however, Fultz lost the position to Jimmy Butler, whom the 76ers acquired in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Conflicting statements regarding Fultz's health and poor production continued to be sources of conflict and drama for the team. On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which \u201caffects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle\u2019s ability to shoot a basketball\u201d.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (2019\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 7, 2019, Fultz was traded to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Jonathon Simmons, an Oklahoma City Thunder first-round pick, and a Cleveland Cavaliers second round pick.[37] Magic coach Steve Clifford later stated in March that he did not anticipate Fultz returning to play during the season, stressing that his shoulder injury was indeed \"very serious.\"[38] Fultz made his Magic debut on October 23, 2019, putting up 12 points, six assists, and two steals in a 94\u201385 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.[39]\n\n\nOn December 27, 2020, Fultz put up 26 points in a 120\u2013113 win over the Washington Wizards.[40] On January 6, 2021, Fultz suffered a torn ACL against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first quarter and missed the remainder of the 2020\u201321 season.[41][42]\n\n\nFultz resumed playing on February 28, 2022, against the Indiana Pacers.[43] On April 10, Fultz put up a career-high 15 assists in a 125\u2013111 win over the Miami Heat.[44]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Fultz recorded a career-high 28 points and recorded four steals during a 113\u2013108 win over the Los Angeles Clippers .[45]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\u201318 | Philadelphia | 14 | 0 | 18.1 | .405 | .000 | .476 | 3.1 | 3.8 | .9 | .3 | 7.1\n |\n| 2018\u201319 | Philadelphia | 19 | 15 | 22.5 | .419 | .286 | .568 | 3.7 | 3.1 | .9 | .3 | 8.2\n |\n| 2019\u201320 | Orlando | **72** | **60** | 27.7 | .465 | .267 | .730 | 3.3 | 5.1 | 1.3 | .2 | 12.1\n |\n| 2020\u201321 | Orlando | 8 | 8 | 26.9 | .394 | .250 | **.895** | 3.1 | 5.4 | 1.0 | .3 | 12.9\n |\n| 2021\u201322 | Orlando | 18 | 3 | 20.0 | .474 | .235 | .806 | 2.7 | 5.5 | 1.1 | .3 | 10.8\n |\n| 2022\u201323 | Orlando | 60 | **60** | **29.6** | **.514** | **.310** | .783 | **3.9** | **5.7** | **1.5** | **.4** | **14.0** |\n| Career\n | 191 | 146 | 26.3 | .472 | .278 | .734 | 3.5 | 5.0 | 1.2 | .3 | 11.8\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | Philadelphia | 3 | 0 | 7.7 | .143 | \u2013 | .750 | 1.0 | 1.7 | .7 | .0 | 1.7\n |\n| 2020 | Orlando | **5** | **5** | **29.4** | **.400** | **.375** | **.857** | **2.2** | **5.2** | **1.0** | **.6** | **12.0** |\n| Career\n | 8 | 5 | 21.3 | .373 | .375 | .818 | 1.8 | 3.9 | .9 | .4 | 8.1\n |\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\u201317 | Washington | 25 | 25 | 35.7 | .476 | .413 | .649 | 5.7 | 5.9 | 1.6 | 1.2 | 23.2\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Magic Guard Markelle Fultz: Top 5 NBA Draft Bust?\".

A point guard, he played college basketball for one season with the UCLA Bruins, earning consensus first-team All-American honors before the Los Angeles Lakers selected him with the second overall pick of the 2017 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 2018.\n\n\nAs a high school senior at Chino Hills High School in 2016, Ball was awarded multiple national high school player of the year honors, and led his team, alongside his brothers LiAngelo and LaMelo, who are both current professional basketball players, to an undefeated 35-0 record, as well the consensus national top ranking. As a college freshman in 2016\u201317, he led the nation in assists and broke the UCLA record for the most assists in a season. Ball also won the Wayman Tisdale Award as the top freshman in the nation. As an NBA rookie with the Lakers, his playing time was limited by shoulder and knee injuries, and he was sidelined for much of his second season after an ankle injury. He was traded at the end of the season to the New Orleans Pelicans in a trade package for Anthony Davis. He played two seasons with the Pelicans before joining the Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal, but a persistent knee injury has sidelined him for the majority of his tenure with the team, with him missing the entirety of the 2022\u201323 season.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBall was born in Anaheim, California,[1] to LaVar and Tina Ball, who were both former college basketball players.[2] The 6-foot-6-inch (1.98\u00a0m) Ball started playing basketball at the age of two.[1] He idolized LeBron James, who he began following around age six and when James was a first-year NBA player with Cleveland.[3] Ball grew up with his younger brothers, LiAngelo and LaMelo. Until they reached high school, the trio played together on teams coached by their father.[4] Ball played basketball at Chino Hills High School in Chino Hills, California.[2] As a junior in 2014\u201315, he averaged 25 points, 11 rebounds, 9.1 assists, 5 blocks, and 5 steals.[5] In his senior year, he led the school to a 35\u20130 record and a state title, and the Huskies were ranked the consensus No. 1 team in the nation.[6][7] His younger brothers, junior LiAngelo and freshman LaMelo, were also on the team, as well as his cousin Andre.[8][9] Ball averaged a triple-double with averages of 23.9 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 11.7 assists per game.[2] He received national honors, including the Naismith Prep Player of the Year,[10][11] Morgan Wootten National Player of the Year,[12] *USA Today* Boys Basketball Player of the Year,[13] and Mr. Basketball USA.[14]\n\n\nBy the end of his senior year, Ball was rated as a consensus five-star recruit in the 2016 high school class.[15][16][17] He was ranked No. 4 overall recruit in the 2016 class behind Harry Giles, Josh Jackson and Jayson Tatum by both Rivals.com and ESPN, while Scout.com ranked him at No. 7.[18][19] In November 2015, he signed a National Letter of Intent to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and play for the Bruins.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ball playing in the 2016 McDonald's All-American Game.\nAs a freshman in 2016\u201317, he was one of 50 players named to the preseason watch list for the John R. Wooden Award, given annually to the top college player in the nation.[22] Ball's vision and passing skills led UCLA's rise up the national rankings,[23] as he and fellow freshman T. J. Leaf helped the Bruins bounce back from a 15\u201317 record from the year before to a 31\u20135 record.[24][25] Ball led the nation in assists and transformed the Bruins into the top scoring offense in the country.[26] In his first collegiate game against Pacific, he had 19 points, 11 assists, and eight rebounds.\n\n\nLater in the year, Ball was named the MVP of the Wooden Legacy tournament, after he led UCLA to a win over Texas A&M in the championship game.[27] He remained on the Wooden Award list in midseason, when he was also joined by Leaf, as UCLA was one of just five schools with two candidates on the list.[28]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2017, in a 107\u201366 blowout win against the Washington Huskies, Ball had 22 points, six rebounds, and five assists.[29] With close to two dozen NBA executives in attendance, the game matched Ball against the Huskies' Markelle Fultz, who were among the nation's top point guards and projected to be among the top picks in the 2017 NBA draft.[29][30] Fultz scored 25 points in an even matchup between the two freshmen.[29] In the Bruins' regular season finale, Ball had a career-high 14 assists in a 77\u201368 win over Washington State, when he also broke Gary Payton's 30-year-old Pac-12 season record for assists by a freshman.[31][32] UCLA was seeded No. 3 in the NCAA tournament, and won their opening game 97\u201380 over Kent State. Ball had 15 points and three assists to surpass Larry Drew II's school record for most assists in a season.[33] In the second round, he came close to a triple-double with 18 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists in a 79\u201367 win over Cincinnati.[34] All of his assists came in the second half, when UCLA overcame a three-point halftime deficit after scoring a season-low 30 points in the first half.[35] The Bruins were eliminated in the Sweet 16, losing 86\u201375 to Kentucky. Ball had 10 points, eight assists, and four turnovers in the loss, while Wildcats point guard De'Aaron Fox scored 39 points for an NCAA tournament freshman record. Ball strained his hamstring in the game but played through it and was limping in the second half. Ball did not offer it as an excuse for being outplayed.[36][37] After the game, he announced that he would declare for the 2017 NBA draft, where he was generally projected to be a top-3 pick.[36]\n\n\nFor the season, Ball averaged 14.6 points, 7.6 assists, and 6.0 rebounds. He was the only player in the nation to average at least 14 points, six assists, and six rebounds, and was the first player in the conference since California's Jason Kidd in 1993\u201394 to average at least 14 points, seven assists, and six rebounds.[38][39] His 274 assists also passed Kidd (272) for the second-most in a season by a Pac-12 player, behind only Ahlon Lewis (294) of Arizona State in 1997\u201398.[40] Ball made 55.1 percent of his field goal attempts and 41.2 of his three-point attempts to become the first NCAA Division I player since 1992\u201393 to make at least 70 percent from the 2-point range and 40 percent from the 3-point range.[41][42] He was a unanimous first-team All-American, earning honors from the Associated Press,[43] United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA),[44] National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC),[45] and *Sporting News*.[46] Additionally, he was awarded the Wayman Tisdale Award by the USBWA as the top freshman in the nation.[47] Ball was the only freshman that year to be a finalist for the Wooden Award, Naismith College Player of the Year, and Oscar Robertson Trophy.[26][44][48] He was also voted Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, named first-team All-Pac-12 along with teammates Leaf and Bryce Alford, and received honorable mention for the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team.[39][49]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2017\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2017\u201318 season: Rookie season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ball in 2018\nBall was selected with the second overall pick of the 2017 NBA draft by his hometown team the Los Angeles Lakers.[50] It was the third straight year they had the No. 2 pick.[51] He and Brandon Ingram, their second overall pick from the previous year, headlined a young core for the Lakers.[52] D'Angelo Russell, their No. 2 pick in 2015, was traded days earlier, partly to clear the way for their newly drafted point guard. Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson billed Ball as \"the new face of the Lakers.\"[53] During the 2017 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, Ball was named the league MVP after averaging 16.3 points, 9.3 assists, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game. He had two triple-doubles, the first in Vegas since 2008 and the first ever in Vegas by a rookie.[54][55] He had four games with 10 or more assists, becoming the first in league history to have more than 10 assists in more than one game; his 9.3 assist average was also a league record.[56][57]\n\n\nAs a rookie in 2017\u201318, Ball played in 52 games, missing 30 games due to shoulder and knee injuries.[58] In the second game of the season on October 20, 2017, he scored a then career-high 29 points, to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists in a 132\u2013130 win against the Phoenix Suns, falling one assist shy of becoming the youngest player to notch a triple double in NBA history.[59] In the following game, he had eight points, eight rebounds, and 13 assists in a 119\u2013112 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, becoming the youngest player in franchise history to get at least 10 assists in a game.[60] On November 11, he recorded 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds in a 98\u201390 loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the youngest player at the time to achieve a triple-double at the age of 20 years and 15 days old, breaking James' record by five days. Leading up to the game, Bucks' coach Jason Kidd, who Ball is often compared to, had called it \"a stretch\" to compare the two since it was too early in Ball's career.[61] Ball, who had been struggling with his shooting,[62] made over 50% of his field goals in a game for the first time in his career.[63][64] On November 19, he recorded his second triple-double with 11 points, 16 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 127\u2013109 win over the Denver Nuggets. It was the most rebounds by an NBA rookie guard since Steve Francis had 17 in 1999\u20132000.[65] He also joined fellow NBA rookie Ben Simmons, as well as Magic Johnson, Connie Hawkins, Art Williams, and Oscar Robertson as the only players to record multiple triple-doubles within the first 20 games of their NBA careers.[66]\n\n\nBall missed the team's Christmas game after spraining his left shoulder in the previous game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[67] He returned after missing six games, playing in five games before spraining the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee against the Dallas Mavericks on January 13, 2018. Originally, he was expected to be sidelined for one to three weeks.[68] Ball was selected to play in the Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend, but withdrew because of the injury.[69] He returned after the All-Star break after missing 15 games. On February 23, he played 17 minutes and had nine points, seven rebounds and six assists in a 124\u2013102 victory against the Mavericks. It was the first game he played all season that he did not start. He was also on a minutes restriction, and the Lakers held him out of their following game to limit his back-to-back games during his return.[70][71] Ball missed the final eight games of the season due to a knee contusion.[72] He ended the season with averages of 10.2 points, 7.2 assists and 6.9 rebounds, but made only 36 percent of his field goals.[73] He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team,[74] while fellow rookie teammate Kyle Kuzma exceeded expectations and earned First Team honors.[73]\n\n\n\n#### 2018\u201319 season: Sophomore season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ball upset during a game in 2018\nOn July 17, 2018, Ball underwent an arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus.[75] During the offseason, the Lakers signed the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player LeBron James, which shifted the spotlight away from Ball.[73] They also signed veteran point guard Rajon Rondo to mentor and compete with the youngster. A week before camp, Lakers coach Luke Walton stated that Ball would be eased back and not participate in full-contact practices initially.[72]\n\n\nBall's added bulk made him better on defense,[3] and he became one of the Lakers' most dynamic defenders during the season as he picked up point guards full-court to create turnovers in the backcourt.[73] On offense, he had to adjust to playing off the ball more with James often handling the ball.[73][76] On December 15, in a 128\u2013100 win against the Charlotte Hornets, the duo became the first teammates to achieve a triple-double in the same game since Jason Kidd and Vince Carter did it in 2007, with Ball posting 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, while James had 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists. The last Lakers teammates to accomplish the feat were Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1982.[77] It was Ball's third triple-double of his career and his first in over a year.[73] On January 19, 2019, he had a career-high seven assists in a quarter to help the Lakers build a 13-point lead over the Houston Rockets after the first period.[58] In the third quarter, he collided with the Rockets' James Ennis III and suffered a Grade 3 left ankle sprain, which included a torn ligament.[78][79] Ball left the game with 11 assists in 22 minutes and the team up by 18 points, but the Lakers lost the game in overtime 138\u2013134.[58][78] He had suffered two other ankle injuries earlier in the season, but had been able to play in all of the team's first 47 games.[80] Since Walton called him out for being passive after a 108\u201386 loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, he had been averaging 13 points, 6.4 rebounds and 8.4 assists with nearly two steals over seven games before the injury.[81] Ball was selected again for the Rising Stars game, but he was ruled out again because of his ankle injury.[82] In late February, he traveled to Ohio to potentially undergo surgery. However, this surgery was not authorized by the Lakers, so the team informed him that his contract could be voided if he proceeded, and successfully talked him out of it.[83] Originally expected to be sidelined for four to six weeks,[78] he was shut down for the rest of the season in March.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### New Orleans Pelicans (2019\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ball playing for the New Orleans Pelicans in 2020.\nOn July 6, 2019, the Lakers traded Ball, Ingram, Josh Hart, the draft rights to De'Andre Hunter, two first-round draft picks, a first-round pick swap and cash to New Orleans in exchange for All-Star Anthony Davis.[86] Ball made his debut for the Pelicans on October 22, registering eight points, five rebounds, and five assists in a 130\u2013122 overtime loss to the defending champion Toronto Raptors.[87] On December 29, he hit a then career-high seven three-pointers, and scored a season-high 27 points, to go with 10 rebounds, and eight assists in a 127\u2013112 win over the Rockets.[88] On January 18, 2020, he recorded his first triple-double of the season with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 133\u2013130 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[89] On March 3, he matched his then career-high seven three-pointers, while recording 26 points and eight assists in a 139\u2013134 loss to the Timberwolves.[90] He also made seven three-pointers the following day, finishing with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and six assists in a 127\u2013123 overtime loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[91] From December 2019 to March 2020, in a 45-game span, he averaged 12.7 points, 7.3 assists, and 6.7 rebounds while shooting 39.2% from three.[92]\n\n\nHeading into the 2020\u201321 season, Ball was at his healthiest.[93] New Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy placed him in a 3-and-D role, which he had never played before.[94] On January 29, 2021, Ball matched his then career-high seven three-pointers, and scored a season-high 27 points, in a 131\u2013126 win over the Bucks.[95] On April 5, Ball set a new career-high eight three-pointers, while matching his season-high 27 points and registering nine assists in a 122\u2013115 win over the Rockets.[96] On May 1, Ball matched his career-high eight three-pointers while recording a career-high 33 points, alongside 11 rebounds and eight assists in a 140\u2013136 OT win against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[97] On May 4, Ball matched his career-high 33 points in a 108\u2013103 win against the Golden State Warriors.[98] He ended the season with career highs in scoring (14.6), 3-point percentage (37.8%), field goal percentage (41.4) and free throw percentage (78.1). In his new role, his assist average dropped to 5.7 per game, near the level he posted while playing alongside LeBron James with the Lakers.[94] New Orleans had power forward Zion Williamson initiate plays off the dribble and handle the ball in transition.[99] Ball became a restricted free agent during the offseason.[94]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 8, 2021, Ball was traded to the Chicago Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal, with the Pelicans receiving Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd, Garrett Temple and draft picks.[100] He signed a four-year, $85 million contract extension with the Bulls.[101] On October 20, Ball made his Bulls debut, putting up 12 points, six rebounds, and four assists in a 94\u201388 win over the Detroit Pistons.[102] On October 22, he put up a triple-double with 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 128\u2013112 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.[103]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2022, after he missed three games with a meniscus tear, the Bulls announced that Ball would undergo surgery on his left knee and miss six to eight weeks.[104] On April 6, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season after experiencing pain during rehabilitation when his physical activity was increased.[105][106] He played in 35 games, the fewest in his career.[107] At the time of his injury, Chicago was 27-13, the best record in the Eastern Conference. Ball was having the best shooting season of his career with career highs in field goal percentage (42%) and 3-point percentage (42%). That season, he was the only NBA player to average five rebounds and five assists and shoot over 40% on 3s.[108]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2023, the Bulls announced that Ball would be out for the remainder of the 2022\u201323 season due to recurring discomfort during participation in basketball activities. Ball did not appear at all in that season.[109] He underwent a cartilage transplant in his left knee on March 16, 2023.[110] In June 2023, Bulls vice president Arturas Karnisovas said that the team does not expect him to be able to play in the 2023\u201324 season.[108]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\u201318 | L.A.

He rotated his right elbow in toward his chest until it reached a 45-degree angle, at which point he shot the ball towards the basket.[111][112][113] Ball preferred to shoot jumpers while moving towards his left.[111][113][114] This led to Ball averaging only 31% shooting from three-point range in his two seasons with the Lakers.[115] Heading into the 2020\u201321 NBA season, videos of Ball's new shooting form emerged. He has been shooting in a more conventional form, with the ball squared up to his forehead and averaged a then career-high 37.5% shooting from three in his first season with the Pelicans.[116][117][118]\n\n\nBall began shooting in games from 40 feet (12\u00a0m) deep when he was a pre-teen.[113] In college, he shot three-pointers from beyond the NBA line, which is 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) longer than the 19-foot-9-inch (6.02\u00a0m) college line. His go-to shot with time expiring was a step-back three-pointer from deep.[119]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nNBA\n* 2\u00d7 Rising Stars Challenge (2018, 2019)\n* NBA All-Rookie Second Team (2018)\n\n\nCollege\n* Associated Press first-team All-American (2017)\n* USBWA first-team All-American (2017)\n* NABC first-team All-American (2017)\n* *Sporting News* first-team All-American (2017)\n* First-team All-Pac-12 (2017)\n* Wayman Tisdale Award (2017)\n* Pac-12 Freshman of the Year (2017)\n* Pac-12 All-Freshman team (2017)[39]\n* Honorable mention Pac-12 All-Defensive Team\n\n\nHigh school\n![](image)Ball making a pass at the 2016 McDonald's All-American game\n* Naismith Prep Player of the Year (2016)\n* Morgan Wootten National Player of the Year (2016)\n* *USA Today* Player of the Year (2016)\n* Mr. Basketball USA (2016)\n* McDonald's All-American (2016)[120]\n* Ballislife All-American (2016)[121]\n* Ballislife All-American Game MVP (2016)[121]\n* California Mr. Basketball (2016)[2]\n* *Los Angeles Times* Player of the Year (2016)[120]\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ball began his pro career using his family's Big Baller Brand gear. Seen here with Kyle Kuzma.\nBall began his pro career using sports apparel from his father LaVar's Big Baller Brand instead of signing with any of the major apparel companies. His father had insisted that he not sign with a company unless they agreed to license merchandise from Big Baller Brand.[122] In May 2017, Big Baller Brand announced the release of Ball's first shoe, the ZO2.[123] The $495 price tag on the shoe sparked wide criticism from celebrities and on social media, in regard to its potential quality in comparison to competing brands such as Nike and Adidas as well as Ball's lack of star power. In response to his critics, LaVar tweeted on May 4, \"If you can't afford the ZO2S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER!\"[124] It was later revealed that despite not being a founder of the company, Lonzo owned 51% of the Big Baller Brand, while his father owned 16.4% of the business and both his mother and Alan Foster, co-founder of Big Baller Brand, owned 16.3% of the business.[125] On April 6, 2018, Jordan Crawford became the first player besides Ball to wear the ZO2s during a game.[126]\n\n\nOn December 20, 2017, Ball was announced as the logo for the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), a league his father LaVar planned to establish for high-school basketball players who have finished high school but want an alternative option to the NCAA. The logo of the JBA is an outline of Ball.[127]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Ball told ESPN that he had cut his ties with BBB's manager and co-founder Alan Foster, accusing him of enriching himself through Ball's business and personal finances. In particular, he stated that $1.5 million of his personal money had gone missing. In addition, the Lakers showed concerns for the quality of BBB's shoes \u2013 believing it was a potential factor in his ankle injuries. Shortly afterward, Ball stripped references to BBB from his social media pages, changed his avatar to a childhood photo of himself wearing a Nike-branded T-shirt, permanently covered up his BBB tattoo, and posted a photograph of himself on Instagram with the caption \"Moving on to bigger and better #MyOwnMan\" [sic].[84][128] Ball and his family have also mentioned the idea of folding the Big Baller Brand altogether in the aftermath of Alan Foster's firing.[129]\n\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\nBall is a rap music enthusiast; in his spare time he writes lyrics on his phone.[130] He has frequently gone to a studio to record music.[131] He has said that he would be a rapper if he was not an NBA player.[132]\n\n\nIn September 2017, Ball released his first rap single, \"Melo Ball 1\", an ode to his youngest brother, LaMelo.[133] During that same month, he released the song \"ZO2\", a dedication to his own brand of shoes. The following month, Ball released another rap single titled \"Super Saiyan\", which is a nod to the anime and manga series *Dragon Ball Z*. In the track, he compares himself to Goku, the main protagonist of *DBZ*.[134] On February 15, 2018, Ball and his father would participate in the *Lip Sync Battle* as competitors.[135] That same day, Ball released his debut album, *Born 2 Ball*, under the name Zo. The album would be released under the Big Baller Music Group, a subsidiary of the Big Baller Brand, run by a close friend of his father.[136] In March, *Born 2 Ball* peaked at No. 42 on *Billboard*'s Independent Albums chart and No. 13 on its Heatseekers Albums chart.[137][138]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ball competed on the fourth season of *The Masked Singer* as \"Whatchamacallit\". He was eliminated on week 8 alongside Dr. Elvis Francois as \"Serpent\".[139]\n\n\n\n### Discography[edit]\n\n\n#### Albums[edit]\n\n\n* 2018: *Born 2 Ball*\n* 2020: *BBA (Bounce Back Album)*\n\n\n#### Singles[edit]\n\n\n* 2017: \"Melo Ball 1\"\n* 2017: \"ZO2\"\n* 2017: \"Super Saiyan\"\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Ball's mother, Tina, suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for two months.[140] In August, he and his family premiered in their own Facebook Watch reality show, *Ball in the Family*.[141]\n\n\nBall was in an on-and-off long-term relationship with Denise Garc\u00eda, with whom he has a daughter.[142]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Lonzo Ball\".

They selected him with the third overall pick, which they received from Philadelphia. He was the Celtics' second straight No. 3 pick for a small forward, following Jaylen Brown in 2016.[41] During the 2017 NBA Summer League event in Utah, he displayed his abilities to effect, averaging 18.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.3 steals, and 2.0 assists in nearly 33 minutes of action. Later, in Las Vegas, Tatum produced similar results, averaging 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 0.8 blocks in nearly 32 minutes of action in the three games he was allowed to play. He was named to the All-Summer League Second Team alongside Bryn Forbes, Cheick Diallo, Wayne Selden Jr., and Kyle Kuzma.[42]\n\n\nIn his NBA debut, Tatum recorded a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds as the team's starting power forward in a 102\u201399 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[43] Tatum then recorded a season-high 24 points in a win over the New York Knicks on October 24, 2017.[44] He was named the Eastern Conference's Rookie of The Month for December 2017.[45]\n\n\nThe Celtics finished the season with a record of 55\u201327, entering the 2018 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference.

Bird held the previous record of four.[53] At the end of his playoff run, he joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only rookies in playoff history to record 10 games of 20 or more points scored during their first playoff runs; LeBron James would praise Tatum's work there, stating: \"He's built for stardom.\"[54]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2018, Tatum was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team (First Team).[55]\n\n\n\n#### 2018\u201319 season: Sophomore season[edit]\n\n\nIn the Celtics 2018\u201319 season opener, Tatum scored 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assist in a 105\u201387 win against the Philadelphia 76ers.[56] On October 20, he scored 24 points and 14 rebounds in a 103\u2013101 victory over the New York Knicks.[57] On October 25, Tatum scored 24 points and 6 rebounds in a 101\u201395 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[58] On November 16, Tatum recorded 21 points and 7 rebounds in a 123\u2013116 overtime win against the Toronto Raptors.[59] On December 25, he scored 23 points and 10 rebounds in a 121\u2013114 overtime win against the Philadelphia 76ers.[60] On February 5, Tatum tallied 25 points and 7 rebounds in a 103\u201396 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[61] On March 6, Tatum scored 24 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assist in a 126\u2013120 win against the Sacramento Kings.[62] During NBA All-Star Weekend, he won the Skills Challenge competition.[63]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u201320 season: First All-Star and All-NBA appearances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tatum with the Celtics in October 2018\nOn December 22, 2019, Tatum scored a then career-high 39 points, along with 12 rebounds, in a 119\u201393 win over the Charlotte Hornets.[64] He would exceed that with a then career-high 41 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in a 140\u2013105 win on January 11, 2020.[65] On January 30, Tatum was named an NBA All-Star for the first time in his career, being selected as an Eastern Conference reserve.[66] On February 13, Tatum would again score 39 points, while playing 47 minutes and leading Boston to a 141\u2013133 double overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers.[67] On February 23, he matched his then career-high 41 points in a 114\u2013112 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.[68] As the season was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Tatum would shoot 2\u201318 against the Milwaukee Bucks on July 31, but he would come back the next game scoring 34 points on 11\u201322 shooting in a 128\u2013124 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on August 2. He was named to the All-NBA Third Team and his first selection of his career.[69]\n\n\nIn the 2020 NBA playoffs, the Celtics were able to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second time in Tatum's three years in the NBA following series victories over the Philadelphia 76ers[70] and Toronto Raptors[71] in four and seven games, respectively. However, Boston was eliminated in those Conference Finals by the Miami Heat in six games.[72] In Game 1, with the Celtics trailing by two in the closing seconds, Tatum's game-tying dunk attempt was blocked by Heat center Bam Adebayo with 4.8 seconds left and prompted Miami to a 117\u2013114 victory.[73]\n\n\n\n#### 2020\u201321 season: Play-in appearance and first round exit[edit]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2020, Tatum and the Celtics agreed to a rookie maximum extension of five years, worth $195 million.[74] On the opening night of the season on December 23, 2020, Tatum totaled 30 points and seven rebounds, alongside a game-winning three-pointer, in a 122\u2013121 win against the Milwaukee Bucks.[75] On January 3, 2021, Tatum had 24 points and a career-high 12 assists and made another game-winning basket in a 122\u2013120 win against the Detroit Pistons.[76] The next day, Tatum scored a season-high 40 points in a 126\u2013114 win against the Toronto Raptors.[77] On January 9, 2021, it was confirmed that Tatum tested positive for COVID-19 and missed multiple games.[78] On 23 February, Tatum was named an Eastern Conference reserve for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game. It was his second All-Star game in a row.[79]\n\n\nOn April 9, Tatum had a then career-high 53 points, 16 made field goals, and 15 made free throws in a 145\u2013136 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. With his career night, Tatum was the youngest Celtics player to score 50+ points; he also scored the third-highest number of points in a Celtics uniform, behind Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, and became the second player in Celtics history to score 50+ points and grab 10+ rebounds since Bird did it back in November 1989.[80][81][82][83] Tatum and Zach LaVine of the Chicago Bulls became the second pair of players in the 2020\u201321 season to score 50+ points on the same day.[84] On April 19, Tatum recorded his first career triple-double with 14 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 102\u201396 loss to the Chicago Bulls.[85]\n\n\nOn May 4, Tatum brought the Celtics back from a 32-point deficit against the San Antonio Spurs, a performance that produced the third-largest comeback in NBA history and gave Tatum a career high of 60 points, tied for the highest points total by a Celtics player (Larry Bird). Tatum was one of three players to score 60+ points without a single turnover and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging 42.7 points per game, 6.0 assists per game, and 6.0 rebounds per game.[86]\n\n\nIn the first game of the play-in tournament on May 18, Tatum scored 50 points, guiding the Celtics to a victory over the Washington Wizards and cementing the team as the seven seed in the Eastern Conference into the 2021 NBA playoffs; Kemba Walker, Tatum's teammate, had 29 points while only one other player (Tristan Thompson) had ten or more points.

He was named Co-MVP alongside Frank Jackson.[11]\n\n\nJackson was a five-star recruit and was regarded as one of the top players in the 2016 high school class.[12][13][14] He was ranked number one in the 2016 class by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, while ESPN ranked him at number two behind only Harry Giles.[15] 247Sports.com ranked him both as the top rated player in the 2016 class along with giving him a 102 rating, the highest rating ever given to a recruit by the website.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes\n| Name\n | Hometown\n | High school / college\n | Height\n | Weight\n | Commit date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Josh Jackson** *G/F* | Southfield, MI\n | Prolific Prep\n | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 195\u00a0lb (88\u00a0kg)\n | Apr 11, 2016\u00a0\n |\n| **Recruiting star ratings:** Scout:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rivals:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0247Sports:![5/5 stars](image) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ESPN grade:\u00a097\n |\n| **Overall recruiting rankings:** Scout: *1* \u00a0\u00a0Rivals: *1*\u00a0\u00a0ESPN: *2* |\n| * \n* *Note*: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height\u00a0and weight.\n* In these cases, the average was taken.

Although he started as a power forward for the Jayhawks, not Jackson's normal positions of both small forward or shooting guard, he still recorded 16.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game with the team in his freshman season.[18] As a result of his efforts, he was named as an All-Big 12 First Team member, the Big 12 Freshman of the Year, was named as a second-team All-American according to Sporting News, and was also considered a third-team All-American according to the Associated Press and National Association of Basketball Coaches. On April 17, 2017, Jackson officially declared for the 2017 NBA draft and hired former Chicago Bulls point guard B. J. Armstrong as his agent, officially forgoing his remaining college eligibility.[19]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2017\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2017\u201318 season[edit]\n\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Jackson was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the fourth pick in the 2017 NBA draft, being their second straight selection at pick #4 after Dragan Bender. After he was drafted 4th by Phoenix, it was reported that Jackson had cancelled his workout with the Boston Celtics, who held the 3rd pick after trading the #1 pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, just as the Celtics management and staff were midway to Sacramento to meet him, something that reportedly angered Celtics general manager Danny Ainge, although Ainge denied that it factored into his decision to not draft Jackson.[20] When questioned on it, Ryan McDonough, the general manager of the Suns, did not deny any collusion between the Suns and Jackson's representatives to dissuade the Celtics from drafting Jackson.[21] However, Jackson attributed the situation to nothing more than poor timing and an inability to reschedule for a more proper date.[22] Jackson would sign his rookie scale contract on July 3, 2017.[23] During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Jackson recorded averages of 17.4 points, a team high 9.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game at 35.0 minutes per game in the five games (out of the team's six total) he played there, which earned him All-Summer League First Team honors alongside Lonzo Ball, Dennis Smith Jr., John Collins, and Caleb Swanigan.[24]\n\n\nJackson made his NBA debut as starting power forward for the Suns on October 18, 2017. During the third game of the season, Jackson made an inappropriate, menacing gesture with his hand towards the fans of the Los Angeles Clippers, which would result in him being fined $35,000 on October 24, 2017. He would start for the Suns at power forward before returning to his more natural small forward position (albeit off the bench) on October 23, 2017 in a win against the Sacramento Kings. On November 29, 2017, Jackson scored a then season-high 20 points in a loss to the Detroit Pistons.[25] Jackson would be put back into a starting position on December 7 at shooting guard after Devin Booker's injury the previous game against the Toronto Raptors.[26] Jackson would record his first double-double of his professional career on January 7, 2018 with 17 points, a season-high 10 rebounds, and a season-high 5 assists in a 114\u2013100 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. After missing their next game against the Houston Rockets due to a strained right hip, he returned to the starting lineup as a small forward on January 14, recording a new career-high 21 points in a blowout loss to the Indiana Pacers. He would tie that career-high on January 31 in a 102\u201388 win over the Dallas Mavericks before putting up a new season-high with 23 points on February 4 in a 115\u2013110 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[27] On his 21st birthday, Jackson would have his best all-around game in his rookie season with 20 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steal and a season-high 4 blocks in a 123\u2013113 loss on the Denver Nuggets. He would break the previous season-high in points with 29 scored on February 28 in a 110\u2013102 win against the Memphis Grizzlies. On St. Patrick's Day, Jackson would break that career-high with the first 30-point game of his professional career with 36 points scored while coming off the bench in a 124\u2013109 loss against the Golden State Warriors. On March 20, 2018, he would record a double-double of 15 points and a career-high 11 rebounds in a loss to the Detroit Pistons. On May 22, 2018, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.[28]\n\n\n\n#### 2018\u201319 season[edit]\n\n\nBefore being named an NBA All-Rookie Second Team member, Jackson was the team's representative for the 2018 NBA Draft Lottery; the Suns won the #1 pick for the first time in franchise history on May 15, 2018.[29] He later joined the top pick, Deandre Ayton, and the Suns' other rookies and young players for the 2018 NBA Summer League. During the entire pre-season, Jackson was forced into the role of the leading shooting guard, trying to replicate the role of Devin Booker, who was out at the time due to finger surgery. In the season debut on October 17, 2018, Jackson returned to the bench for the team, as he recorded 18 points on 7/11 shooting, including 3/4 three-pointers made, in a 121\u2013100 blowout win over the Dallas Mavericks.[30]\n\n\n\n### Memphis Grizzlies (2019\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2019, the Suns traded Jackson to the Memphis Grizzlies.[31] On September 27, the Grizzlies assigned him to the Memphis Hustle, their NBA G League affiliate, for the start of the season.[32] Jackson played in 26 games for the Hustle before being called up by the Grizzlies, averaging 20.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.4 blocks, and 1.3 steals per game was named Midseason All-NBA G League for the Western Conference.[33]\n\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2020\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2020, Jackson signed with his hometown team, the Detroit Pistons.[34] He made his debut for the team on December 23, logging 19 points and six rebounds in a 101\u2013111 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.[35] On April 1, 2021, Jackson scored a season-high 31 points, alongside four assists, in a 120\u201391 win over the Washington Wizards.[36] He ended the 2020\u201321 season averaging a career-high 13.4 points per game.\n\n\nOn January 3, 2022, Jackson scored a season-high 24 points, alongside five rebounds, in a 115\u2013106 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[37]\n\n\n\n### Sacramento Kings (2022)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2022, Jackson and Trey Lyles were acquired by the Sacramento Kings in a four-team trade that sent Marvin Bagley III to the Pistons.[38] The move reunited Jackson with former Suns teammates Richaun Holmes and Alex Len.\n\n\nOn August 31, 2022, Jackson signed with the Toronto Raptors.[39] He was waived on October 14.[40]\n\n\n\n### Stockton Kings (2023)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2023, Jackson signed with the Stockton Kings.[41] He was waived four days later.[42]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games

Apples Jones and his stepfather Clarence Jones, who died in 2014 while Jackson was playing in a tournament in Las Vegas.[43]\nJackson's mother was a standout basketball player at the University of Texas at El Paso, transferring there after two years at Allen Community College in Kansas, but was only able to play for one season after being ruled academically ineligible for her senior year leading her to leave UTEP and join the U.S. Navy as a parachute rigger.[10] Following Jackson's birth, Jones was invited to participate in the Washington Mystics training camp but eventually decided against participating, instead choosing to raise Jackson in Michigan.[10]\n\n\nJackson has cited chess and saxophone as his off the court passions, having started the chess club at Justin-Siena High School and having played the saxophone since he was in the seventh grade.[44][45][46]\n\n\nJackson was arrested in Miami at a Rolling Loud concert on May 12, 2019 for allegedly attempting to enter the VIP entrance several times and reportedly attempting to evade police while being arrested.[47] He was also suspended from the Memphis Grizzlies G-League team for violating the team's rules.\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nOn June 21, the day before the 2017 NBA draft, Jackson signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Under Armour.[48] He was later joined by Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr. and Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson as members of the 2017 draft class to sign with Under Armour.[49]\n\n\n\n### Vandalism case[edit]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2017 it was reported by the Kansas City Star that Jackson and Kansas teammate LaGerald Vick were persons of interest in a vandalism case that had occurred the previous December outside a bar in Lawrence.[50] It was alleged that Jackson and Vick had damaged the car of McKenzie Calvert, a KU women's basketball player and Vick's ex-girlfriend.[51] She told police that during the incident outside the bar, Jackson yelled \"for her to get out of the car and that he would beat her ass\u201d prior to damaging her car.[51] Following the investigation by police, Jackson was charged with one count of misdemeanor criminal damage to property and was scheduled to be arraigned on April 12.[52] Following the announcement of the charges, Jackson released a statement apologizing for his role in the incident and offered to pay for damages.[52] Following Jackson's charges, KU basketball coach Bill Self stated that Jackson had been disciplined internally by the administration but would not be suspended for any games due to his actions in the incident.[52]\n\n\nAfter pleading not guilty to the vandalism charges, Jackson filed for a diversion agreement in Douglas County Court which would last 12 months.[53] As a part of the agreement Jackson agreed to complete an anger management course, complete community service, abstain from alcohol and drug use during the diversion period, obtain substance abuse evaluation and write a letter of apology to the victims.[53] He also agreed to pay $250 in restitution, $158 to the court, and $150 for the cost of diversion.[53] Although Jackson originally pleaded guilty, as a part of the diversion agreement he signed a stipulation of facts matching witness accounts of his actions during the incident.[53] Following the successful completion of the diversion program, Jackson's case would be dismissed by the Douglas County Court.[53] When asked about his progress during an interview on June 13, Jackson told reporters that he was nearly finished with the anger management course and that he had learned from his mistake.[54][55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Josh Jackson Profile\". *University of Kansas Athletics Department*.

This was the second-most points in a playoff debut, after Luka Don\u010di\u0107 who scored 42 points in 2020.[31] On April 19, 2023, Fox was named as the inaugural recipient of the NBA Clutch Player of the Year Award, winning over Jimmy Butler and DeMar DeRozan.[32]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2023, Fox scored a season-high 43 points along with 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 129\u2013120 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[33]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\u201318 | Sacramento | 73 | 60 | 27.8 | .412 | .307 | .726 | 2.8 | 4.4 | 1.0 | .3 | 11.6\n |\n| 2018\u201319 | Sacramento | **81** | **81** | 31.4 | .458 | **.371** | .727 | 3.8 | **7.3** | **1.6** | **.6** | 17.3\n |\n| 2019\u201320 | Sacramento | 51 | 49 | 32.0 | .480 | .292 | .705 | 3.8 | 6.8 | 1.5 | .5 | 21.1\n |\n| 2020\u201321 | Sacramento | 58 | 58 | 35.1 | .477 | .322 | .719 | 3.5 | 7.2 | 1.5 | .5 | **25.2** |\n| 2021\u201322 | Sacramento | 59 | 59 | **35.3** | .473 | .297 | .750 | 3.9 | 5.6 | 1.2 | .4 | 23.2\n |\n| 2022\u201323 | Sacramento | 73 | 73 | 33.6 | **.512** | .324 | **.780** | **4.2** | 6.1 | 1.1 | .3 | 25.0\n |\n| Career\n | 395 | 381 | 32.3 | .472 | .321 | .736 | 3.7 | 6.2 | 1.3 | .4 | 20.2\n |\n| All-Star\n | 1 | 0 | 9.3 | .000 | \u2013 | \u2013 | .0 | 2.0 | .0 | .0 | .0\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023 | Sacramento | 7 | 7 | 38.5 | .424 | .333 | .756 | 5.4 | 7.7 | 2.1 | .6 | 27.4\n |\n| Career\n | 7 | 7 | 38.5 | .424 | .333 | .756 | 5.4 | 7.7 | 2.1 | .6 | 27.4\n |\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\u201317 | Kentucky | 36 | 34 | 29.6 | .479 | .246 | .736 | 4.0 | 4.6 | 1.5 | .2 | 16.7\n |\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nListed at 6\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.91\u00a0m) and 185 pounds (84\u00a0kg),[34] Fox has primarily played the point guard position throughout his career. He is left-handed.\n\n\nComing out of Kentucky, Fox was highly regarded among scouts for his quickness, speed, and athleticism.[35] These attributes combined make Fox one of the most dangerous players on the fast break and driving to the rim. Fox himself stated in 2018 \"If we\u2019re talking about from baseline to baseline with the ball in my hands, I\u2019m definitely the fastest person in the league.\"[36]\n\n\nFox is a high end finisher at the rim, being able to use his body control and leaping ability to finish layups and draw fouls and often using his speed and quickness to blow by defenders. Fox is considered to be a poor 3-point shooter, as during the 2019\u20132020 NBA season, Fox shot a career low 29.2% shooting percentage from three.[37]\n\n\nFox has also demonstrated good passing ability, averaging around seven assists per game.[37] Fox generates most of his assists running the pick and roll and the fast break.\n\n\nOn defense, Fox can be exploited by bigger guards because of his small frame, but can intercept passes and makes quick rotations due to his elite quickness and nearly 6-foot 7 inch wingspan.[38]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFox was born to his parents Aaron and Lorainne Harris-Fox and has one brother named Quentin Fox. Fox goes by the nicknames \u201cFox\u201d, \u201cSwipa\u201d, and \u201cSwipa da Fox\u201d. Fox chose the number zero at Kentucky because he \u201cfears no one\u201d, giving his original number five to teammate Malik Monk.[7] According to his high school coach, Fox would come to school at 6 AM and practice in the gym every morning. Fox would sleep on the couch almost every night and play the *NBA 2K* video game series. This, according to his father, is one of the reasons he has developed into the player that he is today.[39]\n\n\nFox signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike prior to the 2017 NBA draft.[40]\n\n\nFox is also a fan of the *Dragon Ball Z* anime series and says that Vegeta is his favorite character.[41] In 2017, Fox sported *Dragon Ball Z* inspired Nike shoes in game.[42]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Fox was the subject of criticism after he shut down his personal NFT project \u201cSwipaTheFox\u201d, with more than $1.5 million in unpaid investment to approximately 100,000 investors. Fox explained his decision in a Twitter thread, wherein he claimed he wasn't satisfied with the quality of the project so far and was shutting it down until the end of the NBA season, but did not answer critics who demanded a return of their investment.[43][44]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Fox married Recee Caldwell at an elaborate ceremony in Malibu, California. Caldwell gave birth to their son Reign Fox on February 3, 2023.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"De'aaron Fox\". *247 Sports*. 247 Sports.
