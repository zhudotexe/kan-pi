The name of the award honours the Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields.[1]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal is regarded as one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive, and has been described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics,[2][3][4] although there are several major differences, including frequency of award, number of awards, age limits, monetary value, and award criteria.[5] According to the annual Academic Excellence Survey by ARWU, the Fields Medal is consistently regarded as the top award in the field of mathematics worldwide,[6] and in another reputation survey conducted by IREG in 2013\u201314, the Fields Medal came closely after the Abel Prize as the second most prestigious international award in mathematics.[7][8]\n\n\nThe prize includes a monetary award which, since 2006, has been CA$15,000.[9][10] Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal himself, and funding the monetary component, though he died before it was established and his plan was overseen by John Lighton Synge.[1]\n\n\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first female Fields Medalist.[11][12][13] In total, 64 people have been awarded the Fields Medal.\n\n\nThe most recent group of Fields Medalists received their awards on 5 July 2022 in an online event which was live-streamed from Helsinki, Finland. It was originally meant to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n## Conditions of the award[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal has for a long time been regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics and is often described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics.[2][3][4] Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years. The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. The under-40 rule is based on Fields's desire that \"while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.\"[14] Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; winners are ineligible to be awarded future medals.[15]\n\n\nFirst awarded in 1936, 64 people have won the medal as of 2022.[16] With the exception of two PhD holders in physics (Edward Witten and Martin Hairer),[17] only people with a PhD in mathematics have won the medal.[18]\n\n\n\n## List of Fields medalists[edit]\n\n\nIn certain years, the Fields medalists have been officially cited for particular mathematical achievements, while in other years such specificities have not been given. However, in every year that the medal has been awarded, noted mathematicians have lectured at the International Congress of Mathematicians on each medalist's body of work. In the following table, official citations are quoted when possible (namely for the years 1958, 1998, and every year since 2006). For the other years through 1986, summaries of the ICM lectures, as written by Donald Albers, Gerald L. Alexanderson, and Constance Reid, are quoted.[19] In the remaining years (1990, 1994, and 2002), part of the text of the ICM lecture itself has been quoted.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | ICM location\n | Medalists[20] | Affiliation(when awarded)\n | Affiliation(current/last)\n | Reasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936\n | Oslo, Norway\n | ![](image) | Lars Ahlfors | University of Helsinki, Finland\n | Harvard University, US[21][22] | \"Awarded medal for research on covering surfaces related to Riemann surfaces of inverse functions of entire and meromorphic functions.

originally planned to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved online following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The award ceremony for the Fields Medals and prize winner lectures took place in Helsinki, Finland and were live-streamed.[116][117]\n\n## Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to the Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and the American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions.\n\n\nIn 1954, Jean-Pierre Serre became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27.[121] He retains this distinction.[122]\n\n\nIn 1966, Alexander Grothendieck boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe.[123] L\u00e9on Motchane, founder and director of the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, attended and accepted Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf.[124]\n\n\nIn 1970, Sergei Novikov, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Nice to receive his medal.[125]\n\n\nIn 1978, Grigory Margulis, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: \"I cannot but express my deep disappointment\u2014no doubt shared by many people here\u2014in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration.\"[126]\n\n\nIn 1982, the congress was due to be held in Warsaw but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of martial law introduced in Poland on 13 December 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1990, Edward Witten became the first physicist to win the award.[127]\n\n\nIn 1998, at the ICM, Andrew Wiles was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, Yuri I. Manin, with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Don Zagier referred to the plaque as a \"quantized Fields Medal\". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal.[128] Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by Taylor and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.[129][130]\n\n\nIn 2006, Grigori Perelman, who proved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, refused his Fields Medal[9] and did not attend the congress.[131]\n\n\nIn 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first Iranian as well as the first woman to win the Fields Medal, and Artur Avila became the first South American and Manjul Bhargava became the first person of Indian origin to do so.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2022, Maryna Viazovska became the first Ukrainian to win the Fields Medal, and June Huh became the first person of Korean origin to do so.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The reverse of the Fields Medal\nThe medal was designed by Canadian sculptor R. Tait McKenzie.[136] It is made of 14KT gold, has a diameter of 63.5mm, and weighs 169g.[137]\n\n\n\n* On the obverse is Archimedes and a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet Manilius, which reads in Latin: \"Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri\" (\"To surpass one's understanding and master the world\").[138][139] The year number 1933 is written in Roman numerals and contains an error (\"MCNXXXIII\" rather than \"MCMXXXIII\").[140] In capital Greek letters the word \u0391\u03a1\u03a7\u0399\u039c\u0397\u0394\u039f\u03a5\u03a3, or \"of Archimedes,\" is inscribed.\n* On the reverse is the inscription (in Latin):\n\n\n*CONGREGATI*\n*EX TOTO ORBE*\n*MATHEMATICI*\n*OB SCRIPTA INSIGNIA*\n*TRIBUERE*\nTranslation: \"Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: 'this prize'] for outstanding writings.\"\n\n\nIn the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' tomb, with the carving illustrating his theorem On the Sphere and Cylinder, behind an olive branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to 2\u20443.)\n\n\nThe rim bears the name of the prizewinner.[141]\n\n\n\n## Female recipients[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal has had two female recipients, Maryam Mirzakhani from Iran in 2014, and Maryna Viazovska from Ukraine in 2022.[132][134]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal gained some recognition in popular culture due to references in the 1997 film, *Good Will Hunting*. In the movie, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) is an MIT professor who won the award prior to the events of the story. Throughout the film, references made to the award are meant to convey its prestige in the field.[142]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mathematics portal\n\n\n* Abel Prize\n* Kyoto Prize\n* List of prizes known as the Nobel or the highest honors of a field\n* List of mathematics awards\n* Nevanlinna Prize\n* Rolf Schock Prizes\n* Turing Award\n* Wolf Prize in Mathematics\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About Us: The Fields Medal\".

The name of the award honours the Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields.[1]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal is regarded as one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive, and has been described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics,[2][3][4] although there are several major differences, including frequency of award, number of awards, age limits, monetary value, and award criteria.[5] According to the annual Academic Excellence Survey by ARWU, the Fields Medal is consistently regarded as the top award in the field of mathematics worldwide,[6] and in another reputation survey conducted by IREG in 2013\u201314, the Fields Medal came closely after the Abel Prize as the second most prestigious international award in mathematics.[7][8]\n\n\nThe prize includes a monetary award which, since 2006, has been CA$15,000.[9][10] Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal himself, and funding the monetary component, though he died before it was established and his plan was overseen by John Lighton Synge.[1]\n\n\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first female Fields Medalist.[11][12][13] In total, 64 people have been awarded the Fields Medal.\n\n\nThe most recent group of Fields Medalists received their awards on 5 July 2022 in an online event which was live-streamed from Helsinki, Finland. It was originally meant to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n## Conditions of the award[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal has for a long time been regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics and is often described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics.[2][3][4] Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years. The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. The under-40 rule is based on Fields's desire that \"while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.\"[14] Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; winners are ineligible to be awarded future medals.[15]\n\n\nFirst awarded in 1936, 64 people have won the medal as of 2022.[16] With the exception of two PhD holders in physics (Edward Witten and Martin Hairer),[17] only people with a PhD in mathematics have won the medal.[18]\n\n\n\n## List of Fields medalists[edit]\n\n\nIn certain years, the Fields medalists have been officially cited for particular mathematical achievements, while in other years such specificities have not been given. However, in every year that the medal has been awarded, noted mathematicians have lectured at the International Congress of Mathematicians on each medalist's body of work. In the following table, official citations are quoted when possible (namely for the years 1958, 1998, and every year since 2006). For the other years through 1986, summaries of the ICM lectures, as written by Donald Albers, Gerald L. Alexanderson, and Constance Reid, are quoted.[19] In the remaining years (1990, 1994, and 2002), part of the text of the ICM lecture itself has been quoted.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | ICM location\n | Medalists[20] | Affiliation(when awarded)\n | Affiliation(current/last)\n | Reasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936\n | Oslo, Norway\n | ![](image) | Lars Ahlfors | University of Helsinki, Finland\n | Harvard University, US[21][22] | \"Awarded medal for research on covering surfaces related to Riemann surfaces of inverse functions of entire and meromorphic functions.

originally planned to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved online following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The award ceremony for the Fields Medals and prize winner lectures took place in Helsinki, Finland and were live-streamed.[116][117]\n\n## Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to the Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and the American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions.\n\n\nIn 1954, Jean-Pierre Serre became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27.[121] He retains this distinction.[122]\n\n\nIn 1966, Alexander Grothendieck boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe.[123] L\u00e9on Motchane, founder and director of the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, attended and accepted Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf.[124]\n\n\nIn 1970, Sergei Novikov, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Nice to receive his medal.[125]\n\n\nIn 1978, Grigory Margulis, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: \"I cannot but express my deep disappointment\u2014no doubt shared by many people here\u2014in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration.\"[126]\n\n\nIn 1982, the congress was due to be held in Warsaw but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of martial law introduced in Poland on 13 December 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1990, Edward Witten became the first physicist to win the award.[127]\n\n\nIn 1998, at the ICM, Andrew Wiles was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, Yuri I. Manin, with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Don Zagier referred to the plaque as a \"quantized Fields Medal\". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal.[128] Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by Taylor and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.[129][130]\n\n\nIn 2006, Grigori Perelman, who proved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, refused his Fields Medal[9] and did not attend the congress.[131]\n\n\nIn 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first Iranian as well as the first woman to win the Fields Medal, and Artur Avila became the first South American and Manjul Bhargava became the first person of Indian origin to do so.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2022, Maryna Viazovska became the first Ukrainian to win the Fields Medal, and June Huh became the first person of Korean origin to do so.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The reverse of the Fields Medal\nThe medal was designed by Canadian sculptor R. Tait McKenzie.[136] It is made of 14KT gold, has a diameter of 63.5mm, and weighs 169g.[137]\n\n\n\n* On the obverse is Archimedes and a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet Manilius, which reads in Latin: \"Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri\" (\"To surpass one's understanding and master the world\").[138][139] The year number 1933 is written in Roman numerals and contains an error (\"MCNXXXIII\" rather than \"MCMXXXIII\").[140] In capital Greek letters the word \u0391\u03a1\u03a7\u0399\u039c\u0397\u0394\u039f\u03a5\u03a3, or \"of Archimedes,\" is inscribed.\n* On the reverse is the inscription (in Latin):\n\n\n*CONGREGATI*\n*EX TOTO ORBE*\n*MATHEMATICI*\n*OB SCRIPTA INSIGNIA*\n*TRIBUERE*\nTranslation: \"Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: 'this prize'] for outstanding writings.\"\n\n\nIn the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' tomb, with the carving illustrating his theorem On the Sphere and Cylinder, behind an olive branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to 2\u20443.)\n\n\nThe rim bears the name of the prizewinner.[141]\n\n\n\n## Female recipients[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal has had two female recipients, Maryam Mirzakhani from Iran in 2014, and Maryna Viazovska from Ukraine in 2022.[132][134]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal gained some recognition in popular culture due to references in the 1997 film, *Good Will Hunting*. In the movie, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) is an MIT professor who won the award prior to the events of the story. Throughout the film, references made to the award are meant to convey its prestige in the field.[142]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mathematics portal\n\n\n* Abel Prize\n* Kyoto Prize\n* List of prizes known as the Nobel or the highest honors of a field\n* List of mathematics awards\n* Nevanlinna Prize\n* Rolf Schock Prizes\n* Turing Award\n* Wolf Prize in Mathematics\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About Us: The Fields Medal\".

In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nLindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German Jewish origins, the son of the mathematician Joram Lindenstrauss, the namesake of the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma, and computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss, both professors at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the Hebrew University Secondary School. In 1988 he was awarded a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He enlisted to the IDF's Talpiot program, and studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he earned his BSc in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and his master's degree in mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being \"Entropy properties of dynamical systems\", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, then a Szego Assistant Prof. at Stanford University. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[3] Lindenstrauss is an editor for Duke Mathematical Journal and Journal d'Analyse Math\u00e9matique.[4][5]\n\n\nLindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of ergodic theory and its applications in number theory. With Anatole Katok and Manfred Einsiedler, he made progress on the Littlewood conjecture.[6]\n\n\nIn a series of two papers (one co-authored with Jean Bourgain) he made major progress on Peter Sarnak's Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by Kannan Soundararajan.\n\n\nRecently with Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel and Akshay Venkatesh, he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by Hermann Minkowski and Yuri Linnik.\n\n\nTogether with Benjamin Weiss he developed and studied systematically the invariant of mean dimension[7] introduced in 1999 by Mikhail Gromov.[8] In related work he introduced and studied the small boundary property and stated fundamental conjectures.[9]\n\n\nAmong his co-authors are Jean Bourgain, Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel, Shahar Mozes, Akshay Venkatesh and Barak Weiss.\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Lindenstrauss represented Israel in the International Mathematical Olympiad and won a bronze medal.\n* During his service in the IDF, he was awarded the Israel Defense Prize.\n* In 2003, he was awarded the Salem Prize jointly with Kannan Soundararajan.\n* In 2004, he was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize.\n* In 2008, he received the Michael Bruno Memorial Award.\n* In 2009, he was awarded the Erd\u0151s Prize.\n* In 2009, he received the Fermat Prize.\n* In 2010, he became the first Israeli to be awarded the Fields Medal, *for his results on measure rigidity in ergodic theory, and their applications to number theory*.[10]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Israeli wins world's most prestigious math prize\". *ynet*. 19 August 2010.

He is the first Vietnamese national to have received the Fields Medal.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u was born in 1972, the son of an intellectual family in Hanoi, North Vietnam. His father, professor Ng\u00f4 Huy C\u1ea9n, is full professor of physics at the Vietnam National Institute of Mechanics. His mother, Tr\u1ea7n L\u01b0u V\u00e2n Hi\u1ec1n, is a physician and associate professor at an herbal medicine hospital in Hanoi.\n\n\nThe beginning of Ch\u00e2u's schooling was at an experimental elementary school that had been founded by the revolutionary pedagogue H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc \u0110\u1ea1i, but when his father returned from the Soviet Union with his doctoral degree, he decided that Ch\u00e2u would learn more in traditional schools and enrolled him in the \"chuy\u00ean to\u00e1n\" (special classes for gifted students in mathematics) at the Tr\u01b0ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng Middle School.[9]\nAt age 15, Ch\u00e2u entered the special mathematics class at the High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science (Kh\u1ed1i chuy\u00ean T\u1ed5ng H\u1ee3p\u00a0\u2013 \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc Khoa H\u1ecdc T\u1ef1 Nhi\u00ean H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i[10]), formerly known as the A0-class. In grades 11 and 12, Ch\u00e2u participated in the 29th and 30th International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) and became the first Vietnamese student to win two IMO gold medals,[11] of which the first one was won with a perfect score (42/42).[12]\n\n\nAfter high school, Ch\u00e2u expected to study in Budapest, but in the aftermath of the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, the new Hungarian government halted scholarships to students from Vietnam.[13] After visiting Ch\u00e2u's father, Paul Germain, secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, arranged for Ch\u00e2u to study in France. He was offered a scholarship by the French government for undergraduate study at the Paris VI University, then in 1992, he entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He obtained a PhD in 1997 from the Universite Paris-Sud under the supervision of G\u00e9rard Laumon. He became a member of CNRS at Paris 13 University from 1998 to 2005, and defended his habilitation degree there in 2003. He holds both Vietnamese and French citizenship.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nCh\u00e2u became a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University in 2005. In 2005, at age 33, Chau received the title of professor in Vietnam, becoming the country's youngest-ever professor.[12] Since 2007, Ch\u00e2u has worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, as well as the Hanoi Institute of Mathematics.[15] He joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago on September 1, 2010. In addition, since 2011 he has been Scientific Director of the newly founded Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (VIASM).[16] In 2016 Ch\u00e2u was Co-General Chair of Asiacrypt the first time that the Asian cryptography conference was held in Vietnam.[17]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nCh\u00e2u first came to prominence by proving, in joint work with G\u00e9rard Laumon, the fundamental lemma for unitary groups. Their general strategy was to understand the local orbital integrals appearing in the fundamental lemma in terms of affine Springer fibers arising in the Hitchin fibration. This allowed them to employ the tools of geometric representation theory, namely the theory of perverse sheaves, to study what was initially a combinatorial problem of a number-theoretic nature. Chau eventually succeeded in formulating the proof for the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras in 2008.[12] Together with earlier results from Jean-Loup Waldspurger, who had shown that the full fundamental lemma results from this then missing result, this completed the proof of the fundamental lemma in all cases. As a result, Ch\u00e2u was awarded a Fields Medal in 2010.\n\n\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u was the co-author of the Vietnamese children's book *Ai and Ky in the land of the invisible numbers*.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Ch\u00e2u and Laumon were awarded the Clay Research Award for their achievement in solving the fundamental lemma for the case of unitary groups.[12] Ch\u00e2u's proof of the general case was selected by *Time* as one of the Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of 2009.[15] In 2010, he received the Fields Medal. By decree on 22 April 2011, he was awarded a Knight of France's Legion of Honour.[18] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[19] In 2021, he became an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Major publications[edit]\n\n\n* Ng\u00f4, Bao Ch\u00e2u. *Le lemme fondamental pour les alg\u00e8bres de Lie.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2010. His research involves complex analysis, dynamical systems and probability theory.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov's Ph.D. was conducted at Caltech under advisor Nikolai Makarov. In 1998 he was employed as part of the faculty at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, after which he took up his second position as a professor in the Analysis, Mathematical Physics and Probability group at the University of Geneva in 2003.[3][4] In 2010, Smirnov became the founding director of the Chebyshev Laboratory in Saint Petersburg State University in Russia.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov has worked on percolation theory, where he proved Cardy's formula for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice, and deduced conformal invariance.[5] The conjecture was proved in the special case of site percolation on the triangular lattice.[6] Smirnov's theorem has led to a fairly complete theory for percolation on the triangular lattice, and to its relationship to the Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution introduced by Oded Schramm. He also established conformality for the two-dimensional critical Ising model.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov was awarded the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society Prize (1997), the Clay Research Award (2001), the Salem Prize (joint with Oded Schramm, 2001), the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Prize (2001), the Rollo Davidson Prize (2002), and the Prize of the European Mathematical Society (2004).[3] In 2010 Smirnov was awarded the Fields medal for his work on the mathematical foundations of statistical physics, particularly finite lattice models.[8] His citation reads \"for the proof of conformal invariance of percolation and the planar Ising model in statistical physics\".[9]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* *Probability and Statistical Physics in St. Petersburg*, American Math Society, (2015)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Stanislav Smirnov's publications on Google Scholar\".\n2. **^** \"Stanislav Smirnov's home page\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"La M\u00e9daille Fields pour un professeur de l'UNIGE\". *University of Geneva press releases* (in French).

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2010, and he was the director of Sorbonne University's Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 from 2009 to 2017. As of September 2022, he is a professor at Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques.\n\n\nVillani has given two lectures at the Royal Institution, the first titled 'Birth of a Theorem'.[2] The English translation of his book *Th\u00e9or\u00e8me vivant* (*Living Theorem*) has the same title. \nIn the book he describes the links between his research on kinetic theory and the one of the mathematician Carlo Cercignani: Villani, in fact, proved the so-called Cercignani's conjecture.\n\n\nHis second lecture at the Royal Institution is titled 'The Extraordinary Theorems of John Nash'.[3]\n\n\nVillani was elected as the deputy for Essonne's 5th constituency in the National Assembly, the lower house of the French Parliament, during the 2017 legislative election.[4] He was elected as a member of La R\u00e9publique En Marche! (LREM), but in May 2020 left the party to form a new party, Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity (EDS).[5][6] Following the dissolution of EDS, Villani joined Ecology Generation, and ran for re-election under the banner of the NUPES.[7] He was elected Vice President of the French Parliamentary Office for the Evaluation of Scientific and Technological Choices in July 2017.\n\n\nHe lost his seat in the 2022 French legislative election to La Republique En Marche! candidate Paul Midy by 19 votes.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nAfter attending the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, Villani was admitted at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris and studied there from 1992 to 1996, after which he was appointed an agr\u00e9g\u00e9 pr\u00e9parateur at the same school.[9] He received his doctorate at Paris Dauphine University in 1998, under the supervision of Pierre-Louis Lions, and became professor at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon in 2000. He is now professor at the University of Lyon. He was director of the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris from 2009 to 2017.[10][11]\n\n\nHe has held various visiting positions at Georgia Tech (Fall 1999), the University of California, Berkeley (Spring 2004), and the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (Spring 2009).[12]\n\n\n\n## Mathematical work[edit]\n\n\nVillani has worked on the theory of partial differential equations involved in statistical mechanics, specifically the Boltzmann equation, where, with Laurent Desvillettes, he was the first to prove how quickly convergence occurs for initial values not near equilibrium.[11] He has written with Giuseppe Toscani on this subject. With Cl\u00e9ment Mouhot, he has worked on nonlinear Landau damping.[13] He has worked on the theory of optimal transport and its applications to differential geometry, and with John Lott has defined a notion of bounded Ricci curvature for general measured length spaces.[14] He also served on the Mathematical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\nVillani received the Fields Medal for his work on Landau damping and the Boltzmann equation.[11] He described the development of his theorem in his autobiographical book *Th\u00e9or\u00e8me vivant* (2012), published in English translation as *Birth of a Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure* (2015).[15][16] He gave a TED talk at the 2016 conference in Vancouver.[17]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)C\u00e9dric Villani at a public meeting of En Marche in Tokyo\nIn 2017, it was announced that Villani had been selected as a candidate for *En Marche!* (LREM) in the 2017 French legislative election, for Essonne's 5th constituency.[18][19] In the first round of voting, Villani obtained 47% of the vote and was thus strongly placed for the second round[20] which he won with 69.36% of the vote.[21]\n\n\nIn 2019, Villani applied to be selected to lead the LREM candidate slate for the 2020 Paris election. By July 2019, he was one of three LREM candidates, all deputies in the National Assembly, still seeking the position; the other two were Benjamin Griveaux (who had been the government spokesperson) and Hugues Renson (who had been the vice-president of the National Assembly). On 10 July, the nomination committee picked Griveaux.[22] On 4 September, Villani officially announced his candidacy for the municipal election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n* France China Foundation, former Member of the Strategic Committee[24]\n\n\n## Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n### Diplomas, titles and awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1998: PhD Thesis (advisor P.-L.

In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nLindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German Jewish origins, the son of the mathematician Joram Lindenstrauss, the namesake of the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma, and computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss, both professors at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the Hebrew University Secondary School. In 1988 he was awarded a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He enlisted to the IDF's Talpiot program, and studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he earned his BSc in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and his master's degree in mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being \"Entropy properties of dynamical systems\", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, then a Szego Assistant Prof. at Stanford University. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[3] Lindenstrauss is an editor for Duke Mathematical Journal and Journal d'Analyse Math\u00e9matique.[4][5]\n\n\nLindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of ergodic theory and its applications in number theory. With Anatole Katok and Manfred Einsiedler, he made progress on the Littlewood conjecture.[6]\n\n\nIn a series of two papers (one co-authored with Jean Bourgain) he made major progress on Peter Sarnak's Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by Kannan Soundararajan.\n\n\nRecently with Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel and Akshay Venkatesh, he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by Hermann Minkowski and Yuri Linnik.\n\n\nTogether with Benjamin Weiss he developed and studied systematically the invariant of mean dimension[7] introduced in 1999 by Mikhail Gromov.[8] In related work he introduced and studied the small boundary property and stated fundamental conjectures.[9]\n\n\nAmong his co-authors are Jean Bourgain, Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel, Shahar Mozes, Akshay Venkatesh and Barak Weiss.\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Lindenstrauss represented Israel in the International Mathematical Olympiad and won a bronze medal.\n* During his service in the IDF, he was awarded the Israel Defense Prize.\n* In 2003, he was awarded the Salem Prize jointly with Kannan Soundararajan.\n* In 2004, he was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize.\n* In 2008, he received the Michael Bruno Memorial Award.\n* In 2009, he was awarded the Erd\u0151s Prize.\n* In 2009, he received the Fermat Prize.\n* In 2010, he became the first Israeli to be awarded the Fields Medal, *for his results on measure rigidity in ergodic theory, and their applications to number theory*.[10]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Israeli wins world's most prestigious math prize\". *ynet*. 19 August 2010.

He is the first Vietnamese national to have received the Fields Medal.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u was born in 1972, the son of an intellectual family in Hanoi, North Vietnam. His father, professor Ng\u00f4 Huy C\u1ea9n, is full professor of physics at the Vietnam National Institute of Mechanics. His mother, Tr\u1ea7n L\u01b0u V\u00e2n Hi\u1ec1n, is a physician and associate professor at an herbal medicine hospital in Hanoi.\n\n\nThe beginning of Ch\u00e2u's schooling was at an experimental elementary school that had been founded by the revolutionary pedagogue H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc \u0110\u1ea1i, but when his father returned from the Soviet Union with his doctoral degree, he decided that Ch\u00e2u would learn more in traditional schools and enrolled him in the \"chuy\u00ean to\u00e1n\" (special classes for gifted students in mathematics) at the Tr\u01b0ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng Middle School.[9]\nAt age 15, Ch\u00e2u entered the special mathematics class at the High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science (Kh\u1ed1i chuy\u00ean T\u1ed5ng H\u1ee3p\u00a0\u2013 \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc Khoa H\u1ecdc T\u1ef1 Nhi\u00ean H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i[10]), formerly known as the A0-class. In grades 11 and 12, Ch\u00e2u participated in the 29th and 30th International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) and became the first Vietnamese student to win two IMO gold medals,[11] of which the first one was won with a perfect score (42/42).[12]\n\n\nAfter high school, Ch\u00e2u expected to study in Budapest, but in the aftermath of the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, the new Hungarian government halted scholarships to students from Vietnam.[13] After visiting Ch\u00e2u's father, Paul Germain, secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, arranged for Ch\u00e2u to study in France. He was offered a scholarship by the French government for undergraduate study at the Paris VI University, then in 1992, he entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He obtained a PhD in 1997 from the Universite Paris-Sud under the supervision of G\u00e9rard Laumon. He became a member of CNRS at Paris 13 University from 1998 to 2005, and defended his habilitation degree there in 2003. He holds both Vietnamese and French citizenship.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nCh\u00e2u became a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University in 2005. In 2005, at age 33, Chau received the title of professor in Vietnam, becoming the country's youngest-ever professor.[12] Since 2007, Ch\u00e2u has worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, as well as the Hanoi Institute of Mathematics.[15] He joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago on September 1, 2010. In addition, since 2011 he has been Scientific Director of the newly founded Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (VIASM).[16] In 2016 Ch\u00e2u was Co-General Chair of Asiacrypt the first time that the Asian cryptography conference was held in Vietnam.[17]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nCh\u00e2u first came to prominence by proving, in joint work with G\u00e9rard Laumon, the fundamental lemma for unitary groups. Their general strategy was to understand the local orbital integrals appearing in the fundamental lemma in terms of affine Springer fibers arising in the Hitchin fibration. This allowed them to employ the tools of geometric representation theory, namely the theory of perverse sheaves, to study what was initially a combinatorial problem of a number-theoretic nature. Chau eventually succeeded in formulating the proof for the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras in 2008.[12] Together with earlier results from Jean-Loup Waldspurger, who had shown that the full fundamental lemma results from this then missing result, this completed the proof of the fundamental lemma in all cases. As a result, Ch\u00e2u was awarded a Fields Medal in 2010.\n\n\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u was the co-author of the Vietnamese children's book *Ai and Ky in the land of the invisible numbers*.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Ch\u00e2u and Laumon were awarded the Clay Research Award for their achievement in solving the fundamental lemma for the case of unitary groups.[12] Ch\u00e2u's proof of the general case was selected by *Time* as one of the Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of 2009.[15] In 2010, he received the Fields Medal. By decree on 22 April 2011, he was awarded a Knight of France's Legion of Honour.[18] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[19] In 2021, he became an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Major publications[edit]\n\n\n* Ng\u00f4, Bao Ch\u00e2u. *Le lemme fondamental pour les alg\u00e8bres de Lie.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2010. His research involves complex analysis, dynamical systems and probability theory.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov's Ph.D. was conducted at Caltech under advisor Nikolai Makarov. In 1998 he was employed as part of the faculty at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, after which he took up his second position as a professor in the Analysis, Mathematical Physics and Probability group at the University of Geneva in 2003.[3][4] In 2010, Smirnov became the founding director of the Chebyshev Laboratory in Saint Petersburg State University in Russia.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov has worked on percolation theory, where he proved Cardy's formula for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice, and deduced conformal invariance.[5] The conjecture was proved in the special case of site percolation on the triangular lattice.[6] Smirnov's theorem has led to a fairly complete theory for percolation on the triangular lattice, and to its relationship to the Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution introduced by Oded Schramm. He also established conformality for the two-dimensional critical Ising model.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov was awarded the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society Prize (1997), the Clay Research Award (2001), the Salem Prize (joint with Oded Schramm, 2001), the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Prize (2001), the Rollo Davidson Prize (2002), and the Prize of the European Mathematical Society (2004).[3] In 2010 Smirnov was awarded the Fields medal for his work on the mathematical foundations of statistical physics, particularly finite lattice models.[8] His citation reads \"for the proof of conformal invariance of percolation and the planar Ising model in statistical physics\".[9]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* *Probability and Statistical Physics in St. Petersburg*, American Math Society, (2015)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Stanislav Smirnov's publications on Google Scholar\".\n2. **^** \"Stanislav Smirnov's home page\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"La M\u00e9daille Fields pour un professeur de l'UNIGE\". *University of Geneva press releases* (in French).

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2010, and he was the director of Sorbonne University's Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 from 2009 to 2017. As of September 2022, he is a professor at Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques.\n\n\nVillani has given two lectures at the Royal Institution, the first titled 'Birth of a Theorem'.[2] The English translation of his book *Th\u00e9or\u00e8me vivant* (*Living Theorem*) has the same title. \nIn the book he describes the links between his research on kinetic theory and the one of the mathematician Carlo Cercignani: Villani, in fact, proved the so-called Cercignani's conjecture.\n\n\nHis second lecture at the Royal Institution is titled 'The Extraordinary Theorems of John Nash'.[3]\n\n\nVillani was elected as the deputy for Essonne's 5th constituency in the National Assembly, the lower house of the French Parliament, during the 2017 legislative election.[4] He was elected as a member of La R\u00e9publique En Marche! (LREM), but in May 2020 left the party to form a new party, Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity (EDS).[5][6] Following the dissolution of EDS, Villani joined Ecology Generation, and ran for re-election under the banner of the NUPES.[7] He was elected Vice President of the French Parliamentary Office for the Evaluation of Scientific and Technological Choices in July 2017.\n\n\nHe lost his seat in the 2022 French legislative election to La Republique En Marche! candidate Paul Midy by 19 votes.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nAfter attending the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, Villani was admitted at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris and studied there from 1992 to 1996, after which he was appointed an agr\u00e9g\u00e9 pr\u00e9parateur at the same school.[9] He received his doctorate at Paris Dauphine University in 1998, under the supervision of Pierre-Louis Lions, and became professor at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon in 2000. He is now professor at the University of Lyon. He was director of the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris from 2009 to 2017.[10][11]\n\n\nHe has held various visiting positions at Georgia Tech (Fall 1999), the University of California, Berkeley (Spring 2004), and the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (Spring 2009).[12]\n\n\n\n## Mathematical work[edit]\n\n\nVillani has worked on the theory of partial differential equations involved in statistical mechanics, specifically the Boltzmann equation, where, with Laurent Desvillettes, he was the first to prove how quickly convergence occurs for initial values not near equilibrium.[11] He has written with Giuseppe Toscani on this subject. With Cl\u00e9ment Mouhot, he has worked on nonlinear Landau damping.[13] He has worked on the theory of optimal transport and its applications to differential geometry, and with John Lott has defined a notion of bounded Ricci curvature for general measured length spaces.[14] He also served on the Mathematical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\nVillani received the Fields Medal for his work on Landau damping and the Boltzmann equation.[11] He described the development of his theorem in his autobiographical book *Th\u00e9or\u00e8me vivant* (2012), published in English translation as *Birth of a Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure* (2015).[15][16] He gave a TED talk at the 2016 conference in Vancouver.[17]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)C\u00e9dric Villani at a public meeting of En Marche in Tokyo\nIn 2017, it was announced that Villani had been selected as a candidate for *En Marche!* (LREM) in the 2017 French legislative election, for Essonne's 5th constituency.[18][19] In the first round of voting, Villani obtained 47% of the vote and was thus strongly placed for the second round[20] which he won with 69.36% of the vote.[21]\n\n\nIn 2019, Villani applied to be selected to lead the LREM candidate slate for the 2020 Paris election. By July 2019, he was one of three LREM candidates, all deputies in the National Assembly, still seeking the position; the other two were Benjamin Griveaux (who had been the government spokesperson) and Hugues Renson (who had been the vice-president of the National Assembly). On 10 July, the nomination committee picked Griveaux.[22] On 4 September, Villani officially announced his candidacy for the municipal election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n* France China Foundation, former Member of the Strategic Committee[24]\n\n\n## Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n### Diplomas, titles and awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1998: PhD Thesis (advisor P.-L.
