Previously known as Batavia, it wasÂ the *de facto* capital of the Dutch East Indies. In the early 20th century, the Dutch East Indies government attempted to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung.[2] During Indonesia's struggle for independence, the Indonesian government moved the capital to Yogyakarta and then to Bukittinggi, where it remained for a short time until the restoration of control to Jakarta.[3] In 2019, during his annual state of the union address at the parliament, President Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate the capital to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.[4] As part of the plan, part of Kutai Kartanegara Regency and Penajam North Paser Regency in East Kalimantan will be carved out to create a new province-level planned city, and the capital will be relocated to a more central location within Indonesia. On 17 January 2022, the name was revealed to be Nusantara.[5]\n\n\nThe plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta's burden as Indonesia's primary hub.[6][7][8] In August 2019, the government announced that while the capital will be moved, $40 billion will be spent on saving Jakarta from sinking in the next decade.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![Capital of Indonesia is located in Indonesia](image)![Jakarta](image)\nJakarta\n![Yogyakarta](image)\nYogyakarta\n![Bukittinggi](image)\nBukittinggi\n![Nusantara](image)\nNusantara\nclass=notpageimage|\nCapitals of Indonesia throughout history\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Capital\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 17 August 1945 | Jakarta | Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed the independence of Indonesia in Jakarta, which became the *de facto* capital of the Republic of Indonesia.\n |\n| 4 January 1946 | Yogyakarta | Jakarta was occupied by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) and the capital was moved to Yogyakarta.

The poor sanitation and weak water drainage system made the city unhealthy, and it was infested with malaria, cholera, and dysentery. In 1808, Daendels decided to quit the by-then dilapidated and unhealthy Old Town. A new town centre was subsequently built further to the south, near the estate of Weltevreden. Batavia thereby became a city with two centres: Kota, as the hub of business, where the offices and warehouses of shipping and trading companies were located; and Weltevreden, the new home for the government, military, and shops. These two centres were connected by the Molenvliet Canal and a road (now Gajah Mada Road) that ran alongside the waterway.[13]\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Dutch East Indies government decided to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The idea was to separate the busy trading port and the commercial centre (Batavia) from the new administrative and political centre (Bandung). By the 1920s the plan to transfer the capital to Bandung was underway. As the city began the master plan of a new city, some government buildings, telecommunication (now Telkom Indonesia), railway networks (now Kereta Api Indonesia), a postal system (now Pos Indonesia), defence-military headquarters, and more were constructed and headquartered in Bandung. Some are still here to this day, such as Gedung Sate, which was planned as the government administrative centre of the Dutch East Indies. The plan, however, failed due to the Great Depression and the outbreak of World War II.[2]\n\n\nOn 5 March 1942, Batavia fell to the Japanese. The Dutch formally surrendered to the Japanese occupation forces on 9 March 1942, and the colony's rule was transferred to Japan. The city was renamed Jakarta (officially ã¸ã£ã«ã«ã¿ç¹å¥å¸ *Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi*, Special Municipality of Jakarta, under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the collapse of Japan in 1945, the area went through a period of transition and upheaval during the Indonesian national struggle for independence. During the Japanese occupation and from the perspective of the Indonesian nationalists who declared independence on 17 August 1945, the city was once again renamed Jakarta.[14]\n\n\nFollowing the surrender of the Japanese, Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945. The proclamation was enacted at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56 (now Jalan Proklamasi), Central Jakarta, with Suwiryo acting as the committee chairman. Suwiryo was recognised as the first mayor of Jakarta Tokubetsu Shi. The position was soon altered to *Pemerintah Nasional Kota Jakarta* (\"Jakarta City National Administration\"). On 19 September 1945, Sukarno held an Indonesian independence and anti-colonialism/imperialism speech during *Rapat Akbar*, or grand meeting, at Lapangan Ikada, now the Merdeka Square. The grand meeting would start a period of national revolution in Indonesia.[15]\n\n\n\n## National revolution period[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Indonesian struggle for independence (1945â1949), prompted by political and military emergencies, the capital of the republic was moved several times, as the seat of the republic in exile during the war. The capital moved from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (1946â1948) and then to Bukittinggi (1948â1949) as the seat of the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia.[3] In 1949, the national capital of the republic returned to Jakarta.\n\n\n\n## Jakarta as the *de jure* capital of Indonesia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monas stands in the centre of Merdeka Square, in the heart of the national capital of Jakarta. Most of Jakarta's landmarks and monuments were built during the Sukarno era.\nDuring Sukarno's presidency, Jakarta was established and developed as the capital of the new republic. In 1957, Sukarno laid the foundation and street grid layout of Palangkaraya as a new planned capital of Central Kalimantan province. Sukarno however, foresaw the new city as the possible new national capital in the future. The vast available area and its geographic location in the centre of the archipelago was the city's main advantage. Nevertheless, Sukarno seemed to favour Jakarta instead. In the late 1950s to the first half of the 1960s, he filled Jakarta with monuments and statues. Numbers of monumental projects were conceived, planned, and initiated during his administration, including Monumen Nasional, Istiqlal mosque, DPR/MPR Building, and Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also filled Jakarta with nationalistic monuments and statues, including Selamat Datang Monument, Dirgantara Monument at Pancoran, and the West Irian Liberation Monument at Lapangan Banteng. Although many of the projects were completed later, Sukarno is credited for shaping Jakarta's monuments and landmarks. He desired Jakarta to be the beacon of a powerful new nation.[16]\n\n\nIn 1966, Jakarta was granted its official status as DKI (*Daerah Khusus Ibukota*) Djakarta, or the Special Capital Region. It promoted the rate of development of government office buildings and foreign embassies. Jakarta's rapid development created the need for a master plan to regulate Jakarta's growth. Since 1966, Jakarta has steadily grown into a modern metropolis.[17]\n\n\nDuring the highly centralised New Order regime of Sukarno's successor Suharto, Jakarta was further established as the political and economic core of the nation. Prompted by rapid development and urbanisation, Jakarta attracted large numbers of new settlers from all over the archipelago, with the majority coming from rural Javanese towns. High-rise buildings sprung up, especially in Jakarta's commercial and financial centres along Thamrin, Sudirman, and Kuningan avenues. As a result, since the 1970s, the population of Jakarta has spiked tremendously and spilled into areas surrounding the capital. The Jabodetabek, or Greater Jakarta, region has become the largest and the most densely populated urban agglomeration in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## New capital proposals throughout the decades[edit]\n\n\nProposals to move the Indonesian capital from Jakarta to other locations have been discussed since the Sukarno presidency. Massive overpopulation, a lack of urban infrastructures such as public transportation facilities, gridlock traffic, encroachment of urban areas replacing open green spaces, spread of slums within the city, over-extraction of groundwater, and poor water drainage systems have led to Jakarta's ecological degradation. As groundwater was depleted, the city slowly sank lower; parts of Northern Jakarta are below sea level and regularly encounter floods. Jakarta experienced massive floods in 2007 and 2013. In 2010, the debate about the creation of a new capital that would be separated from the urban, economic, and commercial centre of the country continued. Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono supported the idea to create a new political and administrative centre of Indonesia due to Jakarta's environmental and overpopulation problems.[18][19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Monument built to inaugurate the groundbreaking of Palangkaraya by President Sukarno, dated 17 July 1957. This monument is colloquially known locally as the *Sukarno Monument*.\nTwo major alternative approaches have been raised over the years:[20] One was to move the national capital altogether by creating an entirely new planned city, similar to the relocation of the Brazilian capital from Rio de Janeiro to the planned city of Brasilia in 1960. The other approach was to keep Jakarta as the official capital but to create a separate administrative centre, similar to when Malaysia moved its federal administrative centre to Putrajaya. Suggested locations for the first proposal include:\n\n\n\n* Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan. Since it was established as the capital of Central Kalimantan province in 1957, the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, outlined a plan to develop Palangkaraya as the future capital of Indonesia.[21] Palangkaraya is far more extensive in area than Jakarta and is safe from the danger of earthquakes and volcanoes, which are common on Java.[22]\n* Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan. Compared to Palangkaraya, Banjarmasin is located closer to the centre of the country, has better access to the Java Sea, and has better infrastructure.[22]\n* Kota Merdeka is a proposed planned city located north of Pangkalan Bun town, West Kotawaringin Regency, Central Kalimantan. Compared to far inland Palangkaraya, Kota Merdeka is located nearer to coastal areas and has better access to the Java Sea.[23]\n* Pontianak, West Kalimantan. Located ideally on the equator and strategically located by the Karimata Strait and the South China Sea, it is in the same region as other ASEAN capitals such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bandar Seri Begawan.[24]\n* Palembang, South Sumatra. The city has historical significance as the former capital of the Srivijaya maritime empire, which symbolises the return of the archipelago's former glory. It is also strategically located near the main maritime route of the Malacca strait, near the other ASEAN capitals of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.[25]\n\n\nIf Jakarta were kept as the official capital, administrative centres would have been moved to other nearby locations. Suggested locations include: \n\n\n\n* Jonggol, West Java, located about 40 kilometres southeast of Jakarta, and proposed future capital of Indonesia since the New Order.[26]\n* Karawang, West Java, located about 60 kilometres east of Jakarta.[27]\n* Kertajati, Majalengka Regency, West Java, located about 200 kilometres east of Jakarta and 40 kilometres west of Cirebon. The proposed planned capital will be connected to the planned new West Java airport, Java railways, and the Trans-Java toll road.[28] The underused airport has been derided as a 'white elephant' during the 2019 presidential elections and policymakers are under pressure to demonstrate utility for the enormous bills related to the project.[29]\n* Maja, Lebak Regency, Banten, located about 60 kilometres west of Jakarta. Most of Maja's lands are already acquired by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency.[30]\n* Jakarta Bay, North Jakarta. In 2013, Joko Widodo, then Governor of Jakarta, proposed to move the administrative centre of Indonesia to the planned future reclaimed islands in Jakarta Bay. This plan is in line with the planned National Capital Integrated Coastal Development; the new administrative district will be located on a Garuda bird-shaped island planned to be built on Jakarta Bay.[31]\n\n\n## Move to Nusantara[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nusantara (planned city)\n\n![](image)Zero Point of new Nusantara city\nIn April 2017, the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) administration considered moving the capital from Jakarta. The government planned to finish assessing potential alternative sites for Indonesia's new capital by the end of 2017. According to an official from the Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia (Bappenas), the government was determined to move the Indonesian capital out of Java.[32] In April 2019, it was announced that Jakarta would no longer be the capital of Indonesia in the future, with a 10-year plan to transfer all government offices to a new capital city.[33] The National Development Planning Ministry recommended the three provinces of South, Central, and East Kalimantan as they all met the requirements for a new capital, including being relatively free from earthquakes and volcanoes. Shortly after the plan was announced in April 2017, Jokowi visited two alternative locations in Kalimantan, Bukit Soeharto in East Kalimantan and the Triangle Area near Palangka Raya in Central Kalimantan.[34]\n\n\nThe development of Nusantara began in 23 August 2019, Jokowi submitted Presidential Letter No. R-34/Pres/08/2019. The Letter enclosed with 2 enclosures: (1) Presidential Study Report on Capital Relocation, and (2) Request on DPR Support for Capital Relocation.[35]\n\n\nOn 26 August 2019, Jokowi announced that the new capital would be partly in the Penajam North Paser Regency and partly in the Kutai Kartanegara Regency, both in East Kalimantan.[36][37] The National Development Planning Ministry announced that the move would cost an estimated Rp466 trillion (US$32.7 billion) and that the government intended to cover 19% of the cost, the remainder coming mainly from public-private partnerships and direct investment by both state-owned enterprises and the private sector.[38] The Indonesian parliament passed the bill on 18 January 2022, with construction not expected to start until after the COVID-19 vaccination campaign completes in March 2022.[39]\n\n\nIn early September 2021, the Bill for Capital Relocation completed.[40] On 29 September 2021, Jokowi administration, through the State Secretary and Ministry of National Development Planning, submitted the presidential letter contained an omnibus bill for capital relocation to the People's Representatives Council (DPR).[41] The among many items prescribed in the bill, the bill contained the plan of formation of The Nusantara Capital City Authority (Indonesian: *Otorita Ibu Kota Negara Nusantara*), special agency responsible to the new capital and answered to the President. The new agency possessed ministry-like qualities due to the office holder is by appointment of president, but with special governing capabilities which make it somewhat similar to a provincial governor.[40][42] It also regulate on how The Capital Authority operates its funding, taxing and retribution management, and managing assets on the new capital.[43]\n\n\nOn 17 January 2022, during the Special Committee Meeting of the DPR with the Government and the Regional Representatives Council (DPD), Minister of National Development Planning, Suharso Monoarfa, said the new nation's capital would be named Nusantara.[44]\n\n\nDue to the plan being submitted in the middle of Jokowi's second and final term, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR, consist of DPR and DPD) urgently re-issued an amendment to the Constitution of Indonesia, re-establishing its ability to establish the Principles of State Policies (Indonesian: *Pokok-Pokok Haluan Negara*, PPHN) in order to provide security and sustainability for the project in the long term and thus ensuring its continuation after Jokowi leaves office.[45]\n\n\n\n### Political structure[edit]\n\n\nGeopolitically, the capital's territory are likely to be formed as a new province[46] from the districts Sepaku from Penajam North Paser Regency and Samboja from Kutai Kartanegara Regency; the city of Balikpapan would instead form a semi-exclave surrounded by the capital.[47]\n\n\n\n### Proposed design and name[edit]\n\n\nThen Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing organized a capital city design contest from 3 October to 20 December 2019. The winner, *Nagara Rimba Nusa* ('Forest Archipelago')[48] by URBAN+ was officially announced on 23 December 2019. The government will collaborate on the design of the winning team with that of the second- and third-placed teams, as well as international designers, to sharpen the final design process up to March or April 2020.[49] Designers from at least 3 countries, namely China, Japan, and the United States had offered to be involved in the design.[50] The name, which had been suggested about 3 months earlier, is aligned with the winner's main concept.[51]\n\n\nOn 17 January 2022, the name of the new capital city was revealed to be Nusantara.[52]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of national capitals\n* List of former national capitals\n* List of purpose-built national capitals\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Data\" (PDF). www.dpr.go.id.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the second international airport in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.[15][16]\n\n\nCombining both modern and traditional style architectures, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[20] Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sitesâthe Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canalâall of which are popular tourist locations.[21] Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\n\n\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.[22][23][24] Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in Asia & Oceania region and emerging countries.[25][26] Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][28] The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics,[29] and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics.[30] Beijing hosts 175 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Beijing\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters å *bÄi* for *north* and äº¬ *jÄ«ng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is äº¬, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Beijing\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. *Homo erectus* fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic *Homo sapiens* also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[34] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\n\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City, built by the Yongle Emperor during the early Ming dynasty\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground.[42] Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (WadeâGiles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\").[43] Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\n\n![](image)Overlapping layout of Beijing during the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\n\n\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[47] It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[48] The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.[49]\n\n\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area.\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers)[50] and Beijing became China's sole capital.[51] The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\n\n\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking[a] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion. \nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers.[54] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.[55]\n\n\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.[56] The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war,[12] Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[59] and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.[60] This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing.[61]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.[63] In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up.\"\n\n\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads.[64][65] According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.[66] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,[67] while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China.[68] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country.[69] Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[70] The city has also hosted major international events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Beijing\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by *Xishan* or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556Â ft).\n\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the SouthâNorth Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\n\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40Â to 60 metres (130â200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main eastâwest axis.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of the Forbidden City, viewed from the Jingshan Park\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North-South Central Axis of Beijing City\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Beijing\n\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.[72] Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wangjing SOHO\nBeijing is famous for its *siheyuans*, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called *hutongs*. The *hutongs* are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, *siheyuans* and *hutongs* are rapidly disappearing,[73] as entire city blocks of *hutongs* are replaced by high-rise buildings.[74] Residents of the *hutongs* are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the *hutongs* cannot be replaced,[75] and these properties are often government owned.[76]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing average annual temperatures from 1970 to 2019 during summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January, and February). Weather station data from NOAA. For comparison the Global Surface Temperature Anomaly rose by approximately one degree over the same time period. Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen: *Dwa*), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen: *BSk*) and humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen: *Cwa*), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[77] Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is â3.5Â Â°C (25.7Â Â°F), while in July it is 26.8Â Â°C (80.2Â Â°F). Precipitation averages around 577Â mm (23Â in) annually, with close to three-quarters of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,455 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from â27.4Â Â°C (â17.3Â Â°F) on 22 February 1966 to 41.9Â Â°C (107.4Â Â°F) on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of 42.6Â Â°C (108.7Â Â°F) was set on 15 June 1942).[78][79]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991â2020 normals, extremes 1951âpresent)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high Â°C (Â°F)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum Â°C (Â°F)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Daily mean Â°C (Â°F)\n | â2.7(27.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | â1.0(30.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum Â°C (Â°F)\n | â6.9(19.6)\n | â4.2(24.4)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | â5.0(23.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low Â°C (Â°F)\n | â22.8(â9.0)\n | â27.4(â17.3)\n | â15(5)\n | â3.2(26.2)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | â3.5(25.7)\n | â12.3(9.9)\n | â18.3(â0.9)\n | â27.4(â17.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 5.8(0.23)\n | 8.6(0.34)\n | 21.7(0.85)\n | 36.1(1.42)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 169.7(6.68)\n | 113.4(4.46)\n | 53.7(2.11)\n | 28.7(1.13)\n | 13.5(0.53)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 528(20.78)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (â¥ 0.1 mm) | 1.6\n | 2.3\n | 3.0\n | 4.7\n | 6.0\n | 10.0\n | 11.9\n | 10.5\n | 7.1\n | 5.2\n | 2.9\n | 1.6\n | 66.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 2.8\n | 2.5\n | 1.3\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.7\n | 2.8\n | 11.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 43\n | 42\n | 40\n | 43\n | 47\n | 58\n | 69\n | 71\n | 64\n | 58\n | 54\n | 46\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 188.1\n | 189.1\n | 231.1\n | 243.2\n | 265.1\n | 221.6\n | 190.5\n | 205.3\n | 206.1\n | 199.9\n | 173.4\n | 177.1\n | 2,490.5\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62\n | 62\n | 62\n | 61\n | 59\n | 50\n | 42\n | 49\n | 56\n | 59\n | 59\n | 61\n | 57\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: China Meteorological Administration[80][81] |\n| Source 2: Extremes[b] and Weather Atlas[85] |\n\n#### Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When Europeans first came into sustained contact with China, \"Pekin\" and \"Peking\" were the most popular ways of romanizing the name of Beijing.[52][53]\n2. **^** All-time record high;[79] February record high;[82] May record high;[83] June record high[84]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased.[87] Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35â60% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\",[89] partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17Â billion was spent.[90] Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations,[91] and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers),[92] reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles.[93][94] The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world.[90] Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.[95]\n\n\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.[96] Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas[97] and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry.[97] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions.[96] Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015.[98] Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making.[99] Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing.[96] Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption.[98] There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014.[100] Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016.[101] Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.[101]\n\n\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area.[102] More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue,\" short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively.[103] During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\n\n\nBeijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of the city's US embassy at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the WHO, and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was \"crazy bad\". This was later changed to \"beyond index\".[104]\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.[105] Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.[106]\n\n\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.[107]\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017[108] and further reduction by 2020.[109]:â52\n\n\n\n### Readings[edit]\n\n\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).[110] The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone levels on Twitter.[111] Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.[111]\n\n\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the mobility rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing.[112] Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.[113]\n\n\n\n#### Dust storms[edit]\n\n\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.[114] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.[115] In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000Â tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.[116]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Beijing\n\nThe municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Beijing CCP Secretary (Chinese: ä¸­å±åäº¬å¸å§ä¹¦è®°). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\n\n\nGovernment officials include the mayor (Chinese: å¸é¿) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[117]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township-level divisions of Beijing.\n\nBeijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county-level subdivisions including 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. On 1 July 2010, Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively. On 13 November 2015 Miyun and Yanqing were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Beijing** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Dongcheng**\n\n**Xicheng**\n\n**Chaoyang**\n\n**Fengtai**\n\n**Shijingshan**\n\n**Haidian**\n\n**Mentougou**\n\n**Fangshan**\n\n**Tongzhou**\n\n**Shunyi**\n\n**Changping**\n\n**Daxing**\n\n**Huairou**\n\n**Pinggu**\n\n**Miyun**\n\n**Yanqing**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area in km2[119] | Total population 2010[120] | Urban areapopulation 2010[121] | Seat\n | Postal code\n | Subdivisions[122][*full citation needed*] |\n| Subdistricts | Towns | Townships[n 1] | Residential communities | Villages |\n| 110000 | Beijing\n | 16406.16 | 19,612,368 | 16,858,692 | Dongcheng / Tongzhou | 100000 | 149 | 143 | 38 | 2538 | 3857\n |\n| 110101 | Dongcheng | 41.82 | 919,253 | Jingshan Subdistrict | 100000 | 17 |  |  | 216 |  |\n| 110102 | Xicheng | 50.33 | 1,243,315 | Jinrong Street Subdistrict | 100000 | 15 |  |  | 259 |  |\n| 110105 | Chaoyang | 454.78 | 3,545,137 | 3,532,257 | Chaowai Subdistrict | 100000 | 24 |  | 19 | 358 | 5\n |\n| 110106 | Fengtai | 305.53 | 2,112,162 | 2,098,632 | Fengtai Subdistrict | 100000 | 16 | 2 | 3 | 254 | 73\n |\n| 110107 | Shijingshan | 84.38 | 616,083 | Lugu Subdistrict | 100000 | 9 |  |  | 130 |  |\n| 110108 | Haidian | 430.77 | 3,280,670 | 3,208,563 | Haidian Subdistrict | 100000 | 22 | 7 |  | 603 | 84\n |\n| 110109 | Mentougou | 1447.85 | 290,476 | 248,547 | Dayu Subdistrict | 102300 | 4 | 9 |  | 124 | 179\n |\n| 110111 | Fangshan | 1994.73 | 944,832 | 635,282 | Gongchen Subdistrict | 102400 | 8 | 14 | 6 | 108 | 462\n |\n| 110112 | Tongzhou | 905.79 | 1,184,256 | 724,228 | Beiyuan Subdistrict | 101100 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 40 | 480\n |\n| 110113 | Shunyi | 1019.51 | 876,620 | 471,459 | Shengli Subdistrict | 101300 | 6 | 19 |  | 61 | 449\n |\n| 110114 | Changping | 1342.47 | 1,660,501 | 1,310,617 | Chengbei Subdistrict | 102200 | 8 | 14 |  | 180 | 303\n |\n| 110115 | Daxing | 1036.34 | 1,365,112 | 965,683 | Xingfeng Subdistrict | 102600 | 5 | 14 |  | 64 | 547\n |\n| 110116 | Huairou | 2122.82 | 372,887 | 253,088 | Longshan Subdistrict | 101400 | 2 | 12 | 2 | 27 | 286\n |\n| 110117 | Pinggu | 948.24 | 415,958 | 219,850 | Binhe Subdistrict | 101200 | 2 | 14 | 2 | 23 | 275\n |\n| 110118 | Miyun | 2225.92 | 467,680 | 257,449 | Gulou Subdistrict | 101500 | 2 | 17 | 1 | 57 | 338\n |\n| 110119 | Yanqing | 1994.89 | 317,426 | 154,386 | Rulin Subdistrict | 102100 | 3 | 11 | 4 | 34 | 376\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n |\n| Beijing Municipality\n | åäº¬å¸ | BÄijÄ«ng ShÃ¬\n |\n| Dongcheng District | ä¸ååº | DÅngchÃ©ng QÅ«\n |\n| Xicheng District | è¥¿ååº | XÄ«chÃ©ng QÅ«\n |\n| Chaoyang District | æé³åº | ChÃ¡oyÃ¡ng QÅ«\n |\n| Fengtai District | ä¸°å°åº | FÄngtÃ¡i QÅ«\n |\n| Shijingshan District | ç³æ¯å±±åº | ShÃ­jÇngshÄn QÅ«\n |\n| Haidian District | æµ·æ·åº | HÇidiÃ n QÅ«\n |\n| Mentougou District | é¨å¤´æ²åº | MÃ©ntÃ³ugÅu QÅ«\n |\n| Fangshan District | æ¿å±±åº | FÃ¡ngshÄn QÅ«\n |\n| Tongzhou District | éå·åº | TÅngzhÅu QÅ«\n |\n| Shunyi District | é¡ºä¹åº | ShÃ¹nyÃ¬ QÅ«\n |\n| Changping District | æå¹³åº | ChÄngpÃ­ng QÅ«\n |\n| Daxing District | å¤§å´åº | DÃ xÄ«ng QÅ«\n |\n| Huairou District | ææåº | HuÃ¡irÃ³u QÅ«\n |\n| Pinggu District | å¹³è°·åº | PÃ­nggÇ QÅ«\n |\n| Miyun District | å¯äºåº | MÃ¬yÃºn QÅ«\n |\n| Yanqing District | å»¶åºåº | YÃ¡nqÃ¬ng QÅ«\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Including Ethnic townships & other township related subdivisions.\n\n#### Towns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of township-level divisions of Beijing\n\nBeijing's 16 county-level divisions (districts) are further subdivided into 273 lower third-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24 townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.\nTowns within Beijing Municipality but outside the urban area include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n* Changping æå¹³\n* Huairou ææ\n* Miyun å¯äº\n* Liangxiang è¯ä¹¡\n* Liulimiao ççåº\n* Tongzhou éå·\n* Yizhuang äº¦åº\n* Tiantongyuan å¤©éè\n* Beiyuan åè\n* Xiaotangshan å°æ±¤å±±\n\nSeveral place names in Beijing end with *mÃ©n* (é¨), meaning \"gate\", as they were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names end in *cÅ«n* (æ), meaning \"village\", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and procuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe judicial system in Beijing consists of the Supreme People's Court, the highest court in the country, the Beijing Municipal High People's Court, the high people's court of the municipality, three intermediate people's courts, one intermediate railway transport court, 14 basic people's court (one for each of the municipality's districts and counties), and one basic railway transport court. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shijingshan oversees the basic courts of Haidian, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changping and Yanqing.[123] The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Fengtai oversees the basic courts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Fangshan and Daxing.[123] The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Laiguangying, is the newest of the three intermediate people's courts and opened on 21 August 2013.[123] It oversees the district courts of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun.[123][124] Each court in Beijing has a corresponding people's procuratorate.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing products treemap, 2020\nAs of 2022[update], Beijing's nominal GDP was CNÂ¥4.16 trillion ($619 billion in nominal, $1.016 trillion in PPP), about 3.44% of the country's GDP and ranked 13th among province-level administrative units; its nominal GDP per capita was US$28,258 (CNÂ¥190,059) and ranked the 1st in the country.[3][125] It also ranks the tenth largest in the metropolitan economies in the world.[126] Beijing's nominal GDP is projected to reach US$1.1 trillion in 2035, ranking among the world's top 10 largest cities (together with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[127] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach US$45,000 in 2030.[128]\n\n\nDue to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world.[129] As of August 2022, Beijing has 54 Fortune Global 500 companies, more than Japan (47), the third-place country after China (145) and the United States (124).[130][131] Beijing has also been described as the \"billionaire capital of the world\".[132][133] In 2020, Beijing is the fifth wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $2 trillion.[134] Beijing is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and worldwide and making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[135] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Beijing was ranked as having the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world and fourth-most competitive in the whole Asia & Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore).[136]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020â2021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical GDP of Beijing for 1978âpresent

GDP is based on mid-year population.\n\n\n\n### Sector composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Taikoo Li Sanlitun shopping arcade is a destination for locals and visitors.\nThe city has a post-industrial economy that is dominated by the tertiary sector (services), which generated 83.8% of output, followed by the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) at 15.8% and the primary sector (agriculture, mining) at 0.26%.[3] The services sector is broadly diversified with professional services, wholesale and retail, information technology, commercial real estate, scientific research, and residential real estate each contributing at least 6% to the city's economy in 2022.[3][140]\n\n\nThe single largest sub-sector remains industry, whose share of overall output has shrunk to 12.1% in 2022.[3] The mix of industrial output has changed significantly since 2010 when the city announced that 140 highly-polluting, energy and water resource intensive enterprises would be relocated from the city in five years.[141] The relocation of Capital Steel to neighboring Hebei province had begun in 2005.[142][143] In 2013, output of automobiles, aerospace products, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and food processing all increased.[140]\n\n\nIn the farmland around Beijing, vegetables and fruits have displaced grain as the primary crops under cultivation.[140] In 2013, the tonnage of vegetable, edible fungus and fruit harvested was over three times that of grain.[140] In 2013, overall acreage under cultivation shrank along with most categories of produce as more land was reforested for environmental reasons.[140]\n\n\n\n### Economic zones[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of economic and technological development zones in Beijing.\n\n![](image)The skyline of Beijing CBD\n![](image)Zhongguancun is a technology hub in Haidian District.\nIn 2006, the city government identified six high-end economic output zones around Beijing as the primary engines for local economic growth. In 2012, the six zones produced 43.3% of the city's GDP, up from 36.5% in 2007.[144][145]\nThe six zones are:\n\n\n\n1. Zhongguancun, China's silicon village in Haidian District northwest of the city, is home to both established and start-up tech companies. In the first two quarters of 2014, 9,895 companies registered in the six zones, among which 6,150 were based in Zhongguancun.[146] Zhongguancun is also the center of Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.\n2. Beijing Financial Street, in Xicheng District on the west side of the city between Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen, is lined with headquarters of large state banks and insurance companies. The country's financial regulatory agencies including the central bank, bank regulator, securities regulator, and foreign exchange authority are located in the neighborhood.\n3. Beijing Central Business District (CBD), is actually located to the east of downtown, near the embassies along the eastern Third Ring Road between Jianguomenwai and Chaoyangmenwai. The CBD is home to most of the city's skyscraper office buildings. Most of the city's foreign companies and professional service firms are based in the CBD.\n4. Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area, better known as Yizhuang, is an industrial park the straddles the southern Fifth Ring Road in Daxing District. It has attracted pharmaceutical, information technology, and materials engineering companies.[147]\n5. Beijing Airport Economic Zone was created in 1993 and surrounds the Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi District northeast of the city. In addition to logistics, airline services, and trading firms, this zone is also home to Beijing's automobile assembly plants.\n6. Beijing Olympic Center Zone surrounds the Olympic Green due north of downtown and is developing into an entertainment, sports, tourism and business convention center.\n\n\nShijingshan, on the western outskirts of the city, is a traditional heavy industrial base for steel-making.[148] Chemical plants are concentrated in the far eastern suburbs.\n\n\nLess legitimate enterprises also exist. Urban Beijing is known for being a center of infringed goods; anything from the latest designer clothing to DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Beijing\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | Â±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953 | 2,768,149 | âÂ Â Â Â  |\n| 1964 | 7,568,495 | +9.57% |\n| 1982 | 9,230,687 | +1.11% |\n| 1990 | 10,819,407 | +2.00% |\n| 2000 | 13,569,194 | +2.29% |\n| 2010 | 19,612,368 | +3.75% |\n| 2020[138] | 21,893,095 | +1.11% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2021, Beijing had a total population of 21.89 million within the municipality, of which 19.16 million (87.5 percent) resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.73 million (12.5) lived in rural villages.[3] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 24.9 million.[150][151]\n\n\nWithin China, the city ranked second in urban population after Shanghai and the third in municipal population after Shanghai and Chongqing. Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years, especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was the largest city in the world.\n\n\nAbout 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local *hukou* permits, which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.[140] The remaining 8 million residents had *hukou* permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.[140]\n\n\nThe population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.[140] The total population in 2004 was 14.213 million.[152] The population gains are driven largely by migration. The population's rate of natural increase in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a birth rate of 8.93 and a mortality rate of 4.52.[140] The gender balance was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.[140]\n\n\nWorking age people account for nearly 73.6% of the population.[3] Compared to 2004, residents age 0â14 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.95% to 9.92% in 2013, but again increased to 12.1% in 2021.[3]\nResidents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 8.58%, but increased to 14.2% in 2021.[3] From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of city residents with at least some college education nearly doubled, from 20.4% to 37.3%, and further increased to 49.1% by 2021.[3] About 66.4% have senior secondary school education and 88.2% had reached middle school.[3]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, nearly 96% of Beijing's population are ethnic Han Chinese.[153] Of the 800,000 ethnic minority population living in the capital, Manchu (336,000), Hui (249,000), Korean (77,000), Mongol (37,000) and Tujia (24,000) constitute the five largest groups.[154] In addition, there were 8,045 Hong Kong residents, 500 Macau residents, and 7,772 Taiwan residents along with 91,128 registered foreigners living in Beijing.[153] A study by the Beijing Academy of Sciences estimates that in 2010 there were on average 200,000 foreigners living in Beijing on any given day including students, business travellers and tourists that are not counted as registered residents.[155]\n\n\nIn 2017 the Chinese government implemented population controls for Beijing and Shanghai to fight what it called the \"big city disease\" which includes congestion, pollution, and shortages of education and health care services. From this policy, Beijing's population declined by 20,000 from 2016 to 2017.[156] Some low-income people are being forcibly removed from the city as both legal and illegal housing is being demolished in some high-density residential neighborhoods.[156] The population is being redistributed to Jing-Jin-Ji and Xiong'an New Area, the transfer to the latter expected to include 300,000-500,000 people working in government research, universities, and corporate headquarters.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Beijing, Education in China, and Higher education in China\n\nSee also: Rankings of universities in China, List of universities in China, and Double First Class University Plan\nBeijing is a world leading center for scientific and technological innovation and has been ranked the No.1 city in the world with the largest scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][159][28] The city is also leading the world with the highest share of articles published in the fields of physical sciences, chemistry, and earth and environmental sciences, especially in the United Nations'17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related output.[160][161][162][163]\n\n\nBeijing has over 90 public colleges and universities, which is the largest urban public university system in Asia and the first city in China with most higher education institutions,[164][165] and it is home to the two best universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the whole of Asia-Oceania region and emerging countries with its shared rankings at 16th place in the world by the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[166][167][26] Both are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[168]\n\n\nBeijing also has the highest number of universities of any city in the country, representing more than one-fifth of 147 Double First-Class Universities, a national plan to develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions by the end of 2050.[169] A number of Beijing's most prestigious universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beihang University, Beijing Institute of Technology, China Agricultural University, Minzu University of China, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, University of International Business and Economics, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Central University of Finance and Economics.[170][22][171][172] These universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[173][174]\n\n\nThe city is a seat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been consistently ranked the No.1 research institute in the world by *Nature Index* since the list's inception in 2014, by Nature Research.[175][176][177] The academy also runs the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in Beijing and ranked among the world's top five research institutions by the Nature Index.[178] Beijing is also a site of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\nSome of the national key universities in Beijing are:\n\n* Beijing Forestry University\n* Beijing Jiaotong University\n* Beijing University of Technology\n* Beijing University of Chinese Medicine\n* Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications\n* Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute\n*

outperformed all of the other 78 participating countries in all categories (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[179]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Beijing Ancient Observatory\nPeople native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. This speech is the basis for *putonghua*, the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.\n\n\nBeijing or Peking opera is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sliced Peking duck served with traditional condiments\nBeijing cuisine is the local style of cooking. Peking duck is perhaps the best known dish. Fuling jiabing, a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (*bing*) resembling a flat disk with a filling made from *fu ling*, a fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing.\n\n\nThe cloisonnÃ© (or *Jingtailan*, literally \"Blue of Jingtai\") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. CloisonnÃ© making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.[181] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include \"carved lacquer\" and \"engraved gold\".\n\n\nYounger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.[182] Today, Houhai, Sanlitun and Wudaokou are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.\n\n\nIn 2012 Beijing was named as City of Design and became part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[183]\n\n\n\n### Places of interest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Beijing) and List of Beijing landmarks\n\n\n> ...the city remains an epicenter of tradition with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewâin the famed Forbidden City and in the city's lush pavilions and gardens...\n> \n> ââNational Geographic[184]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Qianmen Avenue, a traditional commercial street outside Qianmen Gate along the southern Central Axis\n![](image)Inside the Forbidden City\nAt the historical heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;[185] the Forbidden City hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably Beihai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places, particularly Beihai Park, are described as masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,[186] and are tourist destinations of historical importance;[187] in the modern era, Zhongnanhai has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. From Tiananmen Square, right across from the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the city; the former, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[188] contains a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that served as the summer retreats for the Qing imperial family.\n\n\nAmong the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (*Tiantan*), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[189] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayers to Heaven for good harvest.

The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the Chinese giant panda.\n\n\nThere are 144 museums and galleries (as of JuneÂ 2008[update]) in the city.[190][191][192] In addition to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.[192]\n\n\nLocated at the outskirts of urban Beijing, but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[193] The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the municipality,[194] containing a wealth of discoveries, among them one of the first specimens of *Homo erectus* and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena *Pachycrocuta brevirostris*. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China,[195] most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Beijing is the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[196] Theme parks located within the city include Universal Studios Beijing and Happy Valley Beijing, both of which are among the most visited theme parks in Asia.[197]\n\n\n\n### Intangible cultural heritage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peking opera\nThe cultural heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse. Starting 2006, the Beijing government started the process of selecting and preserving cultural heritages. Five cultural heritage lists have been published over the years. 288 distinct practices are categorized as cultural heritage. These 288 cultural heritages are further divided into ten categories, namely folk music, folk dance, traditional opera, melodious art, juggling and game, folk art, traditional handicraft, traditional medicine, folk literature and folklore.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n* Folk music\n\t+ Zhihua Temple music\n\t+ Tongzhou shanty\n* Folk dance\n\t+ Tongzhou Dragon dance\n\t+ Miliangtun Stilts\n* Traditional opera\n\t+ Kunqu\n\t+ Peking opera\n* Melodious art\n\t+ Xiangsheng\n* Acrobatic Performance and game\n\t+ Weiqi(Go)\n\t+ Xiangqi\n* Folk art\n\t+ Ivory carving\n* Traditional handicraft\n\t+ Peking duck manufacturing techniques\n\t+ CloisonnÃ© manufacturing techniques\n* Traditional medicine\n\t+ Tong Ren Tang culture\n* Folk literature\n\t+ Yongding River legend[*permanent dead link*]\n* Folklore\n\t+ Miaohui\n\t+ Lantern Festival\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThe religious heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse as Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity all have significant historical presence in the city. As the national capital, the city also hosts the State Administration for Religious Affairs and various state-sponsored institutions of the leading religions.[202] In recent decades, foreign residents have brought other religions to the city.[202] According to Wang Zhiyun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2010 there were 2.2 million Buddhists in the city, equal to 11.2% of the total population.[203] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.78% of the city's population.[204] According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 1.76% of the population of Beijing.[205]\n\n\n\n### Chinese folk religion and Taoism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fire God Temple in Di'anmen\nBeijing has many temples dedicated to folk religious and communal deities, many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the God of Heaven (ç¥­å¤©; *jÃ¬tiÄn*) at the Temple of Heaven have been resumed by Confucian groups in the 2010s.\n\n\nThere are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (å¨å¨; *NiÃ¡ngniÃ¡ng*) in the city, one of them near the Olympic Village, and they revolve around a major cult center at Mount Miaofeng.

Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake, while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the tallest in the world.[206][207]\n\n\nThe national Chinese Taoist Association and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the White Cloud Temple of Quanzhen Taoism, which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times.

The Big Air Shougang ski jump is in the western suburbs and was built for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[219]\n\n\n\n### Clubs[edit]\n\n\nProfessional sports teams based in Beijing include:\n\n\n\n* China Baseball League\n\t+ Beijing Tigers\n* Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Ducks\n\t+ Beijing Royal Fighters\n* Women's Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Shougang\n* Kontinental Hockey League\n\t+ HC Kunlun Red Star\n* Chinese Super League\n\t+ Beijing Guoan\n* China League Two\n\t+ Beijing BIT\n* Chinese Women's National League\n\t+ Beijing BG Phoenix\n\nThe Beijing Olympians of the American Basketball Association, formerly a Chinese Basketball Association team, kept their name and maintained a roster of primarily Chinese players after moving to Maywood, California in 2005.\n\n\nChina Bandy Federation is based in Beijing, one of several cities in which the potential for bandy development is explored.[220]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing South railway station, one of several rail stations in the city\nBeijing is an important transport hub in North China with six ring roads, 1167Â km (725 miles) of expressways,[221] 15 National Highways, nine conventional railways, and six high-speed railways converging on the city.\n\n\n\n### Rail and high-speed rail[edit]\n\n\nBeijing serves as a large rail hub in China's railway network. Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: Shanghai (Jinghu Line), Guangzhou (Jingguang Line), Kowloon (Jingjiu Line), Harbin (Jingha Line) (including Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)), Baotou (Jingbao Line), Chengde (Jingcheng Line), Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line), Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line) and Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line). In addition, the DatongâQinhuangdao railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\n\nBeijing also has six high-speed rail lines: the BeijingâTianjin intercity railway, which opened in 2008; the BeijingâShanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011; the BeijingâGuangzhou high-speed railway, which opened in 2012; and the BeijingâXiong'an intercity railway and the BeijingâZhangjiakou intercity railway, both of which opened in 2019. The BeijingâShenyang high-speed railway was completed in 2021.\n\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the Beijing railway station, which opened in 1959; the Beijing West railway station, which opened in 1996; and the Beijing South railway station, which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The Beijing North railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The Qinghe railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The Beijing Chaoyang railway station opened in 2021; The Beijing Fengtai railway station opened in 2022; and the Beijing Sub-Center railway station is under construction.\n\n\nSmaller stations in the city including Beijing East railway station and Daxing Airport station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.[222]\n\n\nFrom Beijing, direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam and North Korea. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing\n\n![](image)View of 4th Ring Road in Chaoyang District\n![](image)Traffic jam on the BeijingâTongzhou Expressway\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the \"ring roads\" that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\n\n\n![](image)BeijingâLhasa Expressway in Changping District\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.[223] The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles.[224] By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.[225]\n\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.[226] More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\n\n\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.[227]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n#### Beijing Capital International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terminal 3 of the Beijing Capital International Airport\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20Â mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's HartsfieldâJackson International Airport.[14] Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Beijing Daxing International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Daxing International Airport\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29Â mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019.[228][229][230] The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the BeijingâXiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.\n\n\n\n#### Other airports[edit]\n\n\nWith the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located 13 kilometres (8.1Â mi) south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n\n#### Visa requirements for air passengers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 1 January 2013[update], tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers[231] with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.[232]\n\n\n\n### Public transit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Daxing line train on the Beijing Subway, which is among the longest and busiest rapid transit systems in the world\n![](image)An articulated Beijing bus\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783Â km (487Â mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of Â¥2.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650Â mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes.[233][*betterÂ sourceÂ needed*] The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\n\n\nOn 28 December 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express.[234] Under the new system a trip under 6Â km (3+1â2Â mi) will cost Â¥3.00(US$0.49), an additional Â¥1.00 will be added for the next 6Â km (3+1â2Â mi) and the next 10Â km (6Â mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32Â km (20Â mi).[234] For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional Â¥1.00 is added.[234] For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost Â¥ 8.00.\n\n\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as Â¥1.00 when purchased with the *Yikatong* metrocard.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at Â¥13 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9Â mi), Â¥2.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62Â mi) and Â¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are Â¥2.3 (Â¥4.6 during rush hours of 7â9 am and 5â7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5Â mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, CitroÃ«ns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3Â mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion *over* that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11Â pm and 5Â am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15Â km (9Â mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.[235] On 30 March 2019, a 6.5Â km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies.[236] Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.[237]\n\n\n\n## Defence and aerospace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\n\n\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\n\n\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, in Haidian District tracks the country's crewed and uncrewed flight and other space exploration initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Nature and wildlife[edit]\n\n\nBeijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7Â km2 (517.3Â sqÂ mi).[238] The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard, leopard cat, wolf, red fox, wild boar, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, hog badger, Siberian weasel, Amur hedgehog, roe deer, and mandarin rat snake.[239][240][241] The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District.[242] The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of PÃ¨re David's deer, now extinct in the wild. The Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007, is endemic to Beijing. The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat and Rickett's big-footed bat.[243]\n\n\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200â300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting.[244][245] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique.[246][247] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets.[245] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.[245][248]\n\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nBeijing is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:[254]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey\n* ![](image) Astana, Kazakhstan\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium\n* ![](image) Bucharest, Romania\n* ![](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt\n* ![](image) Canberra, Australia\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany\n* ![](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n* ![](image) Delhi, India\n* ![](image) Doha, Qatar\n* ![](image) Dublin, Ireland\n* ![](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![](image) Ãle-de-France, France\n* ![](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![](image) Jakarta, Indonesia\n* ![](image) Johannesburg, South Africa\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![](image) London, England, United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![](image) Minsk, Belarus\n* ![](image) Mexico City, Mexico\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ottawa, Canada\n* ![](image) Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n* ![](image) Riga, Latvia\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) San JosÃ©, Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Estonia](image) Tallinn, Estonia\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran\n* ![](image) Tel Aviv, Israel\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan\n* ![](image) Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n* ![](image) Vientiane, Laos\n* ![](image) Washington D.C., United States\n* ![](image) Wellington, New Zealand\n\n### Foreign embassies and consulates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: list of diplomatic missions in China\nIn 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world.[255] China hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Beijing.

New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of the Government of India, hosting the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sansad Bhavan, and the Supreme Court. New Delhi is a municipality within the NCT, administered by the NDMC, which covers mostly Lutyens' Delhi and a few adjacent areas. The municipal area is part of a larger administrative district, the New Delhi district.\n\n\nAlthough colloquially *Delhi* and *New Delhi* are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital Territory of Delhi, both are distinct entities, with both the municipality and the New Delhi district forming a relatively small part of the megacity of Delhi. The National Capital Region is a much larger entity comprising the entire NCT along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states, including Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut, YEIDA City, Gurgaon and Faridabad.\n\n\nThe foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by George V during the Delhi Durbar of 1911.[7] It was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931,[8] by Viceroy and Governor-General Irwin.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Establishment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nLord Curzon and Lady Curzon arriving at the Delhi Durbar, 1903\n![](image)\nThe Delhi Durbar of 1911, with George V and Mary seated upon the dais\n![](image)\nThe 1931 postage stamp series celebrated the inauguration of New Delhi as the seat of government. The one rupee stamp shows George V with the \"Secretariat Building\" and Dominion Columns.\n\nUntil December 1911 Calcutta was the capital of India during the British Rule. However, it had become the centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century, which led to the Partition of Bengal by Viceroy Lord Curzon. This created massive political and religious upsurge including political assassinations of British officials in Calcutta. The anti-colonial sentiments among the public led to a complete boycott of British goods, which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and immediately shift the capital to New Delhi.[9]\n\n\nOld Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire, as India was officially named, from Calcutta on the east coast, to Delhi.[10] The Government of British India felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from Delhi, which is in the centre of northern India.[10] The land for building the new city of Delhi was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act 1894.\n\n\nDuring the Delhi Durbar on 12 December 1911, George V, Emperor of India, while laying the foundation stone for the viceroy's residence in the Coronation Park, Kingsway Camp, declared that the capital of the Raj would be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.[11][12][13][14] Three days later, George V and his consort, Queen Mary, laid the foundation stone of New Delhi at Kingsway Camp.[15] Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens, who first visited Delhi in 1912, and Herbert Baker, both leading 20th-century British architects.[16] The contract was given to Sobha Singh. The original plan called for its construction in Tughlaqabad, inside the Tughlaqabad Fort, but this was given up because of the Delhi-Calcutta trunk line that passed through the fort.[*citation needed*] Construction really began after World War I and was completed by 1931. The gardening and planning of plantations was led by A.E.P. Griessen, and later William Mustoe.[17] The city that was later dubbed \"Lutyens' Delhi\" was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on 10 February 1931 by Viceroy Lord Irwin.[18] Lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain's imperial aspirations.[19][20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Secretariat Building houses Ministries of Defence, Finance, Home Affairs and External Affairs. It also houses the Prime Minister's office.\nSoon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with George Swinton as chairman, and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted reports for both north and south sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a northâsouth axis linking the Viceroy's House at one end with Paharganj at the other. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites on the north side, the committee settled on the south site.[21] A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel, which was also considered the site of Indraprastha, the ancient region of Delhi. Subsequently, the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911â1912, where the Coronation Pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat. The Rajpath, also known as King's Way, stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Secretariat building, the two blocks of which flank the Rashtrapati Bhawan and houses ministries of the government of India, and the Parliament House, both designed by Baker, are located at the Sansad Marg and run parallel to the Rajpath.\n\n\nIn the south, land up to Safdarjung's Tomb was acquired to create what is today known as Lutyens' Bungalow Zone.[22] Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of Raisina Hill, a circular railway line around the Council House (now Parliament House), called the *Imperial Delhi Railway*, was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years. The last stumbling block was the Agra-Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (India Gate) and Kingsway (Rajpath), which was a problem because the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city at that time. The line was shifted to run along the Yamuna River, and it began operating in 1924. The New Delhi Railway Station opened in 1926, with a single platform at Ajmeri Gate near Paharganj, and was completed in time for the city's inauguration in 1931.[23][24] As construction of the Viceroy's House (the present Rashtrapati Bhavan), Central Secretariat, Parliament House, and All-India War Memorial (India Gate) was winding down, the building of a shopping district and a new plaza, Connaught Place, began in 1929, and was completed by 1933. Named after Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught (1850â1942), it was designed by Robert Tor Russell, chief architect to the Public Works Department (PWD).[25]\n\n\nAfter the capital of India moved to Delhi, a temporary secretariat building was constructed in a few months in 1912 in North Delhi. Most of the government offices of the new capital moved here from the 'Old secretariat' in Old Delhi (the building now houses the Delhi Legislative Assembly), a decade before the new capital was inaugurated in 1931. Many employees were brought into the new capital from distant parts of India, including the Bengal Presidency and Madras Presidency. Subsequently, housing for them has developed around Gole Market area in the 1920s.[26] Built in the 1940s, to house government employees, with bungalows for senior officials in the nearby Lodhi Estate area, Lodhi colony near historic Lodhi Gardens, was the last residential areas built by the British Raj.[27]\n\n\n\n### Post-independence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rashtrapati Bhavan, the home of the President of India\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, limited autonomy was conferred to New Delhi and was administered by a Chief Commissioner appointed by the Government of India. In 1966, Delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant Governor. The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi.[28] A system was introduced under which the elected government was given wide powers, excluding law and order which remained with the Central Government. The actual enforcement of the legislation came in 1993.\n\n\nThe first major extension of New Delhi outside of Lutyens' Delhi came in the 1950s when the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) developed a large area of land southwest of Lutyens' Delhi to create the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri, where land was allotted for embassies, chanceries, high commissions and residences of ambassadors, around a wide central vista, *Shanti Path*.[29]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nWith a total area of 42.7Â km2 (16.5Â sqÂ mi),[1] the municipality of New Delhi forms a small part of the Delhi metropolitan area.[30] Since the city is located on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, there is little difference in elevation across the city. New Delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the Aravali Range; all that is left of those mountains is the Delhi Ridge, which is also called the Lungs of Delhi. While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the Yamuna River, it is essentially a landlocked city. East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara.\n\n\n\n### Seismology[edit]\n\n\nNew Delhi falls under the seismic zone-IV, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.[31] It lies on several fault lines and thus experiences frequent earthquakes, most of them of mild intensity. There was a spike in the number of earthquakes between 2011 and 2015, most notable being a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in 2015 with its epicentre in Nepal, a 4.7-magnitude earthquake on 25 November 2007, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake on 7 September 2011, a 5.2-magnitude earthquake on 5 March 2012, and a swarm of twelve earthquakes, including four of magnitudes 2.5, 2.8, 3.1, and 3.3, on 12 November 2013.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate of Delhi\n\nThe climate of New Delhi is a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen *Cwa*) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen *BSh*) with high variation between summer and winter in terms of both temperature and rainfall. The temperature varies from 46Â Â°C (115Â Â°F) in summers to around 0Â Â°C (32Â Â°F) in winters. The area's version of a humid subtropical climate is noticeably different from many other cities with this climate classification in that it features long and very hot summers with dust storms, relatively dry and mild winters with wildfire haze, and a monsoonal period. Summers are long, extending from early April to October, with the monsoon season occurring in the middle of the summer. Winter starts in November and peaks in January. The annual mean temperature is around 25Â Â°C (77Â Â°F); monthly daily mean temperatures range from approximately 13 to 34Â Â°C (55 to 93Â Â°F). New Delhi's highest temperature ever recorded is 49.2Â Â°C (120.6Â Â°F) on 15 May 2022 at Met Delhi Mungeshpur while the lowest temperature ever recorded is â2.2Â Â°C (28.0Â Â°F) on 11 January 1967 at Indira Gandhi International Airport (formerly known as Palam Airport).[32] The average annual rainfall is 774.4 millimetres (30.49Â in) & monsoon rainfall from June to September is about 640.4 millimetres (25.21Â in), most of which is during the monsoons in July and August.[33]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for New Delhi (Safdarjung) 1991â2020, extremes 1901âpresent\n |\n| ---

also: Environmental issues in Delhi and Air pollution in Delhi\n\nIn Mercer's 2015 annual quality-of-living survey, New Delhi ranks at number 154 out of 230 cities due to bad air quality and pollution.[71][72] The World Health Organization ranked New Delhi as the world's worst polluted city in 2014 among about 1,600 cities the organisation tracked around the world.[73][74][75][76] In 2016, United States Environmental Protection Agency listed New Delhi as the most polluted city on Earth[77][78] and IQAir listed New Delhi as the world's most polluted capital city for the second straight year in year 2019.[79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dense smog at Connaught Place, New Delhi\nIn an attempt to lessen air pollution in New Delhi, which gets worse during the winter, a temporary alternate-day travel scheme for cars using the odd- and even-numbered licence plates system was announced by Delhi government in December 2015. In addition, trucks were to be allowed to enter India's capital only after 11Â pm, two hours later than the existing restriction.[76] The driving restriction scheme was planned to be implemented as a trial from 1 January 2016 for an initial period of 15 days. The restriction was in force between 8Â am and 8Â pm, and traffic was not restricted on Sundays.[80] Public transportation service was increased during the restriction period.[76]\n\n\nOn 16 December 2015, the Supreme Court of India mandated several restrictions on Delhi's transportation system to curb pollution. Among the measures, the court ordered to stop registrations of diesel cars and sport utility vehicles with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc and over until 31 March 2016. The court also ordered all taxis in the Delhi region to switch to compressed natural gas by 1 March 2016. Transportation vehicles that are more than 10 years old were banned from entering the capital.[81]\n\n\nAnalysing real-time vehicle speed data from Uber Delhi revealed that during the odd-even program, average speeds went up by a statistically significant 5.4 per cent (2.8 standard deviation from normal). This means vehicles have lesser idling time in traffic and vehicle engines would run closer to minimum fuel consumption.[82] In bordering areas, PM 2.5 levels were recorded more than 400 (ug/m3) while in inner areas in Delhi, they were recorded between 150 and 210 on an average.[83] However, the subcity of Dwarka, located in the southwest district, has a substantially low level of air pollution. At the NSIT University campus, located in sector 3 Dwarka, pollution levels were as low as 93 PPM.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 7 November 2017, the Indian Medical Association declared a public health emergency due to high pollution levels.[84] The highest being in the Punjabi Bagh district with an air quality index of 999 and in the RK Puram district with an index of 852. The lowest index recorded was in the Anand Vihar district with an index of 319.[85] Levels of PM2.5 were recorded at 710Â Î¼g/m3, more than 11 times the World Health Organization's safe limit.[84]\n\n\nIn a 2018 study, New Delhi was found to be the most polluted capital out of 61 capital cities around the world.[86]\n\n\nIn December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis, launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in New Delhi, among other Indian cities.[87]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India, The water quality of the Yamuna and Ganges river basins have improved as industries are closed due to the lockdown.[88][89][90][91] The air quality has also significantly improved during the lockdown.[92]\n\n\nOn 5 November 2020, New Delhi recorded its most toxic day in a year, as the concentration of poisonous PM2.5 particles was recorded at 14 times the WHO's safe limit.[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)2015 Air pollution in New Delhi (PM2.5 AQI) Hazardous\n Very Unhealthy\n Unhealthy\nUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups\n Moderate\n Good\n\n\n\n| Month\n | January\n | February\n | March\n | April\n | May\n | June\n | July\n | August\n | September\n | October\n | November\n | December\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Average Air quality index | 201-300\n(Poor)\n | 201-300\n(Poor)\n | 101-200\n(Moderate)\n | 101-200\n(Moderate)\n | 101-200\n(Moderate)\n | 101-200\n(Moderate)\n | 51-100\n(Satisfactory)\n | 51-100\n(Satisfactory)\n | 51-100\n(Satisfactory)\n | 401-500\n(Severe)\n | 401-500\n(Severe)\n | 301-400\n(Very Poor)\n |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2011, the New Delhi Municipal Council area has a population of 249,998.[3] Hindi is the most widely spoken language in New Delhi and the lingua franca of the city. English is primarily used as the formal language by business and government institutes.[94] New Delhi has a literacy rate of 89.38% according to 2011 census, which is the highest in Delhi.[95]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in New Delhi (NDMC)[96] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Hinduism |  | 89.82% |\n| Islam |  | 4.50% |\n| Christianity |  | 2.93% |\n| Sikhism |  | 1.97% |\n| Jainism |  | 0.42% |\n| Others |  | 0.36% |\n\nAccording to 2011 census, Hinduism is the religion of 89.8% of New Delhi's population.[96] There are also communities of Muslims (4.5%), Christians (2.9%), Sikhs (2.0%), Jains (0.4%).[96] Other religious groups include Parsis, Buddhists, and Jews.[97]\n\n\n\n\n* Religious buildings in New Delhi\n* ![Sacred Heart Cathedral, designed by Henry Medd based on Italian architecture](image)\n\nSacred Heart Cathedral, designed by Henry Medd based on Italian architecture\n* ![Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, a Sikh Gurdwara](image)\n\nGurudwara Bangla Sahib,  \na Sikh Gurdwara\n* ![Laxminarayan Temple, a Hindu Mandir](image)\n\nLaxminarayan Temple,  \na Hindu Mandir\n* ![Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque inside Old Fort, a mosque](image)\n\nQila-i-Kuhna Mosque inside Old Fort,   \na mosque\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: New Delhi Municipal Council; Government of Delhi; and Department of Police, Delhi\n\nThe national capital of India, New Delhi is jointly administered by both the Central Government of India and the local Government of Delhi, it is also the capital of the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Delhi\n![](image)The district of New Delhi within the NCT\nNew Delhi is administered through a municipal government, known as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). The other urban areas of the metropolis of Delhi are administered by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Delhi Cantonment Board. As of 2015[update], the government structure of the New Delhi Municipal Council includes a chairperson, three members of New Delhi's Legislative Assembly, two members nominated by the Chief Minister of the NCT of Delhi and five members nominated by the central government.\n\n\nThe districts of the NCT were redrawn in 2012 and include a district called New Delhi, albeit with different borders than the municipality. The New Delhi district includes not only the area of the municipality of the same name, but also encompasses the Delhi Cantonment and parts of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi area.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LIC,New Delhi in Connaught Place\nSee also: Companies in New Delhi\n\nNew Delhi is the largest commercial city in northern India. It has an estimated net State Domestic Product (FY 2010) of â¹1,595 billion (US$19Â billion) in nominal terms and ~â¹6,800 billion (US$81Â billion) in PPP terms.[98] As of 2013[update], the per capita income of Delhi was Rs. 230000, second highest in India after Goa. GSDP in Delhi at the prices for 2012â13 is estimated at Rs 3.88Â trillion (short scale) against Rs 3.11Â trillion (short scale) in 2011â12.[99]\n\n\nConnaught Place, one of North India's largest commercial and financial centres, is located in the northern part of New Delhi. Adjoining areas such as Barakhamba Road, ITO are also major commercial centres. Government and quasi-government sector was the primary employer in New Delhi. The city's service sector has expanded due in part to the large skilled English-speaking workforce that has attracted many multinational companies. Key service industries include information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media, and tourism.\n\n\n\n![A view of a road at Connaught Place showing busy traffic](image)Connaught Place in Delhi is an important economic hub of the National Capital Region.\n\nThe 2011 World Wealth Report ranks economic activity in New Delhi at 39, but overall the capital is ranked at 37, above cities like Jakarta and Johannesburg.[100] New Delhi with Beijing shares the top position as the most targeted emerging markets retail destination among Asia-Pacific markets.[101]\n\n\nThe government of National Capital Territory of Delhi does not release any economic figures specifically for New Delhi but publishes an official economic report on the whole of Delhi annually. According to the *Economic Survey of Delhi*, the metropolis has a net State Domestic Product (SDP) of Rs. 830.85Â billion (for the year 2004â05)[102] and a per capita income of Rs. 53,976 ($1,200).[102] In the year 2008â09 New Delhi had a per capita Income of Rs. 116,886 ($2,595). It grew by 16.2% to reach Rs. 135,814 ($3,018) in 2009â10 fiscal. New Delhi's per capita GDP (at PPP) was at $6,860 during 2009â10 fiscal, making it one of the richest cities in India. The tertiary sector contributes 78.4% of Delhi's gross SDP followed by secondary and primary sectors with 20.2% and 1.4% contribution respectively.[102]\n\n\nThe gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Delhi at prices for the year 2011â12 has been estimated at Rs 3.13Â trillion (short scale), which is an increase of 18.7 per cent over the previous fiscal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nNew Delhi is a cosmopolitan city due to the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural presence of the vast Indian bureaucracy and political system. The city's capital status has amplified the importance of national events and holidays. National events such as Republic Day, Independence Day and *Gandhi Jayanti* (Gandhi's birthday) are celebrated with great enthusiasm in New Delhi and the rest of India. On India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation from the Red Fort. Most Delhiites celebrate the day by flying kites, which are considered a symbol of freedom.[104] The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military might.[105][106]\n\n\nReligious festivals include Diwali (the festival of light), Maha Shivaratri, Teej, Durga Puja, Mahavir Jayanti, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Holi, Lohri, Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Easter, Raksha Bandhan, and Christmas.[106] The Qutub Festival is a cultural event during which performances of musicians and dancers from all over India are showcased at night, with the Qutub Minar as the chosen backdrop of the event.[107] Other events such as Kite Flying Festival, International Mango Festival and *Vasant Panchami* (the Spring Festival) are held every year in Delhi.\n\n\nIn 2007, the Japanese Buddhist organisation Nipponzan Myohoji decided to build a Peace Pagoda in the city containing Buddha relics. It was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama.\n\n\n\n### Historic sites, museums and gardens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum in New Delhi is one of the largest museums in India.\nNew Delhi is home to several historic sites and museums. The National Museum, which began with an exhibition of Indian art and artefacts at the Royal Academy in London in the winter of 1947â48,[108] was later at the end was shown at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in 1949. Later it was to form a permanent National Museum. On 15 August 1949, the National Museum was formally inaugurated and has 200,000 works of art, both of Indian and foreign origin, covering over 5,000 years.[109]\n\n\nThe India Gate, which was built in 1931, was inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.[110] It is the national monument of India commemorating the 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who died while fighting for the British Raj in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.[110] The monument is barricaded now with entry to inside arch restricted.\n\n\nThe Rajpath, which was built similar to the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in Paris, is the ceremonial boulevard for the Republic of India, located in New Delhi. The annual Republic Day parade takes place here on 26 January. The Beating retreat takes place here two days later.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rajghat, the final resting place of Mahatma Gandhi\nGandhi Smriti in New Delhi is the location where Mahatma Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life and was assassinated on 30 January 1948. Rajghat is the place where Mahatma Gandhi was cremated on 31 January 1948 after his assassination and his ashes were buried and make it a final resting place beside the sanctity of the Yamuna River. The Raj Ghat in the shape of large square platform with black marble was designed by architect Vanu Bhuta.\n\n\nJantar Mantar located in Connaught Place was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur. It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets.\n\n\nNew Delhi is home to Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum, National Gallery of Modern Art, National Museum of Natural History, National Rail Museum, National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, National Philatelic Museum, Nehru Planetarium, Shankar's International Dolls Museum.[111] and Supreme Court of India Museum,[112]\n\n\nIn the coming years, a new National War Memorial and Museum will be constructed in New Delhi[113][114] for â¹4,000 million (US$48Â million).[115][116]\n\n\nNew Delhi is particularly renowned for its beautifully landscaped gardens that can look quite stunning in spring. The largest of these include Buddha Jayanti Park and the historic Lodi Gardens. In addition, there are the gardens in the Presidential Estate, the gardens along the Rajpath and India Gate, the gardens along Shanti Path, the Rose Garden, Nehru Park and the Railway Garden in Chanakya Puri. Also of note is the garden adjacent to the Jangpura Metro Station near the Defence Colony Flyover, as are the roundabout and neighbourhood gardens throughout the city.\n\n\nThe New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area was declared the cleanest in North India, based on solid waste management, access to sanitation and other parameters of cleanliness, under the zone-wise Swachh Survekshan 2017.[117]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official residence of the President of India.\nMuch of New Delhi, planned by the leading 20th-century British architect Edwin Lutyens, was laid out to be the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain's imperial ambitions. New Delhi is structured around two central promenades called the Rajpath and the Janpath. The Rajpath, or King's Way, stretches from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate. The Janpath (Hindi: \"Path of the People\"), formerly Queen's Way, begins at Connaught Circus and cuts the Rajpath at right angles. 19 foreign embassies are located on the nearby Shantipath (Hindi: \"Path of Peace\"), making it the largest diplomatic enclave in India.[118]\n\n\nAt the heart of the city is the magnificent Rashtrapati Bhavan (formerly known as Viceroy's House) which sits atop Raisina Hill. The Secretariat, which houses ministries of the government of India, flanks out of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Parliament House, designed by Herbert Baker, is located at the Sansad Marg, which runs parallel to the Rajpath. Connaught Place is a large, circular commercial area in New Delhi, modelled after the Royal Crescent in England. Twelve separate roads lead out of the outer ring of Connaught Place, one of them being the Janpath.\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nThe New Delhi town plan, like its architecture, was chosen with one single chief consideration: to be a symbol of British power and supremacy.[20][119][120] All other decisions were subordinate to this, and it was this framework that dictated the choice and application of symbology and influences from both Hindu and Islamic architecture.[110][119]\n\n\nIt took about 20 years to build the city from 1911.[121] Many elements of New Delhi architecture borrow from indigenous sources; however, they fit into a British Classical/Palladian tradition. The fact that there were any indigenous features in the design were due to the persistence and urging of both the Viceroy Lord Hardinge and historians like E.B. Havell.[110]\n\n\nIn the year 2019, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and Government of India introduced the Central Vista redevelopment project proposing the redevelopment of over 440 Hectares,[122] costing â¹20,000 crore (equivalent to â¹240Â billion or US$2.8Â billion in 2023)[123]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Delhi\n\n![A green coloured Delhi Transport Corporation CNG bus in the middle of the road](image)\nThe New Delhi Outer Ring Road\n![](image)\nIndira Gandhi International Airport\n![Front view of a Delhi Metro Train](image)\nThe Delhi Metro\n![A view of Delhi Faridabad Skyway](image)\nA view of Delhi Faridabad Skyway\n![The Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway](image)\nThe Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, connecting Delhi to the Indira Gandhi International Airport\n![A Delhi underground metro station](image)\nThe Delhi Noida Direct Flyway (DND Flyway)\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the southwest of Delhi, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2012â13, the airport was used by more than 35Â million passengers,[125][126] making it one of the busiest airports in South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost â¹96.8 billion (US$1.2Â billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional 37Â million passengers annually.[127]\n\n\nThe Delhi Flying Club, established in 1928 with two de Havilland Moth aircraft named *Delhi* and *Roshanara*, was based at *Safdarjung Airport* which started operations in 1929, when it was the Delhi's only airport and the second in India.[128] The airport functioned until 2001; however, in January 2002 the government closed the airport for flying activities because of security concerns following the New York attacks in September 2001. Since then, the club only carries out aircraft maintenance courses,[128] and is used for helicopter rides to Indira Gandhi International Airport for VIP including the president and the prime minister.[129]\n\n\nIn 2010, Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) was conferred the fourth best airport award in the world in the 15â25Â million category, and *Best Improved Airport* in the Asia-Pacific Region by Airports Council International.[130] The airport was rated as the *Best airport in the world* in the 25â40Â million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International.[131] Delhi Airport also bags two awards for *The Best Airport in Central Asia/India* and *Best Airport Staff in Central Asia/India* at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[132]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nNew Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. Buses are operated by the state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), which owns the largest fleet of compressed natural gas (CNG)-fueled buses in the world and Delhi Transit. Personal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on New Delhi roads. New Delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India. Taxis and Auto Rickshaws also ply on New Delhi roads in large numbers. New Delhi has one of the highest road density in India and average vehicle speed is around 15â20Â km/h (9.3â12.4Â mph) in peak hours in the city.[133]\n\n\nSome roads and expressways serve as important pillars of New Delhi's road infrastructure:\n\n\n\n* Inner Ring Road is one of the most important \"state highways\" in New Delhi. It is a 51Â km long circular road, which connects important areas in New Delhi. Owing to more than 2 dozen grade-separators/flyovers, the road is almost signal-free.\n* Outer Ring Road is another major artery in New Delhi that links far-flung areas of Delhi.\n* The Delhi Noida Direct Flyway (DND Flyway) is an eight-laned access controlled tolled expressway which connects New Delhi and Delhi to Noida (an important satellite city of Uttar Pradesh). The acronym DND stands for \"Delhi-Noida Direct\".\n* 'The Delhi Gurgaon Expressway is a 28Â km (17Â mi) expressway connecting New Delhi to Gurgaon, an important satellite city of Haryana.\n* The Delhi Faridabad Skyway is controlled tolled expressway which connects New Delhi to Faridabad, an important satellite city of Haryana.\n\n\n**National Highways passing through New Delhi**\n\n\nNew Delhi is connected by road to the rest of India through National highways:\n\n\n\n* National Highway 19 (India) (old number: NH 2), commonly referred as Delhi-Kolkata Road is a busy Indian National Highway that runs through the states of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal.\n* National Highway 44 (India) is a National Highway that connects Srinagar with Kanyakumari and passes through Delhi.\n* National Highway 48 (India) is a National Highway that connects New Delhi with Chennai.\n* National Highway 9 (India) is a National Highway that connects Malout in Punjab to Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand and passes through Delhi.\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Station Name\n | Station Code\n | Railway Zone\n | Total Platforms\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New Delhi | NDLS\n | Northern Railway | 16\n |\n| Delhi Junction | DLI\n | Northern Railway | 16\n |\n| Hazrat Nizamuddin | NZM\n | Northern Railway | 9\n |\n| Anand Vihar Terminal | ANVT\n | Northern Railway | 7\n |\n| Delhi Sarai Rohilla | DEE\n | Northern Railway | 7\n |\n\n\nNew Delhi is a major junction in the Indian railway network and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway. The five main railway stations are New Delhi railway station,Delhi Junction,Nizamuddin Railway Station, Anand Vihar Railway Terminal and Sarai Rohilla.[134] The Delhi Ring Railway, a 35-kilometre circular railway network in Delhi that runs parallel to the Ring Road, is a part of Delhi's suburban railway services.[135]\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Delhi Metro\n\n![](image)Delhi Metro â Phase 2\nThe Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. Delhi Metro is the world's 12th largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro was India's first modern public transportation system, which had revolutionised travel by providing a fast, reliable, safe, and comfortable means of transport. Presently, the network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[136] serving 255 stations[a] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31Â mi).[b] The network has now crossed the boundaries of Delhi to reach Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, and Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana. All stations have escalators, elevators, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. It has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi-ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi-ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. According to a study, Delhi Metro has helped in removing about 390,000 vehicles from the streets of Delhi.[139]\n\n\nDelhi Metro is being built and operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the organisation is under administrative control of Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Besides construction and operation of Delhi metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by Padma Vibhushan E. Sreedharan, the managing director of DMRC and popularly known as the \"Metro Man\" of India. He famously resigned[140] from DMRC, taking moral responsibility for a metro bridge collapse[141] which took five lives. Sreedharan was awarded with the Legion of Honour by the French government for his contribution to Delhi Metro.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Delhi\n\n### Schools[edit]\n\n\n* DAV Public School (at multiple areas)\n* Delhi Public School (at multiple areas)\n* Guru Amar Dass Public School\n* St. Mark's Senior Secondary Public School\n* St. Xavier's School (at multiple areas)\n* The British School\n* Union Academy Senior Secondary School\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n* Delhi College of Arts and Commerce\n* Hindu College, Delhi\n* Indian Institute of Mass Communication\n* Indian Statistical Institute\n* Institute of Information Technology and Management (IITM) (at multiple areas)\n* Management Education & Research Institute (MERI)\n* Pannalal Girdharlal Dayanand Anglo Vedic College (PGDAV College)\n* Ramanujan College\n* Shaheed Bhagat Singh College\n\n\n### Universities[edit]\n\n\n* All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi\n* Association of Indian Universities\n* Delhi School of Economics\n* Delhi School of Management\n* Delhi School of Music\n* Indian Agricultural Research Institute\n* Indian Institute of Foreign Trade\n* Indian Institute of Technology Delhi\n* Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women\n* Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU)\n* Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology\n* Jamia Hamdard University\n* Jamia Millia Islamia University\n* Jawaharlal Nehru University\n* National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA)\n* National Institute of Technology Delhi\n* National Law University\n* Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri National Sanskrit University\n* South Asian University\n* TERI School of Advanced Studies\n* University of Delhi\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.

Washington, D.C. was named for George Washington, a Founding Father, victorious commanding general of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States who is widely considered the \"Father of his country\".[11][12] The district is named for Columbia, the female personification of the nation.\n\n\nWashington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the Northeast megalopolis, one of the nation's largest and most influential cultural, political, and economic regions that also includes some of the nation's largest and most prominent cities, including Baltimore, Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. As the seat of the U.S. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital.[13] The city had 20.7 million domestic visitors[14] and 1.2 million international visitors, ranking 7th in the U.S., in 2022.[15]\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. As such, Washington, D.C. is not part of any state, nor is it one itself. The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and Congress held its first session there in 1800. In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria, was officially recognized as the federal district; the city initially comprised only a portion of its modern territory, as a distinct entity within the larger federal district.[16] In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district, though locally elected government lasted only three years and did not return for over a century.[17] There have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s; a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the U.S. Senate.[18]\n\n\nDesigned in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the city is divided into quadrants, which are centered around the Capitol and include 131 neighborhoods. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545,[3] making it the 23rd-most populous city in the U.S., third-most populous city in the Southeast after Jacksonville and Charlotte, and third-most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic after New York City and Philadelphia.[19] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than oneÂ million during the workweek.[20] The Washington metropolitan area, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, is the country's sixth-largest metropolitan area with a 2020 population of 6.3Â million residents.[21]\n\n\nThe city hosts all three branches of the U.S. federal government, Congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the Supreme Court (judicial), and the governmental buildings that house most of the federal government, including the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court Building, and multiple federal departments and agencies. The city is home to many national monuments and museums, located primarily on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, and other international organizations. Many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks are based in the city, including AARP, American Red Cross, Atlantic Council, Brookings Institution, National Geographic Society, The Heritage Foundation, Wilson Center, and others.\n\n\nA locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though Congress is empowered to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C. residents are, on a federal level, politically disenfranchised since the city's residents do not have voting representation in Congress, although the city's residents elect a single at-large congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives who has no voting authority. The city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Washington, D.C.\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Washington, D.C.\n\nVarious tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people, also known as the Conoy, inhabited the lands around the Potomac River and present-day Washington, D.C. when Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. The Nacotchtank, also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries, maintained settlements around the Anacostia River in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes ultimately forced the Piscataway people to relocate, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland.[22]\n\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Built in 1765, Old Stone House in Georgetown is the city's oldest still standing building.\n![](image)James Hoban's 1793 plans for what today is the White House\n![](image)In 1800, following relocation of the nation's capital from Philadelphia, the U.S. Congress began assembling in the newly constructed United States Capitol.\nPrior to the establishment of the city as the nation's capital in 1800, the nation's capital was Philadelphia, which served as the capital on five separate occasions during the American Revolution and its aftermath from May 1775 to July 1776, December 1776 to February 1777, March 1777 to September 1777, July 1778, July 1778 to March 1781, and March 1781 to June 1783. The Continental Congress was briefly based in five additional locations: York, Pennsylvania in September 1777, Princeton, New Jersey in 1783, Annapolis, Maryland from November 1783 to August 1784, Trenton, New Jersey from November to December 1784, and New York City from January 1785 to March 1789.\n\n\nOn October 6, 1783, after the capital was forced by the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey, Congress resolved to consider a new location for it.[23] The following day, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts moved \"that buildings for the use of Congress be erected on the banks of the Delaware near Trenton, or of the Potomac, near Georgetown, provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid, for a federal town\".[24]\n\n\nIn Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.[25] The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.[26]\n\n\nArticle One, Section Eight of the U.S. Constitution permits the establishment of a \"District (not exceeding tenÂ milesÂ square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States\".[27] However, the constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In the Compromise of 1790, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States.[28][a]\n\n\nOn July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. Under the Residence Act, the exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16, 1790. Formed from land donated by Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16Â km) on each side and totaling 100 square miles (259Â km2).[29][b]\n\n\nTwo pre existing settlements were included in the territory, the port of Georgetown, founded in 1751,[30] and the port city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749.[31] In 1791 and 1792, a team led by Andrew Ellicott, including Ellicott's brothers Joseph and Benjamin and African American astronomer Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point; many of these stones are still standing.[32][33]\n\n\nA new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac River, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The same day, the federal district was named Columbia, a feminine form of Columbus, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly used at that time.[34][35] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.[36][37]\n\n\nCongress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. The area within the district was organized into two counties, the County of Washington to the east and north of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west and south.[38] After the Act's passage, citizens in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which ended their representation in Congress.[39]\n\n\n\n### Burning during War of 1812[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Burning of Washington\n\n![](image)The August 24, 1814, burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812, depicted in an 1816 portrait\n![](image)*City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard*, an 1833 portrait of Washington, D.C. by George Cooke featuring the Anacostia River (foreground), the Potomac River (left), and Capitol Hill (center-right)\nOn August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812, British forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an American force at Bladensburg. In retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in the Canadas, the British set fire to multiple government buildings in the city, including the United States Capitol, the Treasury Building and the White House. All the buildings set on fire were gutted in what became known as the burning of Washington. However, a storm forced the British to evacuate the city after just 24 hours.[40] Most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.[41]\n\n\n\n### Retrocession and the Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: District of Columbia retrocession and Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)The U.S. Capitol dome was under construction during Lincoln's first inauguration on March 4, 1861; five weeks later, the American Civil War was launched following the Confederate bombardment and fall of Fort Sumter on April 13, 1861.\nIn the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria declined economically due in part to neglect of it by Congress.[42] Alexandria was a major market in the domestic slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district, further depressing the local economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession.[43]\n\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846, to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress went further, agreeing to return all territory that Virginia had ceded to the district during its formation. This left the district's area consisting only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.[42] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.[44]\n\n\nThe outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the city's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.[45] President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district, freeing about 3,100 slaves in the district nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.[46] In 1868, Congress granted the district's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.[45]\n\n\n\n### Growth and redevelopment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: City Beautiful movement\n\n![](image)The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, built between 1871 and 1888, was the world's largest office building from its opening until 1943, when it was surpassed by The Pentagon.\nBy 1870, the district's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents.[47] Despite the city's growth, however, Washington still had dirt roads and the city lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider the proposal.[48]\n\n\nCongress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, abolished Washington County, and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia[49] and making \"the city of Washington...legally indistinguishable from the District of Columbia.\"[16]\n\n\nAfter the reorganization, in 1873, President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd as Governor of the District of Columbia. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized the city but ultimately bankrupted the district government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.[50]\n\n\nIn 1888, the city's first motorized streetcars began service. Their introduction generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries, leading to an expansion of the district over the next few decades.[51] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged to those of the City of Washington in 1895.[52] However, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works, leading it to become the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the City Beautiful movement in the early 20th century.[53]\n\n\nThe City Beautiful movement built heavily upon the already-implemented L'Enfant Plan, with the new McMillan Plan leading urban development in the city throughout the movement. Much of the old Victorian Mall was replaced with modern Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts architecture; these designs are still prevalent in the city's governmental buildings today.\n\n\nIncreased federal spending as a result of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district,[54] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations Ross A. Collins from Mississippi justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents, saying that \"my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers.\"[55]\n\n\nWorld War II led to an expansion of federal employees in the city;[56] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.[47]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights and home rule era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1968 Washington, D.C., riots and District of Columbia home rule\n\n![](image)The March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on August 28, 1963\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still not affording the city's residents representation in Congress.[57]\n\n\nAfter the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, riots broke out in the city, primarily in the UÂ Street, 14thÂ Street, 7thÂ Street, and HÂ Street corridors, which were predominantly black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and Washington, D.C. Army National Guardsmen stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned, and rebuilding from the riots was not completed until the late 1990s.[58]\n\n\nIn 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district.[59] In 1975, Walter Washington became the district's first elected and first black mayor.[60]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the D.C. statehood movement has grown in prominence. In 2016, a referendum on D.C. statehood resulted in an 85% support among Washington, D.C. voters for it to become the nation's 51st state. In March 2017, the city's congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill for statehood. Reintroduced in 2019 and 2021 as the Washington, D.C., Admission Act, the U.S. House of Representatives passed it in April 2021. After not progressing in the Senate, the statehood bill was introduced again in January 2023.[61]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Washington Monument viewed from the Tidal Basin during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in April 2018\nWashington, D.C., is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. East Coast. The city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177Â km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1Â km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9Â km2) (10.67%) is water.[62] The district is bordered by Montgomery County, Maryland, to the northwest; Prince George's County, Maryland, to the east; Arlington County, Virginia, to the west; and Alexandria, Virginia, to the south. Washington is 38 miles (61Â km) from Baltimore, 124 miles (200Â km) from Philadelphia, 227 miles (365Â km) from New York City, 242 miles (389Â km) from Pittsburgh, 384 miles (618Â km) from Charlotte, and 439 miles (707Â km) from Boston.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe south bank of the Potomac River forms the district's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries, the Anacostia River and Rock Creek.[63] Tiber Creek, a natural watercourse that once passed through the National Mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.[64] The creek also formed a portion of the now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s.[65] The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of the city at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.[66]\n\n\nThe highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125Â m) above sea level at Fort Reno Park in upper northwest Washington, D.C.[67] The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River.[68] The geographic center of Washington is near the intersection of 4th and L Streets NW.[69][70][71]\n\n\nThe district has 7,464 acres (30.21Â km2) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density U.S. cities after Philadelphia.[72] The city's sizable parkland was a factor in the city being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the park systems of the nation's 100 most populous cities, according to Trust for Public Land, a non-profit organization.[73]\n\n\nThe National Park Service manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92Â km2) of city land owned by the U.S. government.[74] Rock Creek Park is a 1,754-acre (7.10Â km2) urban forest in Northwest Washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0Â km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. Established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes.[75] Other National Park Service properties include the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, the National Mall and Memorial Parks, Theodore Roosevelt Island, Columbia Island, Fort Dupont Park, Meridian Hill Park, Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, and Anacostia Park.[76] The District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6Â km2) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers.[77] The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates the 446-acre (1.80Â km2) United States National Arboretum in Northeast Washington, D.C.[78]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate change in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Key Bridge (background) and an iced-over Potomac River (foreground) in February 2004\nWashington's climate is humid subtropical (KÃ¶ppen: *Cfa*), or oceanic (Trewartha: *Do* bordering *Cf* downtown).[79][80] Winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.[81][82]\n\n\nSummers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8Â Â°F (26.6Â Â°C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) at the height of summer.[83] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.[84]\n\n\nBlizzards affect Washington once every four to six years on average. The most violent storms, known as nor'easters, often impact large regions of the East Coast.[85] From January 27 to 28, 1922, the city officially received 28 inches (71Â cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.[86] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91Â cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.[87]\n\n\nHurricanes or their remnants occasionally impact the area in late summer and early fall. However, they usually are weak by the time they reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location.[88] Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the Georgetown neighborhood of the city.[89] Precipitation occurs throughout the year.[90]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was 106Â Â°F (41Â Â°C) on August 6, 1918, and on July 20, 1930.[91] The lowest recorded temperature was â15Â Â°F (â26Â Â°C) on February 11, 1899, right before the Great Blizzard of 1899.[85] During a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90Â Â°F (32Â Â°C) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32Â Â°F or 0Â Â°C).[92] On average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is November 18 and the last day is March 27.[93][94]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Washington, D.C.

In 1791, President George Washington commissioned Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital, and enlisted Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan.[99] The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.[100] L'Enfant based his design on plans of other major world cities, including Paris, Amsterdam, Karlsruhe, and Milan that Thomas Jefferson had sent to him.[101]:â22 L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile (1.6Â km) in length and 400 feet (120Â m) wide in area that is now the National Mall.[102] In March 1792, however, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. Andrew Ellicott, who worked with L'Enfant in surveying the city, was then tasked with completing its design. Though Ellicott revised the original L'Enfant plans, including changing some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the city's overall design.[103]\n\n\nBy the early 20th century, however, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital was marred by slums and randomly placed buildings in the city, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.[53] What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included relandscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design for the city.[100]\n\n\nBy law, the city's skyline is low and sprawling. The federal Height of Buildings Act of 1910 prohibits buildings exceeding the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet (6.1Â m).[104] Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or the 555-foot (169Â m) Washington Monument,[71] which remains the district's tallest structure. City leaders have criticised the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused partly by suburban sprawl.[104] Washington D.C. still has a relatively high homelessness rate, despite its high living standard compared to many American cities.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C. is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol.[105] All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with eastâwest streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), northâsouth streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.[105]\n\n* Selection of neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.\n* ![Bloomingdale](image)\n\nBloomingdale\n* ![Capitol Hill](image)\n\nCapitol Hill\n* ![Cathedral Heights](image)\n\nCathedral Heights\n* ![Chinatown](image)\n\nChinatown\n* ![Columbia Heights](image)\n\nColumbia Heights\n* ![Dupont Circle](image)\n\nDupont Circle\n* ![Edgewood](image)\n\nEdgewood\n* ![Georgetown](image)\n\nGeorgetown\n* ![Logan Circle](image)\n\nLogan Circle\n* ![Navy Yard](image)\n\nNavy Yard\n\n\nThe City of Washington was bordered by Boundary Street to the north, later renamed Florida Avenue in 1890, Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east.[51][100] Washington, D.C.'s street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888.[106] Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.[52] Some streets are particularly noteworthy, including Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House to the Capitol, and K Street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.[107] Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, located on the north and south sides of the National Mall, respectively, are home to many of Washington's iconic museums, including the Smithsonian Institution buildings and the National Archives Building. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, many of which are on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.[108]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Lincoln Memorial (foreground), Washington Monument (center), and U.S. Capitol (background) are each built in the Neoclassical motif.\n![](image)The Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront along the Potomac River\n![](image)Victorian houses in Dupont Circle\nThe architecture of Washington, D.C., varies greatly and is generally popular among tourists and locals. In 2007, six of the top ten buildings in the American Institute of Architects' ranking of America's Favorite Architecture were in the city:[109] the White House, Washington National Cathedral, the Jefferson Memorial, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The neoclassical, Georgian, Gothic, and Modern styles are reflected among these six structures and many other prominent edifices in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany of the government buildings, monuments, and museums along the National Mall and surrounding areas are heavily inspired by classical Roman and Greek architecture. The designs of the White House, the U.S. Capitol, Supreme Court Building, Washington Monument, National Gallery of Art, Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial are all heavily drawn from these classical architectural movements and feature large pediments, domes, columns in classical order, and heavy stone walls. Notable exceptions to the city's classical-style architecture include buildings constructed in the French Second Empire style, including the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.[110] The Thomas Jefferson Building, the main Library of Congress building, and the historic Willard Hotel are built in Beaux-Arts style, popular throughout the world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [111][112] Meridian Hill Park contains a cascading waterfall with Italian renaissance-style architecture.[113]\n\n\nModern, Postmodern, contemporary, and other non-classical architectural styles are also seen in the city's buildings. The National Museum of African American History and Culture deeply contrasts the stone-based neoclassical buildings on the National Mall with a design that combines modern engineering with heavy inspiration from African art.[114] The interior of the Washington Metro stations and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden are designed with strong influence from the 20th-century Brutalism movement.[115] The Smithsonian Institution Building is built of Seneca red sandstone in the Norman Revival style.[116] The Old Post Office building, located on Pennsylvania Avenue and completed in 1899, was the first building in the city to have a steel frame structure and the first to utilize electrical wiring in its design.[117]\n\n\nNotable contemporary residential buildings, restaurants, shops, and office buildings in the city include the Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront, Navy Yard along the Anacostia River, and CityCenterDC in Downtown. The Wharf, given its proximity to the Potomac River, has seen the construction of several high-rise office and residential buildings overlooking the river. Additionally, restaurants, bars, and shops have been opened at street level. Many of these buildings have a modern glass exterior and heavy curvature.[118][119] CityCenterDC is home to Palmer Alley, a pedestrian-only walkway, and houses several apartment buildings, restaurants, and luxury-brand storefronts with streamlined glass and metal facades.[120]\n\n\nOutside Downtown D.C., architectural styles are more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, ChÃ¢teauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian Revival, Beaux-Arts, and a variety of Victorian styles.[121] Rowhouses are prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federal and late Victorian designs.[122] Georgetown's Old Stone House, built in 1765, is the oldest-standing building in the city.[123] Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture.[110] The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the district with a total area of approximately 3.1Â million squareÂ feet (288,000Â m2).[124] Washington Union Station is designed from a combination of different architectural styles. Its Great Hall, which serves as the main hall within the building, has elaborate gold leaf designs along the ceilings and the hall includes several decorative classical-style statues.[125]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %Â± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 8,144 |  | â |\n| 1810 | 15,471 |  | 90.0% |\n| 1820 | 23,336 |  | 50.8% |\n| 1830 | 30,261 |  | 29.7% |\n| 1840 | 33,745 |  | 11.5% |\n| 1850 | 51,687 |  | 53.2% |\n| 1860 | 75,080 |  | 45.3% |\n| 1870 | 131,700 |  | 75.4% |\n| 1880 | 177,624 |  | 34.9% |\n| 1890 | 230,392 |  | 29.7% |\n| 1900 | 278,718 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1910 | 331,069 |  | 18.8% |\n| 1920 | 437,571 |  | 32.2% |\n| 1930 | 486,869 |  | 11.3% |\n| 1940 | 663,091 |  | 36.2% |\n| 1950 | 802,178 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1960 | 763,956 |  | â4.8% |\n| 1970 | 756,510 |  | â1.0% |\n| 1980 | 638,333 |  | â15.6% |\n| 1990 | 606,900 |  | â4.9% |\n| 2000 | 572,059 |  | â5.7% |\n| 2010 | 601,723 |  | 5.2% |\n| 2020 | 689,545 |  | 14.6% |\n| Source:[126] [e][47][127] Note:[f]2010â2020[3] |\n\n\n\n\n| Demographic profile\n | 2020[129] | 2010[130] | 1990[131] | 1970[131] | 1940[131] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 39.6% | 38.5% | 29.6% | 27.7% | 71.5%\n |\n| Â âNon-Hispanic whites | 38.0% | 34.8% | 27.4% | 26.5%[g] | 71.4%\n |\n| Black or African American | 41.4% | 50.7% | 65.8% | 71.1% | 28.2%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race)\n | 11.3% | 9.1% | 5.4% | 2.1%[g] | 0.1%\n |\n| Asian | 4.8% | 3.5% | 1.8% | 0.6% | 0.2%\n |\n\n\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in the Washington metropolitan area, according to the 2010 U.S. census. Each dot represents 25 people: **White**, **Black**, **Asian**, **Hispanic** or **Other** (yellow)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the district's population was 705,749 as of July 2019, an increase of more than 100,000 people compared to the 2010 United States Census. When measured on a decade-over-decade basis, this continues a growth trend since 2000, following a half-century of population decline.[132] But on a year-over-year basis, the July 2019 census count shows a population decline of 16,000 individuals over the preceding 12-month period.[133][*unreliable source?*] Washington was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010[update].[134] According to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over a million.[135] If the district were a state it would rank 49th in population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming.[136]\n\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area, which includes the district and surrounding suburbs, is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. with an estimated six million residents as of 2016.[137] When the Washington area is included with Baltimore and its suburbs, it forms the vast WashingtonâBaltimore combined statistical area. With a population exceeding 9.8Â million residents in 2020, it is the third-largest combined statistical area in the country.[138]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 4,410 homeless people in Washington, D.C.[139][140]\n\n\nAccording to 2017 Census Bureau data, the population of Washington, D.C. was 47.1% Black or African American, 45.1% White (36.8% non-Hispanic White), 4.3% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Individuals from two or more races made up 2.7% of the population. Hispanics of any race made up 11.0% of the district's population.[136]\n\n\nWashington, D.C. has had a significant African American population since the city's foundation.[141] African American residents composed about 30% of the district's total population between 1800 and 1940.[47] The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. Partly as a result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.[142] According to a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, D.C. has experienced more \"intense\" gentrification than any other American city, with 40% of neighborhoods gentrified.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 17% of Washington, D.C. residents were age 18 or younger as of 2010, lower than the U.S. average of 24%. However, at 34 years old, the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states as of 2010.[144] As of 2010[update], there were an estimated 81,734 immigrants living in Washington, D.C.[145] Major sources of immigration include El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mexico, Guatemala, and China, with a concentration of Salvadorans in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood.[146]\n\n\nAs of 2010, there were 4,822 same-sex couples in the city, about 2% of total households, according to Williams Institute.[147] Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009, and the district began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.[148]\n\n\n\nReligious buildings in Washington, D.C.\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSeveral major religious buildings in Washington, D.C. (left to right from the top): The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Adas Israel Synagogue, Islamic Center of Washington, and Calvary Baptist Church\n\nAs of 2007, approximately a third of Washington, D.C., residents were functionally illiterate compared to a national rate of about one in five. The city's relatively high illiteracy rate is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English.[149] As of 2011[update], 85% of D.C. residents ageÂ 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language.[150] Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006.[145] In 2017, the median household income in D.C. was $77,649;[151] also in 2017, D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $50,832 (higher than any of the 50 states).[151][152] However, 19% of residents were below the poverty level in 2005, higher than any state except Mississippi. In 2019, the poverty rate stood at 14.7%.[153][h][155]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], more than 90% of Washington, D.C., residents had health insurance coverage, the second-highest rate in the nation. This is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage.[156] A 2009 report found that at least three percent of Washington, D.C., residents have HIV or AIDS, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) characterizes as a \"generalized and severe\" epidemic.[157]\n\n\nOf the district's population, 17% are Baptist, 13% are Catholic, 6% are evangelical Protestant, 4% are Methodist, 3% are Episcopalian or Anglican, 3% are Jewish, 2% are Eastern Orthodox, 1% are Pentecostal, 1% are Buddhist, 1% are Adventist, 1% are Lutheran, 1% are Muslim, 1% are Presbyterian, 1% are Mormon, and 1% are Hindu.[158][i] The city is populated with many religious buildings, including the Washington National Cathedral, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, which comprises the largest Catholic church building in the United States, and the Islamic Center of Washington, which was the largest mosque in the Western Hemisphere when opened in 1957. St. John's Episcopal Church, located off Lafayette Square, has held services for every U.S. president since James Madison. The Sixth & I Historic Synagogue, built in 1908, is a synagogue located in the Chinatown section of the city. The Washington D.C. Temple is a large Mormon temple located just outside the city in Kensington, Maryland. Viewable from the Capital Beltway, the temple is the tallest Mormon temple in existence and the third-largest by square footage.[159][160]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McPherson Square in Downtown\nAs of 2023, the Washington metropolitan area, including District of Columbia as well as parts of Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, was one of the nation's largest metropolitan economies. Its growing and diversified economy has an increasing percentage of professional and business service jobs in addition to more traditional jobs rooted in tourism, entertainment, and government.[161][*obsoleteÂ source*]\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2016, gross domestic product per capita in Washington, D.C., consistently ranked at the very top among U.S. states.[162] In 2016, at $160,472, its GDP per capita was almost three times greater than that of Massachusetts, which was ranked second in the nation.[162]\nAs of 2022[update], the metropolitan statistical area's unemployment rate was 3.1%, ranking 171 out of the 389 metropolitan areas as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.[163] The District of Columbia itself had an unemployment rate of 4.6% during the same time period.[164] In 2019, Washington, D.C., had the highest median household income in the U.S. at $92,266.[165]\n\n\nAccording to the District's comprehensive annual financial reports, the top employers by number of employees in 2022 included Georgetown University, Children's National Medical Center, Washington Hospital Center, George Washington University, American University, Georgetown University Hospital, Booz Allen & Hamilton, Insperity PEO Services, Universal Protection Service, Howard University, Medstar Medical Group, George Washington University Hospital, Catholic University of America, and Sibley Memorial Hospital.[166]\n\n\n\n### Federal government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal government of the United States\n\n![](image)Federal Triangle, a historic hub of executive departments of the U.S. federal government\nAs of July 2022, 25% of people employed in Washington, D.C., were employed by the federal government.[167] The vast majority of these government employees serve in various executive branch departments, agencies, and institutions, and only a small percentage serve as temporary staff for presidents, Congress members, or in the federal judiciary.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany of the region's residents work for companies and organizations that sign contracts with the federal government or work on issues directly related to the work of the federal government, including law firms, defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations, many of which have their headquarters in or near Washington, D.C., in order to maintain proximity to the federal government. The largest U.S. government agencies located in or near the city are: the United States Department of Defense headquartered in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the United States Postal Service, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Department of Justice.[168]\n\n\n\n### Diplomacy and global finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States\nWashington, D.C. hosts more than 175 embassies, ambassador's residences and international cultural centers. Embassy Row is the informal name given to a stretch of Massachusetts Avenue that is occupied by many of the city's foreign embassies.[169] Washington, D.C., is one of the most diverse cities in the world.[170] In 2008, the foreign diplomatic corps in the city employed approximately 10,000 people and contributed an estimated $400Â million annually to the local economy.[171]\n\n\nMany prominent global financial and diplomatic institutions are headquartered in the city, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Pan American Health Organization. These institutions seek to use money lending and run development programs, among other financial and economic tools, to improve the economy and development of countries across the globe.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which is the central bank of the U.S., is located on Constitution Avenue. Commonly called The Fed, its policies are made by the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Through monetary policy, the Board adjusts various interest rates in the U.S., which heavily impacts the U.S. economy and economies for countries across the world. Because of the power of the U.S. dollar, the actions of the Board are monitored closely by political, economic, and diplomatic leaders around the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Research and non-profit organizations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)K Street, historically a hub for lobbying firms and advocacy groups\n![](image)The United States Institute of Peace, a Foggy Bottom-based foreign policy think tank created by federal legislation in 1984\nWashington, D.C., is a leading center for national and international research organizations, especially think tanks that engage in public policy.[172] Several of the nation's largest and most cited think tanks are headquartered in the city, including the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Peterson Institute for International Economics, The Heritage Foundation, Urban Institute, and others.[173] As of 2020, 8% of the country's think tanks are headquartered in Washington, D.C.[174] Many non-think tanks are also leading research centers, such as the MedStar Washington Hospital Center and the Children's National Medical Center.[175]\n\n\nThe city is home to many non-profit organizations that engage with issues of domestic and global importance by conducting advanced research, running programs, or advocating on behalf of people. Many of these organizations are headquartered or have major offices in the city. Among these organizations are the UN Foundation, Human Rights Campaign, Amnesty International, and the National Endowment for Democracy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city is also the country's primary location for international development firms, many of whom find funding by contracting with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which is the U.S. federal government's aid agency and is located in the city. The American Red Cross, a humanitarian agency focused on emergency relief, is also headquartered in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Private sector[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Companies based in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Bond Building, built in 1901, a historic office building in Downtown\n![](image)Headquarters of Jones Day, the nation's ninth-largest law firm as of 2023\nAccording to statistics compiled in 2011, four of the largest 500 companies in the country were headquartered in Washington, D.C.[176] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Washington was ranked as having the 14th most competitive financial center in the world, and fourth most competitive in the United States (after New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles).[177] Among the largest companies headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area are Fannie Mae, Amtrak, Lockheed Martin, Marriot International, Hilton Worldwide, Danaher Corporation, FTI Consulting, and Hogan Lovells.[178]\n\n\nDue to the building height restrictions in Washington, D.C., taller buildings are able to be built in suburban Maryland and Virginia. Capital One Bank, which is one of the largest banks in the country, is headquartered in nearby Tysons, Virginia, a large and growing financial center located in Fairfax County, Virginia. The headquarters building for Capital One Bank, known as Capital One Tower, is the tallest occupied building in the Washington region. In 2018, Amazon announced it would build a second headquarters building, known as HQ2, in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, which is located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.[179] In addition to Capital One, some of the largest companies headquartered in Northern Virginia include Hilton, Navy Federal Credit Union, Mars, Freddie Mac, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics.[180]\n\n\nThe Washington, D.C., economy also benefits from being home to many prominent news and media organizations. Among these are *The Washington Post*, *The Washington Times*, *Politico*, and *The Hill*. Television and radio media organizations either headquartered in or near the city or with large offices in the region, include CNN, PBS, C-SPAN, CBS, NBC, Discovery, and NPR, and others. The Gannett Company, which owns *USA Today*, the nation's largest circulation newspaper, and other media outlets, is headquartered in Tysons, Virginia.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St. Regis Hotel on 16th Street\nTourism is the city's second-largest industry, after the federal government. Approximately 18.9Â million visitors contributed an estimated $4.8Â billion to the local economy in 2012.[183] In 2019, the number of tourists who visited the city increased to 24.6 million, of which 22.8 million were domestic tourists. In total, the tourists spent $8.15 billion during their stay.[184] This heavy tourism helps many of the region's other industries, such as lodging, food and beverage, entertainment, shopping, and transportation.[184] Additionally, tourism helps the city maintain a robust network of world-class museums and cultural centers, most notably the Smithsonian Institution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city and wider Washington region has a diverse array of attractions for tourists, such as monuments, memorials, museums, sports events, and trails. Within the city, the National Mall serves as the center of the tourism industry. It is there that many of the city's museums and monuments are located. Adjacent to the mall sits the Tidal Basin, where several additional memorials and monuments lie, including the popular Jefferson Memorial. Additionally, Union Station is a very popular tourist spot with its multitude of restaurants and shops.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAmong the most visited tourist destinations is Arlington National Cemetery in nearby Arlington County, Virginia.[185] This is a military cemetery that serves as a burial ground for former military combatants. It is also the location of President John F. Kennedy's tomb, marked by an eternal flame.[186] President William Howard Taft is also buried in Arlington.[187] The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located in the cemetery and is guarded 24/7 by a tomb guard. The changing of the guard is a popular tourist attraction and occurs once every hour from October through March and every half-hour during the rest of the year.[188]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSymbols of District of Columbia| Slogan | Federal City |\n| Living insignia |\n| Bird | Wood Thrush |\n| Crustacean | Hay's Spring amphipod |\n| Fish | American shad |\n| Flower | American Beauty rose |\n| Mammal | Little brown bat |\n| Tree | Scarlet Oak |\n| Inanimate insignia |\n| Beverage | Rickey[189] |\n| Dance | Hand dancing |\n| Dinosaur | *Capitalsaurus* |\n| Food | Cherry |\n| Rock | Potomac bluestone |\n| Route marker |\n| ![District of Columbia Route 295 marker](image)\n |\n| State quarter |\n| ![quarter dollar coin](image)Released in 2009\n |\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Washington, D.C.\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theater in Washington, D.C. and Music of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Kennedy Center, home to the Washington National Opera and National Symphony Orchestra\n![](image)The Howard Theatre is located in the Shaw neighborhood.\nWashington, D.C. is a national center for the arts and houses several concert halls and theaters. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, and the Washington Ballet. The Kennedy Center Honors are awarded each year to those in the performing arts who have contributed greatly to the cultural life of the United States. This ceremony is often attended by the sitting U.S. president and other dignitaries and celebrities.[190] The Kennedy Center also awards the annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe historic Ford's Theatre, site of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, continues to function as a theatre and as a museum.[191]\n\n\nThe Marine Barracks near Capitol Hill houses the United States Marine Band; founded in 1798, it is the country's oldest professional musical organization.[192] American march composer and Washington-native John Philip Sousa led the Marine Band from 1880 until 1892.[193] Founded in 1925, the United States Navy Band has its headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard and performs at official events and public concerts around the city.[194]\n\n\nFounded in 1950, Arena Stage achieved national attention and spurred growth in the city's independent theater movement that now includes organizations such as the Shakespeare Theatre Company, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, and the Studio Theatre.[195] Arena Stage opened its newly renovated home in the city's emerging Southwest waterfront area in 2010.[196] The GALA Hispanic Theatre, now housed in the historic Tivoli Theatre in Columbia Heights, was founded in 1976 and is a National Center for the Latino Performing Arts.[197]\n\n\nOther performing arts spaces in the city include the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Federal Triangle, the Atlas Performing Arts Center on H Street, the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Rock Creek Park, Constitution Hall in Downtown, the National Theatre in Downtown, the Keegan Theatre in Dupont Circle, the Lisner Auditorium in Foggy Bottom, the Sylvan Theater on the National Mall, and the Warner Theatre in Penn Quarter.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe U Street Corridor in Northwest D.C., once known as \"Washington's Black Broadway\", is home to institutions like Howard Theatre and Lincoln Theatre, which hosted music legends such as Washington-native Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis.[198] Just east of U Street is Shaw, which also served as a major cultural center during the jazz age. Intersecting with U Street is Fourteenth Street, which was an extension of the U Street cultural corridor during the 1920s through the 1960s. The collection of Fourteenth Street, U Street, and Shaw was the location of the Black Renaissance in D.C., which was part of the larger Harlem Renaissance. Today, the area starting at Fourteenth Street downtown going north through U Street and east to Shaw boasts a high concentration of bars, restaurants, and theaters, and is among the city's most notable cultural and artistic areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Records, a major music record label in the US, was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1889.[199][200] The city grew into being one of the most important music cities in the early jazz age. Duke Ellington, among the most prominent jazz composers and musicians of his time, was born and raised in Washington, and began his music career there.\n\n\nWashington has its own native music genre called go-go; a post-funk, percussion-driven flavor of rhythm and blues that was popularized in the late 1970s by D.C. band leader Chuck Brown.[201]\n\n\nThe district is an important center for indie culture and music in the United States. The label Dischord Records, formed by Ian MacKaye, frontman of Fugazi, was one of the most crucial independent labels in the genesis of 1980s punk and eventually indie rock in the 1990s.[202] Modern alternative and indie music venues like The Black Cat and the 9:30 Club bring popular acts to the U Street area.[203] The hardcore punk scene in the city, known as D.C. hardcore, is an important genre of D.C.'s contemporary music scene. Starting in the 1970s, it is considered to be one of the most influential punk music movements in the country.[204]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Michelin starred restaurants in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Ben's Chili Bowl, known for its half-smoke, a historic staple of the city's cuisine\n![](image)Washington has the largest population of Ethiopians outside of Africa. Many have opened restaurants throughout the city. A portion of Shaw is nicknamed \"little Ethiopia\".\nWashington, D.C. is rich in both fine and casual dining and is considered by some to be one of the best cities for dining in the United States.[205] The city has a diverse range of restaurants, including a wide variety of international cuisines.[206] The city's Chinatown, for example, is filled with Chinese-style restaurants. The city also has many Middle Eastern, European, African, Asian, and Latin American cuisine options. D.C. is known for being one of the best cities in the world for Ethiopian cuisine, due in part to the heavy influx of Ethiopian immigrants during the 20th century, many of whom opened restaurants in the city.[207] A part of the Shaw neighborhood in central D.C. is known as \"Little Ethiopia\" and has a high concentration of Ethiopian restaurants and shops.[208]\n\n\nAmong the most famous Washington, D.C.-born foods is the half-smoke, which is a half-beef, half-pork sausage placed in a hotdog-style bun and topped with onion, chilly, and cheese.[209] Additionally, the city is the birthplace of mumbo sauce, a type of condiment often placed on meat and french fries. This sauce is similar to barbecue sauce but sweeter in flavor.[210][211] Washington, D.C. is also known for popularizing the jumbo slice pizza, which is an enlarged New York-style pizza.[212][213][214] The jumbo slice has particular roots in the Adams Morgan neighborhood.[215] Union Market, located in Northeast D.C., is a former farmer's market and wholesale that now houses a large, gourmet food hall.

Wilson Building is the headquarters for much of the Government of the District of Columbia, including the offices of the mayor and D.C. Council.\nArticle One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the city. The district did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.[269] Washington, D.C., is overwhelmingly Democratic, having voted for the Democratic presidential candidate solidly since it was granted electoral votes in 1964.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEach of the city's eight wards elects a single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the district as a whole. The council chair is also elected at-large.[270] There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration.[271] The attorney general of the District of Columbia is elected to a four-year term.[272]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., observes all federal holidays and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the district.[46] The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family coat of arms.[273]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2015.[274]\n\n\nThe idiom \"Inside the Beltway\" is a reference used by media to describe discussions of national political issues inside of Washington, by way of geographical demarcation regarding the region within the Capital's Beltway, Interstate 495, the city's highway loop (beltway) constructed in 1964. The phrase is used as a title for a number of political columns and news items by publications like *The Washington Times*.[275]\n\n\n\n### Budgetary issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judiciary Square, home to many city and federal government agencies and institutions, including the DC Superior Court, the DC Court of Appeals, the Metropolitan Police Department, Washington Metro, and One Judiciary Square\nThe mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470Â million and over $1Â billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.[276][277]\n\n\nThe city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, has been criticized for mismanagement and waste.[278] During his administration in 1989, *Washington Monthly* magazine labeled the district \"the worst city government in America\".[279] In 1995, at the start of Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending.[280] Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe district regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.[281]\n\n\nThe district has a federally funded \"Emergency Planning and Security Fund\" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. During the Trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. Trump's January 2017 inauguration cost the city $27Â million; of that, $7Â million was never repaid to the fund. Trump's 2019 Independence Day event, \"A Salute to America\", cost six times more than Independence Day events in past years.[282]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights debate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District of Columbia voting rights and Political party strength in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The city's license plate calls for an end to taxation without representation.\nWashington, D.C. is not a state and therefore has no federal voting representation in Congress. The city's residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives (D.C. at-large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The district has no official representation in the United States Senate. Neither chamber seats the district's elected \"shadow\" representative or senators. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all federal taxes.[283] In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7Â billion in federal taxes, more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.[284]\n\n\nA 2005 poll found that 78% of Americans did not know residents of Washington, D.C., have less representation in Congress than residents of the 50 states.[285] Efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, \"End Taxation Without Representation\", on D.C. vehicle license plates.[286] There is evidence of nationwide approval for D.C. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of Americans believe D.C. should have voting representation in Congress.[285][287]\n\n\nOpponents to federal voting rights for Washington, D.C., propose that the Founding Fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making District of Columbia a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.[288]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThe city passed a law that requires shelter to be provided to everyone in need when the temperature drops below freezing.[289] Since D.C. does not have enough shelter units available, every winter it books hotel rooms in the suburbs with an average cost around $100 for a night. According to the D.C. Department of Human Services, during the winter of 2012 the city spent $2,544,454 on putting homeless families in hotels,[290] and budgeted $3.2 million on hotel beds in 2013.[291]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District of Columbia Public Schools and List of parochial and private schools in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a public magnet school in the city\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), the sole public school district in the city,[292] operates the city's 123 public schools.[293] The number of students in DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009. In the 2010â11 school year, 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system.[294] DCPS has one of the highest-cost, yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, in terms of both infrastructure and student achievement.[295] Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development.[296]\n\n\nThe District of Columbia Public Charter School Board monitors the 52 public charter schools in the city.[297] Due to the perceived problems with the traditional public school system, enrollment in public charter schools had by 2007 steadily increased.[298] As of 2010, D.C., charter schools had a total enrollment of about 32,000, a 9% increase from the prior year.[294] The district is also home to 92 private schools, which enrolled approximately 18,000 students in 2008.[299]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Georgetown University, founded in 1789, is the city's oldest university.\nThe University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public land-grant university providing undergraduate and graduate education.[*citation needed*] Federally chartered universities include American University (AU), Gallaudet University, George Washington University (GWU), Georgetown University (GU), and Howard University (HU).

Other publications based in Washington include the *National Geographic* magazine and political publications such as *The Washington Examiner*, *The New Republic*, and *Washington Monthly*.[315] *USA Today*, which is the largest newspaper in the country as measured by circulation, as well as its parent company Gannett, which is the largest newspaper publisher in the United States,[316] are both headquartered in nearby Tysons, Virginia.[317][318]\n\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area is the ninth-largest television media market in the nation, with two million homes, representing approximately 2% of the country's television market.[319] Several media companies and cable television channels have their headquarters in the area, including C-SPAN, Radio One, the National Geographic Channel, Smithsonian Networks, National Public Radio (NPR), Travel Channel (in Chevy Chase, Maryland), Discovery Communications (in Silver Spring, Maryland), and PBS (in Arlington County, Virginia). The headquarters of Voice of America, the U.S. government's international news service, is near the Capitol in Southwest Washington, D.C.[320]\n\n\nThe city is served by two local NPR affiliates, WAMU and WETA.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Washington, D.C.\n\n#### Streets and highways[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of circles in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Pennsylvania Avenue, one of the city's most prominent streets\nThere are 1,500 miles (2,400Â km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district.[321] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built. InterstateÂ 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.[322] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city.[323]\n\n\nAccording to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70Â hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.[324] However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.[325] An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Cycling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Capital Bikeshare rental station near McPherson Square\nIn May 2022, the city celebrated the expansion of its bike lane network to 104 miles (167Â km), a 60 percent increase from 2015. Of those miles, 24 miles (39Â km) were protected bike lanes. It also boasted 62 miles (100Â km) of bike trails.[327] As of MarchÂ 2023,[update] the city has 108 miles (174Â km) of bike lanes, with 30 miles (48Â km) of them protected bike lanes.[328]\n\n\nD.C. is part of the regional Capital Bikeshare program. Started in 2010, it is one of the largest bicycle sharing systems in the country with more than 4,351 bicycles and more than 395 stations,[329] all provided by PBSC Urban Solutions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Walkability[edit]\n\n\nA 2021 study by Walk Score ranked Washington, D.C. the fifth-most walkable city in the country. According to the study, the most walkable neighborhoods are U Street, Dupont Circle, and Mount Vernon Square.[330] In 2013, the Washington Metropolitan Area had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8Â percent of area workers traveling via rail transit.[331]\n\n\n\n#### River crossings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of crossings of the Potomac River and List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Memorial Bridge connects the city across the Potomac River with Arlington, Virginia.\nThere are multiple transportation methods to cross the city's two rivers, the Potomac River and the Anacostia River. There are numerous bridges that take cars, trains, pedestrians, and bikers across the rivers. Among these are Arlington Memorial Bridge, the 14th Street Bridges, Francis Scott Key Bridge, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and Frederick Douglass Bridge.[332]\n\n\nThere are also ferries and water cruises that cross the Potomac River. One of these is the Potomac Water Taxi, operated by Hornblower Cruises, which goes between the Georgetown Waterfront, the Wharf, the Old Town Alexandria Waterfront, and National Harbor.[333]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of railroads in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Union Station, the 10th-busiest rail station in the nation\n![](image)Washington Metro, the second-busiest rapid rail system in the U.S. based on average weekday ridership after the New York City Subway\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit rail system. The system serves Washington, D.C. and its Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976, and consists of six lines (each one color coded), 97Â stations, and 129 miles (208Â km) of track.[334] Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country and fifth-busiest in North America.[335] It operates mostly as a deep-level subway in more densely populated parts of the D.C. metropolitan area (including most of the District itself), while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated. Metro is known for its iconic brutalist-style vaulted ceilings in the interior stations. It is also known for having long escalators in some of its underground stations. The longest single-tier escalator in the Western Hemisphere, spanning 230 feet (70Â m), is located at Metro's Wheaton station in Maryland.[336]\n\n\nUnion Station is the city's main train station and serves approximately 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6Â million passengers annually and is the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor, which carries long-distance and regional services to New York Penn Station and points in New England. As of 2023, Union Station is the ninth-busiest rail station in the nation and tenth-busiest in North America.\n\n\nMaryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.[337] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.[338]\n\n\nAlthough Washington, D.C. was known throughout the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries for its streetcars, these lines were dismantled in the 1960s. In 2016, however, the city brought back a streetcar line, DC Streetcar, which is a single line system in Northeast Washington, D.C., along H Street and Benning Road, known as the H Street/Benning Road Line.[339]\n\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)\n\n![](image)Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n![](image)DC Circulator, operated by the District Department of Transportation\nTwo main public bus systems operate in Washington, D.C. Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), is the primary public bus system in Washington, D.C. Serving more than 400,000 riders each weekday, it is one of the nation's largest bus systems by annual ridership.[340] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial and touristic areas within central Washington.[341] The DC Circulator costs only $1 to ride and is composed of six distinct routes that cover central D.C. and suburban Rosslyn, Virginia. The DC Circulator is run via a public-private partnerships between the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, WMATA, and DC Surface Transit, Inc. (DCST). The bus system services each stop approximately every 10 minutes.[342]\n\n\nMany other public bus systems operate in the various jurisdictions of the Washington region outside of the city in suburban Maryland and Virginia. Among these are the Fairfax Connector in Fairfax County, Virginia; DASH in Alexandria, Virginia; and TheBus in Prince George's County, Maryland.[343] There are also numerous commuter buses that residents of the wider Washington region take to commute into the city for work or other events. Among these are the Loudoun County Transit Commuter Bus and the Maryland Transit Administration Commuter Bus.[344]\n\n\nThe city also has several bus lines used by tourists and others visiting the city, including Big Bus Tours, Old Town Trolley Tours, and DC Trails. The city also has many charter buses used in carrying young students and other tourists from across the country to the city and region's historic sites. These buses are often found parked beside the city's most notable tourist attractions, including National Mall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aviation in Washington, D.C.; List of airports serving Washington, D.C.; and List of heliports in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia is the closest airport to the city among the three major Washington metropolitan area airports.\nThree major airports serve the district, though none are within the city's borders. Two of these major airports are located in suburban Virginia and one in suburban Maryland. The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is located in Arlington County, Virginia, just across the Potomac River about 5 miles (8Â km) from downtown Washington, D.C. This airport provides primarily domestic flights and has the lowest number of passengers of the three airports in the region. The busiest by number of total passengers is Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI), located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland about 30 miles (48Â km) northeast of the city.[345] The busiest by international flights and the largest by land size and amount of facilities is Washington Dulles International Airport, located in Dulles, Virginia, about 24 miles (39Â km) west of the city.[346] Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Washington-Baltimore region.[347] Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan National Airport is a hub for American Airlines,[348] Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners,[349] and BWI is an operating base for Southwest Airlines.[350] In 2018, the Washington, D.C. area was the 18th-busiest airport system in the world by passenger traffic, accumulating over 74 million passengers between its three main commercial airports.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe President of the United States does not use any of these airports for travel. Instead, he typically travels by Marine One from the White House South Lawn to Joint Base Andrews, located in suburban Maryland. From there, he takes Air Force One to his destination. Joint Base Andrews was built in 1942. From 1942 to 2009, it was solely an Air Force base, but became a joint Air Force and Naval base in 2009, when Andrews Air Force Base and Naval Air Facility Washington were merged into a singular entity with the creation of Joint Base Andrews.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, Pepco, and Washington Gas\n\n![](image)The headquarters of DC Water and Sewer Authority on Canal Street, SW, in 2019\nThe District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, also known as WASA or D.C. Water, is an independent authority of the Washington, D.C., government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in the city. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia, Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1Â million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.[351] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6Â million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties.[352]\n\n\nPepco is the city's electric utility and services 793,000 customers in the district and suburban Maryland.[353] An 1889 law prohibits overhead wires within much of the historic City of Washington. As a result, all power lines and telecommunication cables are located underground in downtown Washington, and traffic signals are placed at the edge of the street.[354] A 2013 plan would bury an additional 60 miles (97Â km) of primary power lines throughout the district.[355]\n\n\nWashington Gas is the city's natural gas utility and serves more than a million customers in the district and its suburbs. Incorporated by Congress in 1848, the company installed the city's first gas lights in the Capitol, White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue.[356]\n\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia\n\n![](image)Washington, D.C. police on Harley-Davidson motorcycles escort the March for Life protest on Constitution Avenue in January 2018.\nSome 67,000 residents, about 10% of the population, are ex-convicts.[357]\n\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the number of homicides continued an upward trend with over 200 homicides in both years, a significant rise from previous lows.[358] In 2012, D.C.'s annual murder count had dropped to 88, the lowest total since 1961.[359] The city was once described as the \"murder capital\" of the United States during the early 1990s.[360] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but the level of violence then began to decline significantly.[361]\n\n\nIn 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015.[362] Many neighborhoods such as Columbia Heights and Logan Circle are becoming safer and vibrant. However, incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents.[363] Even still, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s.[364]\n\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in *District of Columbia v. Heller* that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment.[365] However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.[366]\n\n\nIn addition to the Metropolitan Police Department, several federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city, including the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.[367]\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family.[368] Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy.[369] Listed in the order each agreement was first established, they are:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand (1962, renewed 2002 and 2012)\n* ![](image) Dakar, Senegal (1980, renewed 2006)\n* ![](image) Beijing, China (1984, renewed 2004 and 2012)\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium (1985, renewed 2002 and 2011)\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece (2000)\n* ![](image) Paris, France (2000 as a friendship and cooperation agreement, renewed 2005)[369][370]\n* ![](image) Pretoria, South Africa (2002, renewed 2008 and 2011)\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea (2006)\n* ![](image) Accra, Ghana (2006)\n* ![](image) Sunderland, United Kingdom (2006, renewed 2012)[368]\n* ![](image) Rome, Italy (2011, renewed 2013)[369]\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey (2011)\n* ![](image) BrasÃ­lia, Brazil (2013)\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2013)[371]\n* ![](image) San Salvador, El Salvador (2018)\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nList of people from Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Index of Washington, D.C.ârelated articles\n* Outline of Washington, D.C.\n* USS *District of Columbia*\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.[28]\n2. **^** The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast and rotated them to include Alexandria at the district's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.[29]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official records for Washington, D.C. were kept at 24th and M Streets NW from January 1872 to June 1945, and at Reagan National Airport since July 1945.[95]\n5. **^** Apportionment totals are collected by combining Resident and Overseas population.

It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.\n\n\nIndonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. It has 38 provinces, of which nine have special status. The country's capital, Jakarta, is the world's second-most populous urban area. Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity.\n\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the seventh century when the Srivijaya and later Majapahit Kingdoms traded with entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Muslim traders later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid economic change.\n\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\nThe name *Indonesia* derives from the Greek words *Indos* (á¼¸Î½Î´ÏÏ) and *nesos* (Î½á¿ÏÎ¿Ï), meaning \"Indian islands\".[12] The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[13] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms *Indunesians*âand, his preference, *Malayunesians*âfor the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\".[14] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used *Indonesia* as a synonym for *Indian Archipelago*.[15][16] Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use *Indonesia*. They preferred *Malay Archipelago* (Dutch: *Maleische Archipel*); the *Netherlands East Indies* (*Nederlandsch Oost IndiÃ«*), popularly *IndiÃ«*; *the East* (*de Oost*); and *Insulinde*.[17]\n\n\nAfter 1900, *Indonesia* became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.[17] Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularized the name through his book *Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884â1894*. The first native scholar to use the name was Ki Hajar Dewantara when in 1913, he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, *Indonesisch Pers-bureau*.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Indonesia\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Borobudur ship carved on Borobudur temple, c.â800 CE. Outrigger boats from the archipelago may have made trade voyages to the east coast of Africa and Madagascar as early as the 1st century CE.[18]\nFossilised remains of *Homo erectus*, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago.[19][20][21] *Homo sapiens* reached the region around 43,000 BCE.[22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east.[23]\n\n\nIdeal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE[24] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade, including with Indian kingdoms and Chinese dynasties, from several centuries BCE.[25] Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.[26][27]\n\n\nFrom the seventh century CE, the Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished due to trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism.[28][29] Between the eighth and tenth centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of present-day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a \"Golden Age\" in Indonesian history.[30]\n\n\nThe earliest evidence of Islamized populations in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[31] Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[32]\n\n\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)The submission of Prince Diponegoro to General De Kock at the end of the Java War in 1830\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco SerrÃ£o, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands.[33] Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony.[34]\n\n\nFor most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, and the bloody thirty-year Aceh War weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.[35][36][37] Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.[37][38][39][40]\n\n\nThe Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule[41][42][43] and encouraged the independence movement.[44] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. Then, Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir, influential nationalist leaders, were appointed president, vice-president and prime minister respectively.[45][46][47][45]\n\n\nThe Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, beginning the Indonesian National Revolution which ended in December 1949 when the Dutch recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure.[48][47] Despite extraordinary political, social, and sectarian divisions, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSukarno (*left*) and Hatta (*right*), Indonesia's founding fathers and the first President and Vice President respectively\n\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[51] Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps.[52][53][54][55] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.[56][57][58] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968. His \"New Order\" administration,[59] supported by the United States,[60][61][62] encouraged foreign direct investment,[63][64][65] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.\n\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[66] It brought out popular discontent with the New Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[41][67][68][69] In 1999, East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia[70] and a 25-year occupation marked by international condemnation of human rights abuses.[71]\n\n\nSince 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first direct presidential election in 2004.[72] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Indonesia and List of islands of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java. Indonesia's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world's highest.\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11Â°S and 6Â°N and longitudes 95Â°E and 141Â°E. A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181Â mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094Â mi) from north to south.[75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\nAt 4,884 metres (16,024Â ft), Puncak Jaya is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra is the largest lake, with an area of 1,145 km2 (442 sq mi). Indonesia's largest rivers are in Kalimantan and New Guinea and include Kapuas, Barito, Mamberamo, Sepik and Mahakam. They serve as communication and transport links between the island's river settlements.[79]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of Indonesia and Climate change in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Rainforest in Mount Palung National Park, West Kalimantan\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round.[80] Indonesia has two seasonsâa wet season and a dry seasonâwith no extremes of summer or winter.[81] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, with the wet season between November and April.[81] Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia. More cooling climate types do exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level. The oceanic climate (KÃ¶ppen *Cfb*) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (KÃ¶ppen *Cwb*) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification map of Indonesia[82]\nSome regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tends to be dry. The almost uniformly warm waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that land temperatures remain relatively constant. Humidity is quite high, at between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.[83]\n\n\nSeveral studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the projected effects of climate change.[84] These include unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around 1Â Â°C (2Â Â°F) by mid-century,[85][86] raising the frequency of drought and food shortages (with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons, and thus Indonesia's agriculture system[86]) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires.[86] Rising sea levels would also threaten most of Indonesia's population, who live in low-lying coastal areas.[86][87][88] Impoverished communities would likely be affected the most by climate change.[89]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Indonesia\n See also: Volcanoes of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Major volcanoes in Indonesia. Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire area.\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.[90] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi.[91] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active.[90] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on Java.[92] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas.[93] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali.[94]\n\n\nA massive supervolcano erupted at present-day Lake Toba around 70,000 BCE. It is believed to have caused a global volcanic winter and cooling of the climate and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution, though this is still in debate.[95] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa were among the largest in recorded history. The former caused 92,000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash that spread and blanketed parts of the archipelago and made much of the Northern Hemisphere without summer in 1816.[96] The latter produced the loudest sound in recorded history and caused 36,000 deaths due to the eruption itself and the resulting tsunamis, with significant additional effects around the world years after the event.[97] Recent catastrophic disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of Indonesia, Flora of Indonesia, and Protected areas of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSpecies endemic to Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: *Rafflesia arnoldii*; orangutan; greater bird-of-paradise; and Komodo dragon.\n\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.[98][99] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\nIndonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.[103] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline. The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[12] Indonesia is one of the Coral Triangle countries with the world's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[104]\n\n\nBritish naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line (Wallace Line) between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.[105] It runs roughly northâsouth along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali. Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally Asian, while east from Lombok is increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the Weber Line. In his 1869 book, *The Malay Archipelago*, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[106] The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)Deforestation in Riau province, Sumatra, to make way for an oil palm plantation (2007)\nIndonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues. They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]\n\n\nIndonesia has one of the world's fastest deforestation rates.[109][110] In 2020, forests covered approximately 49.1% of the country's land area,[111] down from 87% in 1950.[112] Since the 1970s, log production, various plantations and agriculture have been responsible for much of the deforestation in Indonesia.[112] Most recently, it has been driven by the palm oil industry,[113] which has been criticised for its environmental impact and displacement of local communities.[110][114] The situation has made Indonesia the world's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases.[115] It also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A presidential inauguration by the MPR in the Parliament Complex Jakarta, 2014\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches.[122] Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state.[123] The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (*Tentara Nasional Indonesia*, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[124]\n\n\nThe highest representative body at the national level is the People's Consultative Assembly (*Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat*, MPR). Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the president,[125][126] and formalising broad outlines of state policy. The MPR comprises two houses; the People's Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat*, DPR), with 575 members, and the Regional Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Daerah*, DPD), with 136.[127] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,[122] while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management.[128][126]\n\n\nMost civil disputes appear before the State Court (*Pengadilan Negeri*); appeals are heard before the High Court (*Pengadilan Tinggi*). The Supreme Court of Indonesia (*Mahkamah Agung*) is the highest level of the judicial branch and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Constitutional Court (*Mahkamah Konstitusi*) which listens to constitutional and political matters, and the Religious Court (*Pengadilan Agama*), which deals with codified Islamic Personal Law (*sharia*) cases.[129] Additionally, the Judicial Commission (*Komisi Yudisial*) monitors the performance of judges.[130]\n\n\n\n### Parties and elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of political parties in Indonesia and Elections in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo,  \n 7th President of Indonesia\n![](image)\nMa'ruf Amin,  \n 13th Vice President of Indonesia\n\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which secured the most votes in the 2019 elections, is the party of the incumbent president, Joko Widodo.[131] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups (*Golkar*), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (*Gerindra*), the Democratic Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\nThe first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly (*Konstituante*). The most recent elections in 2019 resulted in nine political parties in the DPR, with a parliamentary threshold of 4% of the national vote.[132] At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.[127][122] Beginning with the 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have occurred on the same date. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections would be held simultaneously, starting in 2019.[133]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Indonesia\n\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah*, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945,[134] with the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022.[135] The second level are the regencies (*kabupaten*) and cities (*kota*), led by regents (*bupati*) and mayors (*walikota*) respectively and a legislature (*DPRD Kabupaten/Kota*). The third level are the districts (*kecamatan*, *distrik* in Papua, or *kapanewon* and *kemantren* in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either *desa*, *kelurahan*, *kampung*, *nagari* in West Sumatra, or *gampong* in Aceh).[136]\n\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (*rukun warga*, RW), which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (*rukun tetangga*, RT). In Java, the village (*desa*) is divided into smaller units called *dusun* or *dukuh* (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles village or neighbourhood matters through an elected village head (*lurah* or *kepala desa*).[137]\n\n\nNine provincesâAceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and West Papuaâare granted a special autonomous status (*otonomi khusus*) from the central government. A conservative Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing *sharia*.[138] Jakarta is the only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[142]\n\n\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Indonesia provinces labelled map.

Numerous attempts by the United States and the Soviet Union,[146][147] and China to some degree,[148] culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a reorientation of foreign policy.[149] Quiet alignment with the Western world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign policy since then.[150] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit. In common with most of the Muslim world, Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported Palestine. However, observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[151]\n\n\nIndonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[153] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a former member of OPEC.[154] Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1967,[155][156] and recently, the country established its first overseas aid programme in late 2019.[157]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian National Armed Forces and Military history of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian Armed Forces. **Clockwise from top**: Indonesian Army during training session; Sukhoi Su-30; Pindad Anoa; and Indonesian naval vessel Error: {{Ship}} invalid control parameter: 4 (help).\n\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNIâAD), Navy (TNIâAL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNIâAU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of GDP in 2018,[158] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations.[159] The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia. Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats.[160] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which peaked during the New Order. Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the legislature. Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level.[161]\n\n\nSince independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[162] Some, notably in Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.[163][164][165] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[74] while the latter has continued amid a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses as of 2006.[166] Other engagements of the army include the conflict against the Netherlands over the Dutch New Guinea, the opposition to the British-sponsored creation of Malaysia (\"Konfrontasi\"), the mass killings of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the invasion of East Timor, which remains Indonesia's most massive military operation.[167][168]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Indonesia and Economic history of Indonesia\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Vast palm oil plantation in Bogor Regency, West Java. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil.[169]\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles.[170] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia,[171] the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country. Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.417 trillion and US$4.393 trillion, respectively. Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,835, while nominal per capita GDP is US$5,108.[7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%).[172] Since 2009, it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%).[173]\n\n\nOver time, the structure of the economy has changed considerably.[174] Historically, it has been weighted heavily towards agriculture, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency.[174] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports.[174] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock, during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. As a result, the official poverty rate fell from 60% to 15%.[175] Trade barriers reduction from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally integrated. The growth ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis that severely impacted the economy, including a 13.1% real GDP contraction in 1998 and a 78% inflation. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.[176]\n\n\nRelatively steady inflation[177] and an increase in GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index[178] have contributed to strong economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2019, annual growth accelerated to between 4% and 6% due to improvements in the banking sector and domestic consumption,[179] helping Indonesia weather the 2008â2009 Great Recession,[180] and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997.[181] As of 2019[update], 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty line, and the official open unemployment rate was 5.28%.[182] During the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the economy suffered its first recession since the 1997 crisis but recovered in the following year.[183]\n\n\nIndonesia has abundant natural resources. Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth, tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans, bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[184] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States, Japan, Singapore, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia's principal export markets and import partners.[185]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTransport modes in Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: TransJakarta bus; Whoosh high-speed train; Garuda Indonesia airliner; and Pelni ship.\n\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275Â million people highly concentrated on Java.[186] All transport modes play a role in the country's transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[187]\n\n\nThe road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018[update].[188] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes.[189] Rickshaws such as *bajaj* and *becak* and share taxis such as *Angkot* and *Minibus* are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nMost railways are in Java, and partly Sumatra and Sulawesi,[190] used for freight and passenger transport, such as local commuter rail services (mainly in Greater Jakarta and YogyakartaâSolo) complementing the inter-city rail network in several cities. In the late 2010s, Jakarta and Palembang were the first cities in Indonesia to have rapid transit systems, with more planned for other cities in the future.[191] In 2023, a high-speed rail connecting the cities of Jakarta and Bandung commenced operations, a first for Southeast Asia and the Southern Hemisphere.[192]\n\n\nIndonesia's largest airport, SoekarnoâHatta International Airport, is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere, serving 54Â million passengers in 2019. Ngurah Rai International Airport and Juanda International Airport are the country's second-and third-busiest airport, respectively. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flag carrier since 1949, is one of the world's leading airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam. The Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced Indonesian port,[193] handling more than 50% of Indonesia's trans-shipment cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Sidrap wind farm, Indonesia's first wind power plant, in Sidrap Regency, South Sulawesi\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059Â quadrillion British thermal units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043Â quadrillion British thermal units) worth of energy.[194] The country has substantial energy resources, including 22Â billion barrels (3.5Â billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4Â billion barrels are recoverable), 8Â billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28Â billion tonnes of recoverable coal.[195]\n\n\nIn late 2020, Indonesia's total national installed power generation capacity stands at 72,750.72 MW.[196] Although reliance on domestic coal and imported oil has increased between 2010 and 2019,[194][197] Indonesia has seen progress in renewable energy, with hydropower and geothermal being the most abundant sources that account for more than 8% in the country's energy mix.[194] A prime example of the former is the country's largest dam, Jatiluhur, which has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW that feeds into the Java grid managed by the State Electricity Company (*Perusahaan Listrik Negara*, PLN). Furthermore, Indonesia has the potential for solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy,[198] although as of 2021, power generation from these sources remain small.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Palapa satellite launch in 1984\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019),[199] and Indonesia only ranked 61st on the 2023 Global Innovation Index report up from 87th in 2021.[200][201] Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique *terasering*, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people.[202] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in several countries.[203] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad.[204]\n\n\nIndonesia has a long history of developing military and small commuter aircraft. It is the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft. The state-owned Indonesian Aerospace company (*PT. Dirgantara Indonesia*) has provided components for Boeing and Airbus.[205] The company also collaborated with EADS CASA of Spain to develop the CN-235, which has been used by several countries.[206] Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this achievement.[207] Indonesia has also joined the South Korean programme to manufacture the 4.5-generation fighter jet KAI KF-21 Boramae.[208]\n\n\nIndonesia has a space programme and space agency, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (*Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional*, LAPAN). In the 1970s, Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system called Palapa,[209] a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1, was launched on 8 July 1976 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.[210] As of 2019[update], Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for various purposes.[211]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Indonesia\n![](image)Borobudur in Central Java, the world's largest Buddhist temple, is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.[212]\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors.[213] Overall, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia.[214] Since 2011, *Wonderful Indonesia* has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism.[215]\n\n\n\n![](image)Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua, has the highest recorded level of diversity in marine life, according to Conservation International.[216]\nNature and culture are prime attractions of Indonesian tourism. The country has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rainforests stretching over about 57% of Indonesia's land (225Â million acres). Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of the world's longest coastlines, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999Â mi). The ancient Borobudur and Prambanan temples, as well as Toraja and Bali with their traditional festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.[217]\n\n\nIndonesia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Komodo National Park and the Sawahlunto Coal Mine; and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes Bunaken National Park and Raja Ampat Islands.[218] Other attractions include specific points in Indonesian history, such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East Indies in the old towns of Jakarta and Semarang and the royal palaces of Pagaruyung, Ubud, and Yogyakarta.[217]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Indonesia and Indonesians\n\nSee also: List of Indonesian cities by population and List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Indonesia's ten metropolitan areas labeled with their populations\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2Â million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%.[219] Java is the world's most populous island,[220] where 56% of the country's population lives.[6] The population density is 141 people per km2 (365 per sq mi),[6] ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 (2,435 per sq mi). In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97Â million people.[221] It is expected to grow to around 295Â million by 2030 and 321Â million by 2050.[222] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate).[77]\n\n\nThe spread of the population is uneven throughout the archipelago, with a varying habitats and levels of development, ranging from the megacity of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in Papua.[223] As of 2017, about 54.7% of the population lives in urban areas.[224] Jakarta is the country's primate city and the second-most populous urban area globally, with over 34Â million residents.[225] About 8Â million Indonesians live overseas; most settled in Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, South Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia.[226]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities in Indonesia2023 BPS estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Jakarta](image)Jakarta![Surabaya](image)Surabaya | 1 | Jakarta | Special Capital Region of Jakarta | 11,350,328 | 11 | South Tangerang | Banten | 1,404,785\n | ![Bekasi](image)Bekasi![Bandung](image)Bandung |\n| 2 | Surabaya | East Java | 3,009,286 | 12 | Batam | Riau Islands | 1,269,820\n |\n| 3 | Bekasi | West Java | 2,627,207 | 13 | Bandar Lampung | Lampung | 1,209,937\n |\n| 4 | Bandung | West Java | 2,506,603 | 14 | Bogor | West Java | 1,127,408\n |\n| 5 | Medan | North Sumatra | 2,494,512 | 15 | Pekanbaru | Riau | 1,007,540\n |\n| 6 | Depok | West Java | 2,145,400 | 16 | Padang | West Sumatra | 919,145\n |\n| 7 | Tangerang | Banten | 1,912,679 | 17 | Malang | East Java | 847,182\n |\n| 8 | Palembang | South Sumatra | 1,729,546 | 18 | Samarinda | East Kalimantan | 834,824\n |\n| 9 | Semarang | Central Java | 1,694,740 | 19 | Tasikmalaya | West Java | 741,760\n |\n| 10 | Makassar | South Sulawesi | 1,474,393 | 20 | Denpasar | Bali | 726,808\n |\n\n### Ethnic groups and languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethnic groups in Indonesia, Native Indonesians, and Languages of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A map of ethnic groups in Indonesia\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups.[2] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands).[23][227][228][229]\n\n\nThe Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,[2] and are politically dominant.[230] They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also in sizeable numbers in most provinces. The Sundanese are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, Bugis and Malay people.[d] A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[231]\n\n\nThe country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, which had been the archipelago's *lingua franca* for centuries. It was promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945 under the name *Bahasa Indonesia*.[232] Due to centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences.[e] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages,[1] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[1] Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken[77] and has co-official status in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.[236]\n\n\nIn 1930, Dutch and other Europeans (*Totok*), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of the total population.[237] Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today. Also, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years.[238] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[239] Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[240] as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.[241]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1â3Â million) and 0.2% (200,000â400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hindu prayer ceremony at Besakih Temple in Bali, the only Indonesian province where Hinduism is the predominant religion\nThe natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous animism and dynamism, beliefs that are common to Austronesian peoples.[252] They worshipped and revered ancestral spirits and believed that supernatural spirits (*hyang*) might inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or sacred sites.[252] Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese Sunda Wiwitan, Dayak's Kaharingan, and the Javanese KejawÃ¨n. They have significantly impacted how other faiths are practised, evidenced by a large proportion of peopleâsuch as the Javanese abangan, Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christiansâpractising a less orthodox, syncretic form of their religion.[253]\n\n\nHindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE.[254] The Sundanese Kingdom of Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first historically recorded Indianised kingdom in the archipelago.[255] Buddhism arrived around the 6th century,[256] and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhism had their roots around the same period. The archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit, Sailendra, Srivijaya, and Mataram. Though no longer a majority, Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture.[257][258]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh, Aceh. The spread of Islam in Indonesia began in the region.\nIslam was introduced by Sunni traders of the Shafi'i school as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern Arabia as early as the 8th century CE.[259][260] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, resulting in a distinct form of Islam (*santri*).[32][261] Trade, Islamic missionary activity such as by the Wali Sanga and Chinese explorer Zheng He, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of Islam.[262][263] By the end of the 16th century, it had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra.\n\n\n\n![](image)Catholic Mass at the Jakarta Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought by Portuguese traders and missionaries such as Jesuit Francis Xavier, who visited and baptised several thousand locals.[264][265] Its spread faced difficulty due to the Dutch East India Company policy of banning the religion and the Dutch hostility due to the Eighty Years' War against Catholic Spain's rule. Protestantism is mostly a result of Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the Dutch colonial era.[266][267][268] Although they are the most common branch, there is a multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country.[269]\n\n\nThere was a small Jewish presence in the archipelago until 1945, mostly Dutch and some Baghdadi Jews. Since most left after Indonesia proclaimed independence, Judaism was never accorded official status, and only a tiny number of Jews remain today, mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya.[270]\n\n\nAt the national and local level, Indonesia's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith relations, both positively and negatively. The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation, Pancasila[271][272] (i.e. the belief in the one and only God), often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance,[273] though instances of intolerance have occurred.[274][73] An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential and an integral part of life.[275][276]\n\n\n\n### Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Indonesia and Health in Indonesia\n\n![](image)University of Indonesia is one of Indonesia's top universities\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years.[277] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[278] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018).[279] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[279] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java.[280][281] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[282]\n\n\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016.[283] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (*Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional*, JKN) in 2014.[284] It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme. Despite remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019)[285] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019),[286] challenges remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases.[287]\n\n\n\n### Issues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in Indonesia, Organised crime in Indonesia, and Papua conflict\n\n![](image)Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14 May 1998\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua).[288][289] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago[290] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\nIn the social arena, numerous cases of racism and discrimination, especially against Chinese Indonesians and Papuans, have been well documented throughout Indonesia's history.[291][292] Such cases have sometimes led to violent conflicts, most notably the May 1998 riots and the Papua conflict, which has continued since 1962. LGBT people also regularly face challenges. Although LGBT issues have been relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of anti-LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation, discrimination, and even violence.[293][294] In addition, Indonesia has been reported to have sizeable numbers of child and forced labourers, with the former being prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing industry.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Indonesia\n See also: National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia and Public holidays in Indonesia\n\nThe cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia. Influences from the Indian subcontinent, mainland China, the Middle East, Europe,[297][298] Melanesian and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago. As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and multi-ethnic society,[1][2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures. Indonesia currently holds twelve items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik,[299] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance.[300]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian art and Architecture of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: Indonesian painting\n\n![](image)Traditional Balinese painting depicting cockfighting\nIndonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity, Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influencesâmost notably from India, the Arab world, China and Europe, due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade.[301] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry. Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on *candi* bas reliefs in eastern Java.[302]\n\n\n\n![](image)An avenue of Tongkonan houses in a Torajan village, South Sulawesi\nThere have been numerous discoveries of megalithic sculptures in Indonesia.[303] Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak and Toraja.[304][305] Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the 8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation developed refined stone sculpting art and architecture influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. The temples of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the practice.[306]\n\n\nAs with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have brought cultural changes and profound effects on building styles and techniques. The most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant. Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses' (*rumah adat*) styles that have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements vary by ethnic group, and each has a specific custom and history.[307] Examples include Toraja's Tongkonan, Minangkabau's Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay houses, Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of rice barns (*lumbung*).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music, dance and clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Indonesia, Dance in Indonesia, and National costume of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian music and dance. **Clockwise from top**: a gamelan player; Angklung; Sundanese Jaipongan Mojang Priangan dance; and Balinese Pendet dance.\n\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals. Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments. The diverse world of Indonesian music genres results from the musical creativity of its people and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences. These include gambus and qasida from the Middle East,[308] keroncong from Portugal,[309] and dangdutâone of Indonesia's most popular music genresâwith notable Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras.[310] Today, the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei,[311][312] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay.[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cotton wikkelrok with batik geometric pattern\nIndonesian dances have a diverse history, with more than 3,000 original dances. Scholars believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[314] Examples include war dances, a dance of witch doctors, and a dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals such as Hudoq. Indonesian dances derive their influences from the archipelago's prehistoric and tribal, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic periods. Recently, modern dances and urban teen dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture and those of Japan and South Korea to some extent. However, various traditional dances, including those of Java, Bali and Dayak, remain a living and dynamic tradition.[315]\n\n\nIndonesia has various clothing styles due to its long and rich cultural history. The national costume originates from the country's indigenous culture and traditional textile traditions. The Javanese Batik and Kebaya[316] are arguably Indonesia's most recognised national costumes, though they have Sundanese and Balinese origins as well.[317] Each province has a representation of traditional attire and dress,[297] such as Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra; Songket of Malay and Minangkabau from Sumatra; and Ikat of Sasak from Lombok. People wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings, formal ceremonies, music performances, government and official occasions,[317] and they vary from traditional to modern attire.\n\n\n\n### Theatre and cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theatre of Indonesia and Cinema of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: List of highest-grossing films in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Pandava and Krishna in an act of the *Wayang Wong* performance\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata.[318] Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong,[319][320] and various Balinese dance dramas. They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances.[321] Some theatre traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals[322][323] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story.[323] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as *Teater Koma* are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society.[324]\n\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Loetoeng Kasaroeng* (1926), the first fiction film produced in the Dutch East Indies\nThe first film produced in the archipelago was *Loetoeng Kasaroeng*,[325] a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. The film industry expanded after independence, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. Usmar Ismail, who made significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s, is generally considered the pioneer of Indonesian films.[326] The latter part of the Sukarno era saw the use of cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes, and foreign films were subsequently banned, while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order.[327] Production of films peaked during the 1980s, although it declined significantly in the next decade.[325] Notable films in this period include *Pengabdi Setan* (1980), *Nagabonar* (1987), *Tjoet Nja' Dhien* (1988), *Catatan Si Boy* (1989), and Warkop's comedy films.\n\n\nIndependent film making was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998, when films started addressing previously banned topics, such as religion, race, and love.[327] Between 2000 and 2005, the number of films released each year steadily increased.[328] Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed *Kuldesak* (1999), *Petualangan Sherina* (2000), *Ada Apa dengan Cinta?* (2002), and *Laskar Pelangi* (2008). In 2022, *KKN di Desa Penari* smashed box office records, becoming the most-watched Indonesian film with 9.2Â million tickets sold.[329] Indonesia has held annual film festivals and awards, including the Indonesian Film Festival (*Festival Film Indonesia*) held intermittently since 1955. It hands out the Citra Award, the film industry's most prestigious award. From 1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued until its revival in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Mass media and literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mass media in Indonesia and Indonesian literature\n\n![](image)Metro TV at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, reporting the 2010 AFF Championship\nMedia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media.[330] The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989. By the early 21st century, the improved communications system had brought television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11 channels.[331] Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes. The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998.[331]\n\n\nLike other developing countries, Indonesia began developing Internet in the early 1990s. Its first commercial Internet service provider, PT. Indo Internet began operation in Jakarta in 1994.[332] The country had 171Â million Internet users in 2018, with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually.[333] Most are between the ages of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on mobile phones for access, outnumbering laptops and computers.[334]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's most famous novelist. Many considered him to be Southeast Asia's leading candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.[335]\nThe oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia's peoples have firmly rooted oral traditions, which help define and preserve their cultural identities.[336] In written poetry and prose, several traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, hikayat and babad. Examples of these forms include *Syair Abdul Muluk*, *Hikayat Hang Tuah*, *Sulalatus Salatin*, and *Babad Tanah Jawi*.[337]\n\n\nEarly modern Indonesian literature originates in the Sumatran tradition.[338][339] Literature and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence. Balai Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted in 1917 to promote the development of indigenous literature. Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the Golden Age of Indonesian Literature.[340] The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian literature vary according to the dynamics of the country's political and social landscape,[340] most notably the war of independence in the second half of the 1940s and the anti-communist mass killings in the mid-1960s.[341] Notable literary figures of the modern era include Hamka, Chairil Anwar, Mohammad Yamin, Merari Siregar, Marah Roesli, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Ayu Utami.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian cuisine\n\n![](image)*Nasi Padang* with *rendang*, *gulai* and vegetables\nIndonesian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse, vibrant, and colourful, full of intense flavour.[342] Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents.[343] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably chilli), coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[344]\n\n\nSome popular dishes such as *nasi goreng*, *gado-gado*, *sate*, and *soto* are ubiquitous and considered national dishes. The Ministry of Tourism, however, chose *tumpeng* as the official national dish in 2014, describing it as binding the diversity of various culinary traditions.[345] Other popular dishes include *rendang*, one of the many Minangkabau cuisines along with *dendeng* and *gulai*. Another fermented food is *oncom*, similar in some ways to *tempeh* but uses a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and is prevalent in West Java.[346]\n\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in Indonesia and Indonesian martial arts\n\n![](image)A demonstration of *Pencak Silat*, a form of martial artsBadminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia. Indonesia is among the few countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's and women's badminton. Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia's Olympic medal tally. Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league. On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as the Dutch East Indies.[347] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as three gold medals at the 1987, 1991 and 2023 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 and successfully qualified for a total of five tournaments, although they never make the knockout phase.[348]\n\n\nOther popular sports include boxing and basketball, which has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first National Games (*Pekan Olahraga Nasional*, PON) in 1948.[349] *Sepak takraw* and *karapan sapi* (bull racing) in Madura are some examples of Indonesia's traditional sports. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as *caci* in Flores and *pasola* in Sumba. *Pencak Silat* is an Indonesian martial art and, in 2018, became one of the sporting events in the Asian Games, with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the top sports powerhouses by topping the SEA Games medal table ten times since 1977,[350] most recently in 2011.[351]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* List of Indonesia-related topics\n* Index of Indonesia-related articles\n* Outline of Indonesia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** UK: /ËÉªndÉËniËziÉ, -ÊÉ/ *IN-dÉ-NEE-zee-É, -â zhÉ* US: /ËÉªndÉËniËÊÉ, -ÊÉ/ â *IN-dÉ-NEE-zhÉ, -â shÉ*;[10][11] Indonesian pronunciation: [ÉªndoËnesia]\n2. **^** *Republik Indonesia* ([reËpublik ÉªndoËnesia] â) is the most-used official name, though the name Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (*Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia*, NKRI) also appears in some official documents.\n3. **^** During the IndonesiaâMalaysia confrontation, Indonesia withdrew from the UN due to the latter's election to the United Nations Security Council, although it returned 18 months later.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\n\n\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\nBy 1200Â BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the *Rigveda*. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the *Rigveda* records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\nBy 400Â BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\n\n\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[43]\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[44]\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49]\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\n\n\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4Â billion in 2022.[61]\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. It is the fourth country to land a craft on the moon and the first to do so within 600 kilometres (370Â mi) of the Lunar south pole.[64] Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names for India\n\nAccording to the *Oxford English Dictionary* (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin *India*, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek *India* ( *á¼¸Î½Î´Î¯Î±*), ancient Greek *Indos* ( *á¼¸Î½Î´ÏÏ*), Old Persian *Hindush* (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit *Sindhu*, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[73][74] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as *Indoi* (*á¼¸Î½Î´Î¿Î¯*), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[75]\n\n\nThe term *Bharat* (*BhÄrat*; pronounced [ËbÊ±aËÉ¾Ét] â), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[76][77] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name *Bharatavarsha*, which applied originally to North India,[78][79] *Bharat* gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[76][80]\n\n\n*Hindustan* ([É¦ÉªndÊËstaËn] â) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of *Hindustan* has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[76][80][82]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\n\n### Ancient India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manuscript illustration, c.â1650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.â400Â BCEÂ â c.â300Â CE[83]\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or *Homo sapiens*, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500Â BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500â1900Â BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]\n\n\nDuring the period 2000â500Â BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the *mahajanapadas*.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[100] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[101][102] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist *dhamma*.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200Â BCE and 200Â CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[105][106] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[107][100] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[108][109] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[110] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[109] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[109]\n\n\n\n### Medieval India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010Â CE\n![](image)\nThe Qutub Minar, 73Â m (240Â ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200Â CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[111] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647Â CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[111] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[113]\n\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[114] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[116]\n\n\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[118][119] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[120][121] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[123] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[122]\n\n\n\n### Early modern India[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[128] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort\n![](image)\nA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IV, King\"\n\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[135][136] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[137][135][138][139] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[140] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[135] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[141]\n\n\n\n### Modern India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Republic of India\n\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changesâamong them, railways, canals, and the telegraphâwere introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]\n\n\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[157] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n1909 map of the British Indian Empire\n![](image)\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\n\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[159] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[160] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[161] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World WarÂ II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[162]\n\n\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[163] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[164] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[165] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[166] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[167] by religious and caste-related violence;[168] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[169] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[170] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[171] and with Pakistan.[171] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[172]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of India\n\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[173] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[173] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[173] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[173] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[174] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[175] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[176][177][178]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna river.[179]\n![](image)\nFishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\n\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[180] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[181] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6Â° 44â² and 35Â° 30â² north latitude[m] and 68Â° 7â² and 97Â° 25â² east longitude.[182]\n\n\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700Â mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400Â mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300Â mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[183] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[183]\n\n\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[184] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[185][186] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[187] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[188] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[189] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[190]\n\n\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[191] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[192][193] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[191] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[194]\n\n\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7Â Â°C (1.3Â Â°F) between 1901 and 2018.[195] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[196] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[197]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\n\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[198] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[199][200] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[201] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[n][202]\n\n\nAccording to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789Â km2 (275,595Â sqÂ mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area.[71] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of *canopy density*, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[203] *Very dense forest*, whose *canopy density* is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. *Moderately dense forest*, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous *sal* forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[205] *Open forest*, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[203][204] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[206]\n\n\nAmong the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent *Azadirachta indica*, or *neem*, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[207] and the luxuriant *Ficus religiosa*, or *peepul*,[208] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[209] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[210]\n\n\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[211] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[212] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[213] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[200] Among endemics are the vulnerable[214] hooded leaf monkey[215] and the threatened[216] Beddome's toad[216][217] of the Western Ghats.\n\n\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[218] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[219] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[220] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[221] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[222] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteenÂ biosphere reserves,[223] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[224]\n\n\n\n* ![India has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]](image)\n\nIndia has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]\n* ![A chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.](image)\n\nA chital (*Axis axis*) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.\n* ![Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

V.[226]\n\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[227] India has sixÂ recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50Â regional parties.[228] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[229] and the BJP right-wing.[230][231][232] For most of the period between 1950âwhen India first became a republicâand the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[233] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[234]\n\n\nIn the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[235] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[236]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\n\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[237] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.[238] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[239] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[240] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2022.[241]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\n\n![](image)\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[242]\n\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of Indiaâthe country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic.\n\n\nFederalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[243] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[244] India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[245] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[246][247]\n\n\n\n\n\nNational symbols[1]| Emblem | Sarnath Lion Capital |\n| Anthem | *Jana Gana Mana* |\n| Song | \"Vande Mataram\" |\n| Language | None[248][249][250] |\n| Currency | â¹ (Indian rupee) |\n| Calendar | Shaka |\n| Bird | Indian peafowl |\n| Flower | Lotus |\n| Fruit | Mango |\n| Mammal | * Bengal tiger\n* River dolphin\n |\n| Tree | Banyan |\n| River | Ganges |\n\n\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[251]\n\n\n\n* Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[252] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[253][254] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[255] Appointed by the president,[256] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[255] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministersâwith the cabinet being its executive committeeâheaded by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[252] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[257]\n* Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[258] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245Â members who serve staggered six-year terms.[259] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[256] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545Â members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-yearÂ terms.[260] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped.[261][262]\n* Judiciary: India has a three-tierÂ unitary independent judiciary[263] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25Â high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[263] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[264] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[265] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[266]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\n\nSee also: Political integration of India\n\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[13] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[267] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)A clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### States[edit]\n\n\n1.

Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[273] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'Ã©tat attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[274]\n\n\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[275] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[276] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[277] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[278][279]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009. The parade at which India was the foreign guest was led by India's oldest regiment, the Maratha Light Infantry, founded in 1768.[280]\n\nChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[281] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[282] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[283][284] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[285][286] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of *Vikrant*-class aircraft carriers and *Arihant*-class nuclear submarines.[287]\n\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[288] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[289] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[290] France,[291] the United Kingdom,[292] and Canada.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\n\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45Â million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[294] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03Â billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[295] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12Â billion for fiscal year 2022â23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[296][297] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[298] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[299] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[300] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43Â billion (over â¹400Â billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system.[301]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of India\n\n![](image)\nA farmer in northwestern Karnataka ploughs his field with a tractor even as another in a field beyond does the same with a pair of oxen. In 2019, 43% of India's total workforce was employed in agriculture.[302]\n![](image)\nIndia is the world's largest producer of milk, with the largest population of cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking.[304]\n![](image)\nWomen tend to a recently planted rice field in Junagadh district in Gujarat. 55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019.[303]\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46Â trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, around $11.6Â trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[305] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011â2012,[306] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[307] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[308] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[309] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[310][311] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[312] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[313]\n\n\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2017[update].[294] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100Â billion in 2022,[314] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[315] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[13] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[13] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[310] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[316] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[317] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[13] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[13] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[318] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[319]\n\n\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[310] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[320] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580Â million by 2030.[321] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[322] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[323] With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[324] India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[325] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest,[*as of?*] is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[321]\n\n\nDriven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,466 by 2022.[17] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of Bangalore, the centre of India's software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up centres in India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding region.[326]\n\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[327] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[327] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[327] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[328]\n\n\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[329]\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA tea garden in Sikkim. India, the world's second-largest producer of tea, is a nation of one billion tea drinkers, who consume 70% of India's tea output.\n\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2Â billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP.[330] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China.[331]\n\n\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009â2010,[332] and exports by 36% during 2008â2009.[333] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan.[334] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8Â million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100Â billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[335]\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50â60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44Â billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42Â billion.[336][337] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[338][339] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012â2013, increasing its revenues from â¹204.4Â billion (Indian rupees) to â¹235.24Â billion (US$3.94Â billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[340]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in India and Energy policy of India\n\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[341] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[342] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[343][344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[345]\n\n\n\n### Socio-economic challenges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHealth workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious diseases in 2006. Eight years later, and three years after India's last case of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free.[346]\n\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[348] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[p][350] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight.[351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[352][353] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[354]\n\n\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8Â million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[355] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1Â million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6Â million from 12.6Â million in 2001.[356]\n\n\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\n\n\nEpidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 recently.[360]\n\n\n\n## Demographics, languages and religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of India, Languages of India, and Religion in India\n\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\n\nIndia by language\n![](image)\nThe language families of South Asia\n\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[361] India was the world's second-most populous country.[q] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[363] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991â2001).[363] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[361] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[294] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361Â million people.[364] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[365]\n\n\nThe life expectancy in India is at 70 yearsâ71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[294] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[366] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[367] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[368][369] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[370] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[371] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[372] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[370] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[372]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Christianity is believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by Syriac-speaking Christians.\n\nAmong speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[373] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[374][375] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\n\n\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[12] India has the third-largest Muslim populationâthe largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\n\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[378] During the Vedic period (c.â1700Â BCEÂ â c.â500Â BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as *dhÃ¡rma*, *kÃ¡rma*, *yÃ³ga*, and *moká¹£a*, were established.[75] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[379] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the *Upanishads*,[380] the *Yoga Sutras*, the *Bhakti* movement,[379] and by Buddhist philosophy.[381]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian art\n\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[382] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928â29, is the best known.[383][384] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[384][385] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[386][387][388] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[389] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing *prana* (\"breath\" or life-force).[390][391] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[392][393]\n\n\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[394] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[395][396] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[397] Gupta art, at its peak c.â300Â CEÂ â c.â500Â CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[398][399] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.â800Â CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[400] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[401][402]\n\n\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[403][404] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[405] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[406][407] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as NihÃ¢l Chand and Nainsukh.[408][409] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[410][411] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[412][413]\n\n\n\n* ![Bhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd centuryÂ CE](image)\n\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd centuryÂ CE\n* ![Gupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century](image)\n\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\n* ![Elephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5Â m) tall, c.â550](image)\n\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (*trimurti*) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5Â m) tall, c.â550\n* ![Chola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century](image)\n\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\n* ![Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c.â1635](image)\n\n*Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign*, Balchand, c.â1635\n* ![Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775â1785](image)\n\n*Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids*, Kangra painting, 1775â1785\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of India\n\n![](image)\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a *jawab* (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\n\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[414] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. *Vastu shastra*, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[415] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[416] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[417] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the *Shilpa Shastras*, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the *Vastu-Purusha mandala*, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[418] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\".[419] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[420]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian literature\n\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500Â BCE and 1200Â CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[421] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the *Rigveda* (c.â1500Â BCEÂ â c.â1200Â BCE), the epics: *MahÄbhÄrata* (c.â400Â BCEÂ â c.â400Â CE) and the *Ramayana* (c.â300Â BCE and later); *AbhijÃ±ÄnaÅÄkuntalam* (*The Recognition of ÅakuntalÄ*, and other dramas of KÄlidÄsa (c.â5th centuryÂ CE) and *MahÄkÄvya* poetry.[422][423][424] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.â600Â BCEÂ â c.â300Â BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[425][426][427][428] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like KabÄ«r, TulsÄ«dÄs, and Guru NÄnak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[429] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[430] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n\n### Performing arts and media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\n\n![](image)\nIndia's National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be *classical*. One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\n\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[431] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the *bauls* is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: *bhangra* of Punjab, *bihu* of Assam, *Jhumair* and *chhau* of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, *garba* and *dandiya* of Gujarat, *ghoomar* of Rajasthan, and *lavani* of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: *bharatanatyam* of the state of Tamil Nadu, *kathak* of Uttar Pradesh, *kathakali* and *mohiniyattam* of Kerala, *kuchipudi* of Andhra Pradesh, *manipuri* of Manipur, *odissi* of Odisha, and the *sattriya* of Assam.[432]\n\n\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[433] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the *bhavai* of Gujarat, the *jatra* of West Bengal, the *nautanki* and *ramlila* of North India, *tamasha* of Maharashtra, *burrakatha* of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, *terukkuttu* of Tamil Nadu, and the *yakshagana* of Karnataka.[434] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi. It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[435]\nThe Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.[436] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[437] The Hindi language film industry (*Bollywood*) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[438]\n\n\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[439][440] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[441] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462Â million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350Â million), radio (156Â million) or internet (37Â million).[442]\n\n\n\n### Society[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMuslims offer *namaz* at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as *jÄtis*, or \"castes\".[443] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\n\n\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[444] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[445] Marriage is thought to be for life,[445] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[446] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[447] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[448] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63Â million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate.[449] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[450] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[451] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[452] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[453]\n\n\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[454][455]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\n\n![](image)Children awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation *Jai Bhim* written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[456][457] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[458]\n\n\nThe education system of India is the world's second-largest.[459] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[460] and 1.5Â million schools.[461] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[462][463]\n\n\n\n### Clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clothing in India\n\n![](image)\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil Nadu\n![](image)\nA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\n\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[464] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[464] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[464] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's endâpassing over the shoulderâserving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours.[464] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[465]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\n\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c.â1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c.â1525 CE).[466] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[466] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[466]\n\n\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[467] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[468] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[469] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[470]\n\n\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[471] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[471] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[471] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[471] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[472]\nis seldom seen in the cities.[471]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platter\n![](image)\nRailway mutton curry from Odisha\n\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[473] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[474] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[475] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[473] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[476]\n\n\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixingâfor example of rice and lentilsâor folding, wrapping, scooping or dippingâsuch as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[473]\n\n\n\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[477]\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[478] The appearance of *ahimsa*, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[478] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[479] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[480]\n\n\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[481] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[482] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[483] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[483] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[483] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[484] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chickenâcooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asiaâdates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[478]\n\n\n\n### Sports and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in India\n\n![](image)\nGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[485]\n\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as *kabaddi*, *kho kho*, *pehlwani* and *gilli-danda*, and also martial arts such as *Kalarippayattu* and *marma adi*, remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as *chaturaá¹ga*;[486] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[487] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013. He also won the Chess World Cup in 2000 and 2002. In 2023, R Praggnanandhaa finished as runners up in the tournament. [488] Parcheesi is derived from *Pachisi*, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[489]\n\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[490] Major domestic leagues include the Indian Premier League. Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi league.[491][492][493]\n\n\n\n![](image)Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar about to score a record 14,000 runs in Test cricket while playing against Australia in Bangalore, 2010\nIndia has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition, as well as becoming the inaugural T20 World Cup Champions in 2007. India has also won the Champions Trophy twice, in 2002 and 2013. The only edition of the World Championship of Cricket was won by India in 1985. \n\n\nIndia also has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics.[494]\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[495] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[496][497] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[498] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[499] and wrestling.[500] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won four out of five tournaments to date.[501][502]\n\n\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2031); the 1978, 1997 and 2013 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2025); the 1987, 1985 and 2016 South Asian Games; the 1990-91 Men's Asia Cup; the 2002 Chess World Cup; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Cricket Champion's Trophy (and is also scheduled to host it in 2029); the 2006 Women's Asia Cup; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; the 2016 ICC Men's Cricket T20 World Cup (and is also scheduled to host it in 2026); the 2016 ICC Women's Cricket T20 World Cup and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[503]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Administrative divisions of India\n* Outline of India\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Originally written in Sanskritised Bengali and adopted as the national anthem in its Hindi translation.\n2. **^** \"[...] *Jana Gana Mana* is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song *Vande Mataram*, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with *Jana Gana Mana* and shall have equal status with it.\"[5]\n3. **^** Written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Sanskritised Bengali.\n4. **^** According to Part XVII of the Constitution of India, Hindi in the Devanagari script is the official language of the Union, along with English as an additional official language.[1][6][7] States and union territories can have a different official language of their own other than Hindi or English.\n5. **^** Not all the state-level official languages are in the eighth schedule and not all the scheduled languages are state-level official languages.

(The Rigveda) consists of 1,028 hymns (suktas), highly crafted poetic compositions originally intended for recital during rituals and for the invocation of and communication with the Indo-Aryan gods. Modern scholarly opinion largely agrees that these hymns were composed between around 1500Â BCE and 1200Â BCE, during the eastward migration of the Indo-Aryan tribes from the mountains of what is today northern Afghanistan across the Punjab into north India.\n33. **^** (a) Witzel, Michael (2008). \"Vedas and Upanisads\".

It is known from internal evidence that the Vedic texts were orally composed in northern India, at first in the Greater Punjab and later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 BCE and ca. 500â400 BCE. The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with the Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450â1350 BCE); ... The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a *tape-recording* of ca. 1500â500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. (pp. 68â69) ...

The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\"\n  \n(d) Dyson 2018, pp.Â 14â15, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually aroseâa people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'âwas certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other featuresâprobably including some surviving Harappan influencesâthat were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya peopleâespecially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epicsâare poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";   \n (e) Robb 2011, pp.Â 46â, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE.

Most other rituals have lost their popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened. Although *samskaras* vary from region to region, from class (*varna*) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the *Brahmin* priests.

She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.\n58. **^** Talbot, Ian; Singh, Gurharpal (2009), *The Partition of India*, Cambridge University Press, ISBNÂ 978-0-521-85661-4, archived from the original on 13 December 2016, retrieved 15 November 2015, When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ...

It is likely, therefore, that the epic-like elements found in Vedic sources and the two epics that we have are not directly related, but that both drew on the same source, an oral tradition of storytelling that existed before, throughout, and after the Vedic period.\n84. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Coningham & Young 2015, pp.Â 104â105.\n85. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, pp.Â 21â23.\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Singh 2009, p.Â 181.\n87. **^** Possehl 2003, p.Â 2.\n88. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Singh 2009, p.Â 255.\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Singh 2009, pp.Â 186â187.\n90. **^** Witzel 2003, pp.Â 68â69.\n91. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, pp.Â 41â43.\n92. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Singh 2009, pp.Â 250â251.\n93. **^** Singh 2009, pp.Â 260â265.\n94. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, pp.Â 53â54.\n95. **^** Singh 2009, pp.Â 312â313.\n96. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, pp.Â 54â56.\n97. **^** Stein 1998, p.Â 21.\n98. **^** Stein 1998, pp.Â 67â68.\n99. **^** Singh 2009, p.Â 300.\n100. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Singh 2009, p.Â 319.\n101. **^** Stein 1998, pp.Â 78â79.\n102. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, p.Â 70.\n103. **^** Singh 2009, p.Â 367.\n104. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, p.Â 63.\n105. **^** Stein 1998, pp.Â 89â90.\n106. **^** Singh 2009, pp.Â 408â415.\n107. **^** Stein 1998, pp.Â 92â95.\n108. **^** Kulke & Rothermund 2004, pp.Â 89â91.\n109. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Singh 2009, p.Â 545.\n110. **^** Stein 1998, pp.Â 98â99.\n111. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stein 1998, p.Â 132.\n112. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Stein 1998, pp.Â 119â120.\n113. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stein 1998, pp.Â 121â122.\n114. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stein 1998, p.Â 123.\n115. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stein 1998, p.Â 124.\n116. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stein 1998, pp.Â 127â128.\n117. **^** Ludden 2002, p.Â 68.\n118. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 47.\n119. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.Â 6.\n120. **^** Ludden 2002, p.Â 67.\n121. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, pp.Â 50â51.\n122. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 53.\n123. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.Â 12.\n124. **^** Robb 2001, p.Â 80.\n125. **^** Stein 1998, p.Â 164.\n126. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 115.\n127. **^** Robb 2001, pp.Â 90â91.\n128. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.Â 17.\n129. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 152.\n130. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 158.\n131. **^** Stein 1998, p.Â 169.\n132. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 186.\n133. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 23â24.\n134. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 256.\n135. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 286.\n136. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 44â49.\n137. **^** Robb 2001, pp.Â 98â100.\n138. **^** Ludden 2002, pp.Â 128â132.\n139. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 51â55.\n140. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 68â71.\n141. **^** Asher & Talbot 2008, p.Â 289.\n142. **^** Robb 2001, pp.Â 151â152.\n143. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 94â99.\n144. **^** Brown 1994, p.Â 83.\n145. **^** Peers 2006, p.Â 50.\n146. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 100â103.\n147. **^** Brown 1994, pp.Â 85â86.\n148. **^** Stein 1998, p.Â 239.\n149. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, pp.Â 103â108.\n150. **^** Robb 2001, p.Â 183.\n151. **^** Sarkar 1983, pp.Â 1â4.\n152. **^** Copland 2001, pp.Â ixâx.\n153. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.Â 123.\n154. **^** Stein 1998, p.Â 260.\n155. **^** Stein 2010, p.Â 245: An expansion of state functions in British and in princely India occurred as a result of the terrible famines of the later nineteenth century, ...

The Nehru-Zhou Enlai Summit of 1960\", in Bhagavan, Manu (ed.), *India and the Cold War*, University of North Carolina Press, p.Â 121, ISBNÂ 978-1-4696-5117-0, The 'forward policy' adopted by India to prevent the Chinese from occupying territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be cautious in dealing with India owing to Moscow's stance on the dispute and its growing proximity to India. These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating defeat in the war of OctoberâNovember 1962.\n272. **^** Brahma Chellaney (2006). *Asian Juggernaut: The Rise of China, India, and Japan*.

Idli cakes are soft, moist and spongy, have desirable sour flavour, and is eaten as breakfast in South India. Dosa batter is very similar to idli batter, except that both the rice and black gram are finely grounded. The batter is thinner than that of idli and is fried as a thin, crisp pancake and eaten directly in South India.\n476. **^** Jhala, Angma Day (2015), *Royal Patronage, Power and Aesthetics in Princely India*, Routledge, p.Â 70, ISBNÂ 978-1-317-31657-2, With the ascent of the Mughal Empire in sixteenth-century India, Turkic, Persian and Afghan traditions of dress, 'architecture and cuisine' were adopted by non-Muslim indigenous elites in South Asia. In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\n477. **^** Panjabi, Camellia (1995), *The Great Curries of India*, Simon and Schuster, pp.Â 158â, ISBNÂ 978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like *naan*, *Khamiri roti*, ...\n478. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davidson, Alan (2014), *The Oxford Companion to Food*, Oxford University Press, p.Â 410, ISBNÂ 978-0-19-967733-7\n479. **^** Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), *Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific*, Taylor & Francis, p.Â 50, ISBNÂ 978-1-317-31050-1\n480. **^** OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), *OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018â2027*, OECD Publishing, p.Â 21, ISBNÂ 978-92-64-06203-0\n481. **^** Roger 2000.\n482. **^** Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), *Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History*, University of California Press, p.Â 74, ISBNÂ 978-0-520-27745-8\n483. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Collingham, Elizabeth M.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861â1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market.

It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on AprilÂ 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492â1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakeningâa series of Christian revivalsâfueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763â1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776â1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn JulyÂ 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c.â1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the MasonâDixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789â1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789â1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the MexicanâAmerican War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860â1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849â1865) and 1865â1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861â1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160Â million acres (650Â thousandÂ km2; 250Â thousandÂ sqÂ mi)ânearly 10Â percent of the total area of the United Statesâwere given away free to 1.6Â million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876â1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865â1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the SpanishâAmerican War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the JonesâShafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914â1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918â1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945âpresent)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945â1964), 1964â1980, 1980â1991, and 1991â2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007â2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470Â km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River Systemâthe world's fourth longest river systemâruns mainly northâsouth through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300Â m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135Â km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5Â m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands.

East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment.

Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United StatesâMexicoâCanada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[262]\n\n\nThe United States spent $877 billion on its military in 2022, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 39% of global military spending and accounting for 3.5% of the country's GDP.***[263]***[264] The U.S. has more than 40% of the world's nuclear weapons, the second-largest amount after Russia.[265]\n\n\nThe United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[266] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[267] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[268]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in the United States, Crime in the United States, and Censorship in the United States\n\n![](image)J. Edgar Hoover Building, the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nThere are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to federal level in the United States.[269] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[270] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials,[271] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals of state court decisions.[272]\n\n\nAs of January 2023, the United States has the sixth highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, at 531 people per 100,000; and the largest prison and jail population in the world with almost 2Â million people incarcerated.[273][274][275] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates \"were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"[276]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the United States\n\nFurther information: Economic history of the United States and Tourism in the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency.[277]\n![](image)The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization[278]\n![](image)Apple Park, in Cupertino, California, within Silicon Valley, is the headquarters of Apple Inc., the world's biggest company by market capitalization.[279]\nThe U.S. has been the world's largest economy since at least 1900.[280] The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $25.5Â trillion is the largest of any country in the world, constituting over 25% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 15% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[281][13] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the Group of Seven.[282] The country ranks first in the world by disposable income per capita, nominal GDP,[283] second by GDP (PPP),[13] seventh by nominal GDP per capita,[281] and eighth by GDP (PPP) per capita.[13]\n\n\nOf the world's 500 largest companies, 136 are headquartered in the U.S.[284] The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market.[277] Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the *de facto* currency.[285][286] It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA.[287] The U.S. ranked second in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore.[288] While its economy has reached a post-industrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.[289] As of 2018, the U.S. is the second-largest manufacturing nation after China.[290] In 2021, the U.S. was both the world's largest exporter and importer of engines.[291]\n\n\nNew York City is the world's principal financial center, with the largest economic output, and the epicenter of the principal American metropolitan economy.[292][293][294] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both located in New York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume.[295][296] The United States is at or near the forefront of technological advancement and innovation[297] in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; computers; pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment.[298] The nation's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.[299] It has the second-highest total-estimated value of natural resources after Russia.[300] The largest U.S. trading partners are the European Union, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan.[301] The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter after China.[302] It is by far the world's largest exporter of services.[303]\n\n\nAmericans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states,[304] and the fourth-highest median household income,[305] up from sixth-highest in 2013.[306] Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%.[307] Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs,[308] with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income[309] and giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD members.[310] The U.S. ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires, with 724 billionaires[311] and nearly 22 million millionaires (as of 2021).[312] There were about 582,500 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in 2022, with 60% staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[313] In 2018 six million children experience food insecurity.[314] Feeding America estimates that around one in seven, or approximately 11 million, children experience hunger and do not know where they will get their next meal or when.[315] As of JuneÂ 2018,[update] 40Â million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3Â million children.[316]\n\n\nThe United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries.[317][318] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally[319] and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[320] The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[321]\n\n\n\n### Science, technology, and energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in the United States, Science policy of the United States, Telecommunications in the United States, and Energy in the United States\n\n![](image)U.S. astronaut Buzz Aldrin saluting the flag on the Moon during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. The United States is the only country that has sent crewed missions to the lunar surface.\nThe United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled America's large-scale manufacturing of consumer products in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[322] In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[323] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[324] In 2022, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[325]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil fuels.[326] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%), coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[326] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[327][328] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[329]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in the United States\n\n![](image)HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 93 million passengers annually in 2022.[330]\nPersonal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[331][332] which operate on a network of 4Â million miles (6.4Â million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[333][334] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[335] and mass-affordable[336] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.[337] Currently, the American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[338] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, [339] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[340] The United States's rail network, the longest in the world,[341] handles mostly freight.[342][343]\n\n\nThe American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[344] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[345] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport.[346][347] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[348]\n\n\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[349] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009Â km (25,482Â mi).[350]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United States\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on JanuaryÂ 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[357] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[358][359] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population.[357] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[357] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[352]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United States\n\n![](image)Most spoken languages in USA\nWhile many languages are spoken in the United States, English is overwhelmingly the most commonly spoken in a majority of the country.[360] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some lawsâsuch as U.S. naturalization requirementsâstandardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[361] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[362] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[n][363] South Dakota (Sioux),[364] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[365]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7Â million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3Â million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2Â million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5Â million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc.

New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonismâa Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th centuryâis the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![DallasâFort Worth](image)DallasâFort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | RiversideâSan Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | DallasâFort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | MinneapolisâSaint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | TampaâSt. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American IndianâAlaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016â2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7Â trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *nÃ©gritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise GlÃ¼ck, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of SeptemberÂ 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018â19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as BeyoncÃ©, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including RenÃ©e Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69Â billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[76] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury.[77] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n445. **^** Ho, Patricia Jiayi (12 January 2010). \"China Overtakes U.S. to Become Largest Auto Market\". *Wall Street Journal*.

This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610Â km2 (3,618,780Â sqÂ mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091Â km2 (3,717,813Â sqÂ mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517Â km2 (3,796,742Â sqÂ mi)).

The earliest Chinese dynastic states, such as the Shang and the Zhou, emerged in the basin of the Yellow River before the late second millennium BCE. The eighth to third centuries BCE saw a breakdown in Zhou authority and significant conflict, as well as the emergence of Classical Chinese literature and philosophy. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor for the first time, ushering in more than two millennia in which China was governed by one or more imperial dynasties, including the Han, Tang, Ming and Qing. Some of China's most notable achievementsâsuch as the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wallâoccurred during this period. The Chinese cultureâincluding languages, traditions, architecture, philosophy and moreâhas heavily influenced East Asia during this imperial period.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe People's Republic of China is a one-party state governed by the MarxistâLeninist Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This makes China one of the world's last countries governed by a communist party. The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" and that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism.\"[200] The main body of the constitution also declares that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China.\"[201]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, is famed for having united the Warring States' walls to form the Great Wall of China.

It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n527. **^** \"Eastern stars: Universities of China's C9 League excel in select fields\". *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. 17 February 2011.

In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus here is particularly on building efficient transport routes. The focus is particularly on the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe and there are Chinese investments or related declarations of intent at numerous ports such as Gwadar, Kuantan, Hambantota, Piraeus and Trieste.

However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan Rebellion in the 8th century.[66] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and Khitan Liao.

As of 2020[update], 58.42 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[512] Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[511] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges nationwide every year.[513]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[68] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.[69][70] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty.

At that time, the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign.[529]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Bureau of Statistics estimated that the population fell 850,000 from 2021 to 2022, the first decline since 1961.[473]\n\n\nAccording to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth[474] or the size of the total population.[475] However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.[476] The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth.[477][478] The 2020 census found that males accounted for 51.2% of the total population.[479] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.8% of the population.[480]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Tanner, Harold M.

The Republic saw consistent conflict for most of the mid-20th century, including a civil war between the Kuomintang government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which began in 1927, as well as the Second Sino-Japanese War that began in 1937 and continued until 1945, therefore becoming involved in World War II. The latter led to a temporary stop in the civil war and numerous Japanese atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre, which continue to influence ChinaâJapan relations. In 1949, the CCP established control over China as the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan. Early communist rule saw two major projects: the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in a sharp economic decline and massive famine; and the Cultural Revolution, a movement to purge all non-communist elements of Chinese society that led to mass violence and persecution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music.

Chinese culture, in turn, has heavily influenced East Asia and Southeast Asia.[573] For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty.[574] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.[575] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.[576]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the 2007â08 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[369] To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the Renminbi. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n376. **^** \"Chancellor George Osborne cements London as renminbi hub\". *Financial Times*.

China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.[108]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and the People's Republic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the People's Republic of China\n\nFurther information: Chinese Soviet Republic; Proclamation of the People's Republic of China; Retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan; Taiwan, China; and Cultural Revolution\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOver the millennia, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \"three teachings\", including Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (Chinese Buddhism), historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture,[559][560] enriching a theological and spiritual framework which harks back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty. Chinese popular or folk religion, which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions,[561] consists in allegiance to the *shen* (ç¥), a character that signifies the \"energies of generation\", who can be deities of the environment or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history.[562] Among the most popular cults are those of Mazu (goddess of the seas),[563] Huangdi (one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese race),[563][564] Guandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStarting with the Tang dynasty,[603] Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of neighboring East Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.[604] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.[605][606]\n\n\nChinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies),[607] a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from *pagodas* to palaces.[597][604]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed,[60] whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the Four Classics of Chinese literature. At its end, Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects, largely integrating them into Chinese culture. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBRICS\n |\n| --- |\n| Membership | * ![Brazil](image) Brazil\n* ![Russia](image) Russia\n* ![India](image) India\n* ![China](image) China\n* ![South Africa](image) South Africa\n* ![](image)Â Egypt Egypt\n* ![](image) Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Iran\n* ![](image) United Arab Emirates\n |\n| Summits | 1.

Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[101] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.[102] During the war, China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were referred to as \"trusteeship of the powerful\"[103] and were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.[104][105] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[106][107] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was handed over to Chinese control. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals.[*citation needed*] They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state.[*citation needed*] Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the CCP's rule under Mao Zedong damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as \"regressive and harmful\" or \"vestiges of feudalism\".[*citation needed*] Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n372. **^** Kramer, Andrew E.

Within the framework of this ideology, religion was treated as a 'contorted' world-view and people believed that religion would necessarily disappear at the end, along with the development of human society. A series of anti-religious campaigns was implemented by the Chinese Communist Party from the early 1950s to the late 1970s. As a result, in nearly 30 years between the beginning of the 1950s and the end of the 1970s, mosques (as well as churches and Chinese temples) were shut down and Imams involved in forced 're-education'.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n553. **^** Yin æ®·, Haishan æµ·å±±; Li æ, Yaozong èå®; Guo é­, Jie æ´, eds.
